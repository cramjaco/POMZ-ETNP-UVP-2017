I am looking over what I have done, with an eye towards writing a manuscript. Lots of files, lets figure out what each does, and which depend on which.

Also, I'm over in the POMZ-EK60 file processing the ek60 data. I'd like to show where the plankton are for realsies.

I appear to have left off the non-power law assumption disaggregation thing stuck.
