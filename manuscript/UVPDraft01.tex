\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

Models and observations suggest that that particle flux attenuation is
lower across the mesopelagic zone of anoxic environments compared to
oxic ones. This attenuation is likely a function of microbial
metabolism, as well as agregation and disaggregation by zooplankton.
Analysis of particle size spectra provide insight into the relative
roles of aggregation, disaggregation and remineralization.

We measured particle size profiles at a station in the core of the
Eastern Tropical North Pacific Oxygen Minimum Zone (ETNP OMZ) using an
underwater vision profiler (UVP) multiple times of day, at different
times of day, over the course of a week. We normalized our UVP
measurements by comparing them to particle flux measurements measured by
sediment traps. We also explored how our measurements related to
acoustic observations of migratory marine species. We also compared our
observations to UVP measurements from a site at a similar latitudes but
with non limiting oxygen concentrations.

Particle numbers and size distributions showed a non monotocinc trend,
with sharp decreases in particle numbers the photic zone and the lower
500m of the OMZ, but increases in the top 350 m of the OMZ and below the
OMZ. These increases in particle number generally concurred with
increases in the particle size distribution slope suggesting that the
increase in particle numbers were due to a production of small
particles.

Particle flux at our site was characterized by rapid attenuation in the
top layer of the OMZ followed by either low attenuation or a small
increase in abundance, depending on the day of the study, around 500m.
This region coresponded with the presence of migratory plankton that
spent the day in this region.

A model of particle remineralization and shrinking was used to diagnose
whether particle size patterns violated the assumption that particles
only sink and remineralize, and are neither aggregated, disaggregated,
or tranported by zooplnkton. Our model identified aggregation like
processes between 250 and 500m of in the water column that occurred at
all time-points.

Our data suggest a role of zooplantkon in transporting biomass in the
form of fecal pellets, into the core of the OMZ, but also in
disaggregating particles in this same region. We further observe that
there is temporal varibility in flux transport, but that this
variability is small, only accounting for \textasciitilde{}X \% of the
variability in flux, and not accounting for variability in particle
numbers or size distribution over the one week time period studied.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The biological pump is a key part of the global carbon cycle in
    which, sinking particles transport carbon from the surface into the
    deep ocean. (Turner 2015; Neuer 2014) (Neuer, Iversen, and Fischer
    2014; Turner 2015).
  \item
    Flux into the deep ocean is a function of both export from the
    photic zone into the mesopelegic (export flux), and the fraction of
    that flux that crosses the mesopelegic (transfer efficiency) (Ref).
  \item
    Much has been said about particle dynamics in the surface and their
    relation to export flux (Jackson and Burd; Jokulsdottr; Kriest;
    Others)
  \item
    Transfer efficiency, the flux between the base of the photic zone
    and the deep ocean (Francois 2002) (Francois et al. 2002) is
    important in particular, because the depth to which carbon is
    transported may affect global atmospheric carbon levels (Kwon)
    (Kwon, Primeau, and Sarmiento 2009)
  \item
    Zooplankton can affect particle flux in the mesopelegic in several
    ways (Turner 2015; Steinberg and Landry 2017)(Steinberg and Landry
    2017; Turner 2015), and by extension the efficincy of the biogical
    pump (Cavan 2017)(Cavan et al. 2017).

        They consuming particles in surface depths and releasing at
        others zooplankton actively transport carbon (usually downward)
        (Steinberg et al., 2000; Hannides et al., 2009; Bianchi et al.,
        2013; Stukel et al., 2018b; Archibald et al., 2019;

      \setcounter{enumi}{2}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Zooplankton may consume particles in the mesopelegic and respire
        much of their biomass (Stukel et al.~2019)
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
      \setcounter{enumi}{3}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Zooplankton may break large partiles into smaller ones, through
        sloppy feeding (Cavin)(Cavan et al. 2017), or by generating
        turbulance that beraks downs particles (in Turner 2015
        -\textgreater{} Goldthwait et al.~2004)(Goldthwait et al. 2004),
        or part of a compex ``gardening'' (Mayor 2014).
      \end{enumerate}

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Fragmentation of particles can lead to increased
        remineralization of particles because those smaller particle
        pieces sink more slowly and so have longer residence times, and
        so have longer to breakd down in the mesopelegic (Goldthwait et
        al. 2005).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Oxygen levels, and in particular anoxic regions of the water column,
    appear to modulate particle flux through the mesopelegic

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Evidence

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Models (Cram, Devries and Weber, Bianchi and Weber)
      \item
        Observations: Arabian Sea (Kiel et al 2016). ETNP, closer to
        coast (Van Mooy et al.~2001).
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      This is important because oxygen minimum zones are expanding, and
      understanding their influence on ocean biogeochemistry is critical
      for understanding future oceans.
    \item
      Pelegic oxygen minimum zones are expanding(Stramma et al. 2008),
      and this expansion is likely to effect ocean chemistry, the
      habitat of marine organisms, and the interactions between between
      organisms and chemistry (Gilly et al. 2013). Models and chemical
      data suggest that oxygen minimum zones may enhance carbon
      transport to the deep ocean, by inhibiting microbial degredation
      of sinking marine particles (Cram et al. 2018). However, biologial
      organic mater transport is modulated by zooplankton (Steinberg et
      al. 2008; Steinberg and Landry 2017) which feed on, produce and
      disaggregate particles, and whose interactions on particle flux in
      pelegic OMZs are only beginning to be explored (Kiko et al. 2020).
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Particle size resolved models of TEFF in the oceans suggest that
    temperature, size and oxygen play a big role. (Cram et al.; Weber
    and DeVries)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      And regional differences in particle ballast plays a smaller role.
      (Cram et al.) -These models models assume that zooplankton play a
      small role, and therefore assume no transport through the
      mesopelegic, and no disaggregation. -They therefore predict
      attenuation of small particles and not large ones.
    \item
      A questionalbe assumption, given the established importance of
      zooplankton.
    \item
      However, These models particle size predictions generate a useful
      null hypothesis that can be compared against.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Particle data provide valuable information about particle transport.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      When performed in concert with traps, they can be used to predict
      flux in places where traps aren't. (Guidi) They can give resolved
      information about particle flux variability accross space and
      time. (Guidi, Kiko A)
    \item
      They can tell us about the relationship between particle size and
      sinking speed. (Guidi)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    A recent modeling study posed three hypotheses, each with a
    prediction about particle size distributions (Bianchi and Weber)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Bianchi and Weber proposed three reasons that this could occur

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Slower attenuation of \emph{all} particles: The rate of
        remineralizatoin of all particles could be slower in OMZs.
      \item
        Decreased disaggregation by zooplankton:
      \item
        Slower attenuation of large particles: Large particles might
        harbor cores that are limited in both oxygen and nitrate and so
        microbial metabolism could be unually slow in these.

        \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
        \item
          The authors proposed that these processes would have signature
          effects on particle size distribution in the core of the ETNP.
          Slower attenuation of all particles, was predicted to result
          in an increase in the abundance of small particles, while the
          other two models, would result in a decrease in small particle
          abundance as small particles were either not replaced by
          breakdown of large particles (model 2) or as those particles
          were broken down more quickly than larger particles (model 3).
          \emph{but} they didn't have data to determine which model was
          bestist.
        \end{itemize}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    A recent study combined particle size tracking, mockness tows,
    acoustic data, and trap measurments from the literature to explore
    zooplankton transport in a weak OmZ (Kiko B).
  \end{itemize}
\item

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Previous analyses of particles don't look directly at the particle
    size distribution slope
  \item
    TEFF models currently do not do a good job of predicting observed
    particle numbers
  \item
    There isn't much data about particle size throughout the ETNP OMZ.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      There isn't much data from oligotrophic, but very anoxic OMZs in
      general.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    There isn't much resoved temporal data, which makes it hard to
    deconvolve ongoing processes from temporal variability in particle
    production at the surface.
  \item
    Only one study to our knoledge combined measurments of traps,
    particles and acoustic data together

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      and none have traps at exactly the same time as the particle data.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    The data to test the Bianchi-Weber models didn't previously exist.
  \item
    Nobody has compared predictions of models to observed particle flux,
    and how those vary through the water column.
  \item
    Most OMZ are in the oligotrophic ocean, where productivity is low
    (REFs from clara). But most flux data has been measured in higher
    productivity regions (Van Mooy 2001)
  \end{itemize}
\item

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We targeted a site typical of the oligotrophic ETNP OMZ, well away
    from the high productivity zone in the coast.
  \item
    We collected particle size data at high temporal resolution over a
    week
  \item
    We compare it to observed flux measurments, and acoustic data.
  \item
    We describe particle size distrubtion slope.
  \item
    We test the Bianchi-Weber models.
  \item
    We quantify, thoughout the water column, how changes in size
    distribution deviate from changes that would be predicted by
    remineralization and sinking only models.
  \item
    Together, these analyses will provide more detailed informaiton
    about the relationship between particle transport and zooplankton in
    the ETNP OMZ.

  depth, and how does it vary over time?
\item
  Do our data support any of the Bianchi-Weber models?
\item
  Do our data suggest regions of the oxygen minimum zone with
  disaggregtion like processes, and if so do these co-occur with regions

\item
  Temporal day to day variability in paticle number, particles size

\item
  This variability would relate to the location of migratory
  zooplankton, with a combenation of increased particle flux and
  disaggregation present where zooplankton occur.

  Disaggregation and particle production by zooplankton might lead to

\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

Unless specified otherwise, measurments were taken on board the R/V
Sekuliaq from 07 January 2017 thorugh 13 January 2017 at 16.5°N 106.9°W,
located in an oligotrophic region of the Eastern Tropicla North Pacific
Oxygen Minimum Zone (Figure 1A). Data are compared against measurments
taken at 16.5°N 152.0°W on 08 May. A same latitude region west of the
OMZ, where oxygen is not limiting (Figure S\_).

\hypertarget{water-property-measurment}{%
\subsection{Water property measurment}\label{water-property-measurment}}

We measured water properties of temperature, salinity, fluorescence,
oxygen concentration and turbidity using the shipboard XXX CTD \{get
sensor information\}. Data were processed using seabird software and
analyzed and visualized in R.

\hypertarget{particle-size-measurments}{%
\subsection{Particle size measurments}\label{particle-size-measurments}}

Particle size data were collected by Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP)
that was mounted below the CTD-rosette and deployed for all CTD casts
shallower than 2500 m. A UVP is a combenation camera and light source
that describes the abundance and size of particles from 100 microns to
several centemeters in size (Picheral et al. 2010). Particles have been
previously shown to be primarely ``marine snow'' but may also include a
small number of zooplankton and visual artifacts. UVP data were
processed using custom matlab scripts, uploaded to EcoTaxa, and analyzed
in R.

\hypertarget{flux-measurments}{%
\subsection{Flux measurments}\label{flux-measurments}}

Particles were collected in incubating particle traps (\{Someone in
Ricks' lab -- what is a good reference for these?\}). Traps were used to
performincubation studies which will be reported elsewhere. As part of
these studies, the traps also generated data about carbon flux, which is
reportd here. Two types of traps were deployed. The particles were
collected in two kinds of traps. One set of traps, generally deployed in
shallower water had a solid cone opening with a cone opening with area
0.46 m\^{}2. The second set had larger conical net with opening of 1.23
m \^{}2 area made of 200 micron nylon mesh . In all cases particles
collected in the net or cone fell into one of two chambers. The
``plus-particles'' chamber collected particles from the net and
incubated them for an amount of time that ranged from X days to X days.
The top-collector trap collected particles, and then returned
immediately to the surface. We prferentially used data from the
``top-collector''; however in many cases, data was only available forom
the ``plus-particles'' trap, in which case we used that data.

\hypertarget{analysis}{%
\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

All analyses were constrained to the mesopelegic, defined here as the
region between the base of the photic zone and 1000m. For many analyses
particles were binned by depth with 20 m resolution between the surface
and 100m, 25 m resolution between 100m and 200 m depths and 50m
resolution between 200m and 1000m. To perform this binning, particle
numbers, and volumes of water sampled of each observation in the depth
region were summed prior to other analyses.

Two normalized values of particle numbers were calulated. In the first,
particle numbers were devided to volume sampled, to generate values in
particles/m\^{}3. IN

\hypertarget{particle-size-distribution}{%
\subsubsection{Particle size
distribution}\label{particle-size-distribution}}

We determined the slope and intercept of the particle size distribution
spectrum by fitting a power law to the data. Because large particles
were infrequently detected we used a poisson-general linear model that
considered the volume of paricles sampled, and particle bin-size and
that assumed that the residuals of the data followed a poisson (rather
than normal) distribution. Thus we fit the equation
\(log(\frac{E(Total\,Particles)}{Volume *Binsize}) = b_0 + b_1(Size)\)
to solve for the Intercept (\(b_0\)) and particle size distribution
slope (\(PSD = b_1\)). Where the term on the left describes the expected
volume and binsize normalized count data, assuming a negative binomial
distribution of residuals.

\hypertarget{estimating-particle-flux}{%
\subsubsection{Estimating particle
flux}\label{estimating-particle-flux}}

We estemated particle flux throughout the water column, by fitting
particle data to observed trap data. We assumed that particle flux in
each size bin (j) followed the equation

\[flux_j =  (\frac{Total\,Particles_j}{Volume * Binsize_i}) * C_f * (Size) ^ a\]
(Eqn 1.)

And where flux at a given depth is the sum of all bin specific values.
\[Flux = \sum_j{flux_j} \] (Eqn 2.)

We used r's built in optimization function to find the values of \(C_f\)
and \(a\) that yielded closest fits to each particle trap.

Assuming a spherical particle drag profile, it is possible to also
derrive the exponent of the particle size to biomass exponent \(\alpha\)
and size to sinking speed exponent \(\gamma\) as described in the
equations \(Biomass_j \sim Size_j^\alpha\) and
\(Speed_j \sim Size_j^\gamma\) (Guidi et al. 2008), following the
equations \(a = /alpha + /gamma\) and \(\gamma = \alpha -1\).

\hypertarget{size-specific-information}{%
\subsubsection{Size specific
information}\label{size-specific-information}}

We seperately analyzed total particle numbers, particle size
distribution, and particle flux for particles larger than or equal to
500 microns, and those smaller than 500 microns, to determine the
relative contributions of these two particle classes to particle
properties.

\hypertarget{variability}{%
\subsection{Variability}\label{variability}}

We used a general additive models, of form
\(Flux ~ s(Depth) + s(Day) + s(Hour)\) to expore whether estemated flux
levels appeared to vary by day and hour, holding the effects of depth
constant, in the XXX to XXX m region. The smooth terms \(s\) for depth
and day were thin plate splines, while the term for Hour was a cyclic
spline of 24 hour period.

\hypertarget{modeling-reminearalization-and-sinking}{%
\subsection{Modeling reminearalization and
sinking}\label{modeling-reminearalization-and-sinking}}

We modified the Particle Remineralization and Sinking (PRiSM) model, as
described by DeVries et al. (2014) to estemate particle size
distributions at each depth in the water column from (1) the particle
size distribution in the depth bin above, and (2) the estemated change
in flux between the two depths (which is itself calculated from the two
observed distributions) (Supplement). The model generates a predicted
profile at the deeper depth, which can be compared to the shallower
depth.

\hypertarget{physical-and-chemical-data}{%
\subsection{Physical and Chemical
Data}\label{physical-and-chemical-data}}

The anoxic zone, characterized by undetectable oxygen levels extends
from 80 m to 850 m depth, with a sharp upper oxycline and a gradual
lower oxycline (Figure 1B-D). The upper oxycline tracks a sharp
picnocline (Figure 1C 1D), characterized by a abrupt drop in temperature
below the mixed layer, and an increase in salinity (Figure 1B). The site
is characterized two fluorescence maxima (Figure 1C). The larger,
shallower fluorescence peak is positioned just above the oxycline,
ending exactly where oxygen reaches zero. The smaller, lower peak is
positioned entirely inside of the anoxic zone. Turbidity tracks the two
chlorophill peaks in the surface, and has a tertiary maximum at the
lower oxycline (Figure 1D).

\hypertarget{acoustic-data-reveal-diel-migration-patterns}{%
\subsection{Acoustic data reveal diel migration
patterns}\label{acoustic-data-reveal-diel-migration-patterns}}

Acoustic data, produced by the shipboard EK60 , suggest the presence of
multiple cohorts of migratory organisms. The largest organisms, observed
by backscattering of the EK60's 18000 Hz signal, showed the clearist
patterns. Most migratory organisms apppeared to leave the surface at
dawn and return at dusk, spending the day between 250 and 500m (Figure
2A). There appeared to be two local maxima in backscattering intensity
at mid-day, one at \textasciitilde{}300m and one at \textasciitilde{}375
m (Figure 2A). There also appeared to be organisms that migrated
downward at dusk and upward at dawn , spending the night at
\textasciitilde{}300m (Figure 2B). There was also a peak of organisms
that appeared, at mid-day, on some but not all days, without any visible
dawn or dusk migration just above the base of the photic zone. (Figure
2C). Other characteristics included what appeared to be diel migrators
that crossed the OMZ and spent the day below the range of the EK60
(Figure 2D), as well as organisms that appeared between 500m and 1000m
but did not appear to migrate to or from that depth at our site, but
rather simply transeted through the the EK60's field of view at that
time (Figure 2D).

Similar patterns were evident each other measured frequency, with better
resoultion by the lower frequencies (Figure S\_).

\hypertarget{flux-data}{%
\subsection{Flux data}\label{flux-data}}

Flux measurmenets at station P2 were consistant between the different
particle trap types and chambers measured, and showed a profile that
broadly represented a power law with respect to depth, with the
exception that flux appeared to increase in one trap at 500m. Four traps
in the surface had anomalously low measurments of flux, compared to
similar traps placed at similar depths, which may have been due to trap
malfunctions \{Talk to Jaqui about these\}.

the relationship between particle number and size suggested a power law
relationship where the log of volume and binsized normalized particle
abundance was proportional to the log of the particles size (Figure
S\_). The exception to this pattern was very large particles, which are
rare enough that they are usually not detected by the UVP. Generalized
linear models that assume a negative binomial distribution of the data
were able to account for this undersampling of large particles estemate
power log slopes, while taking into account rare occurances of the data,
at each depth (Figure S\_).

Total particle numbers were generally similar between different casts,
regardless of which day or hour they were collected (Figure S\_).
Particle numbers were highest in the surface and decreased rapidly,
flattened out over the 250 m to 500m range, decreased again untill the
lower oxycline, and then increased below the oxycline (Figure S\_).

The particle size distribution slope steepened (became more negative)
between the surface and 500m, flattened (became less negative) between
500m and 1000m, and then steepened again after 1000m (Figure X, S\_).
Steeper, more negative, slopes indicate a higher proportion of small
particles relative to large particles, while flatter, less negative,
slopes indicate a higher proportion of large particles relative to other
places.

\subsection{Estemated particle flux sometimes increases with depth in
the OMZ
core}\label{estemated-particle-flux-sometimes-increases-with-depth-in-the-omz-core}}

Using an optimization algorithm, we found that there was greatist
agreement between estimates of trap observed particle flux, and UVP
estemated particle flux when the particle size to flux relationship was
goverened by the ratio \[Flux = 133 * Size ^ {2.00}\]. This resulted in
a UVP predicted flux profile that broadly fit the expected trap observed
flux profiles, excluding the four traps that were held out from the
analysis due to low abundance.

Particle flux profiles varied notably between casts between the base the
photic zone and 100 and 500m m (Figure 4a-b). Between 250 m and 500 m
particle flux appeared to increase on some but not all casts, while
attenuating slowly on others (Figure 4c). Below 500m, there were not
enough casts to measure variability between casts.

General aditive models that examined the rate of change of flux between
250 and 500m found that, after removing the effect of depth, there was a
statisticlaly significant relationship between day of the week and the
fifth-root transformed, rate of change of flux (P = 0.002), as well as
between hour of the day and flux (P = 0.040). There were increases in
flux over this region towards the beginning and end of the sampling
period, and lowist near day 10. There was also increases in flux in the
daytime but decreases at night-time. By comparing three general additive
models, one that considered only depth, one that considered depth and
day of the week and on that considered depth, day of week, and time of
day, we found that while depth accounted for 37\% of the variance,
adding day of the week accounted for an additional 18\% of the variance,
and hour of the day accounted for only 8.7\% of the remaining variance
in transformed rate of change of flux. If the fifth root transformation
was not applied to the rate of change of flux, the hourly pattern was
not evident. Increases in flux in this region were clearly not limited
to the daytime, as one midnight cast showed increases here as well
(Figure 4C).

\{I need to add these supplemental figures\}. \#\#\# Oxic Region:
Chemistry The oxic site was characterized by a more gradually
picnocline, and an oxygen minimum at 500m that was not fully anoxic. The
photic zone characterized by a single fluorecence peak with a maximum at
110m and which disapeared at 200m. Turbidity followed chlorophyl and did
not have a deep peak. There was a salinity peak at 150m.

\subsubsection{Oxic Region: Particle Number and

With the exception of the surface, where particle numbers were similar
between the two sites, particle numbers were higher throughout the top
1000m of the water column at the ETNP site, than at the same-latitude,
oxygenic P16 station 100. Particle size distributions were similar
between the two sites above 500m, being characterized by overlapping
confedence intervals by generated by a general additive model. From 500
to 1000m, particle size distributions were steeper at the ETNP
site,being characterized by a higher proportion of small particles
(Figure S5).

\hypertarget{oxic-region-large-vs-small-particles}{%
\subsubsection{Oxic Region: Large vs small
particles}\label{oxic-region-large-vs-small-particles}}

Small particles (100um - 500 um) at our site were about two orders of
magnitude more common than large particles (\textgreater{}= 500um). The
number of large particle numbers appeared to attenuate more quickly than
small particles, and more genearally follow a power law decrease, while
small particles appeared to increase around 500m (Figure S\_). Flux was
predicted to be predominantly from small, rather than large particles,
at all depths except the very surface. The particle size distribution,
calculated only on large particles, was more variable between depths
than calculated for small particles. Data from the oxic P16 station 100
suggested more particles, steeper particle size distribution, and more
flux than at this station than at the ETNP station. They also sugested
that differences between large and small particles, with respect to
number, flux and size distribution that were broadly similar to the ones
seen at ETNP staion P2 (Figure S\_).

Flux at P16 Station 100 appeared to attenuate following a power law from

\hypertarget{smoothed-and-averaged-data}{%
\subsection{Smoothed and averaged
data}\label{smoothed-and-averaged-data}}

Highly smoothed particle data suggestd that particle size, averaged
accross all casts, followed a pattern in which the abundance of small
particles increased in the OMZ surface (Figure 5A), which corresponded
with characterized by steepening of the particle size distribution (5A),
an incrrease in small particle biomass (5B), but not of large particle
biomass (5C). Deeper in the OMZ the small particle number, PSD slope,
and biomass of small particles declined.

\hypertarget{particle-number-dynamics-differ-from-model-expectations}{%
\subsection{Particle number dynamics differ from model
expectations}\label{particle-number-dynamics-differ-from-model-expectations}}

We were able to use our modified particle remineralization and sinking
model to predict particle size distributions at each depth from the
particle size distribution at depth one depth-bin shallower and the
calculated flux attenuation between the two depths. We found that the
observed particle size distributions usually varied from model
expectations (Figure S\_ \{An example\}). Tautologiclly, at each depth,
the observed size profile and the model predicted size profiles have
same flux. However, the difference between the flux of observed and
predicted \emph{small particles} (100-500), normalized to depth, serves
as a valuable metric of patterns of deviations from modeled results. We
call this value \emph{OSMS} (\textbf{O}bserved \textbf{S}mall Flux Finus
\textbf{M}odeled \textbf{S}mall Flux).

\[ OSMS = \frac{(Small\,Flux\,Observed - Small\,Flux\,Modeled)}{\Delta Z}\]

\begin{equation}
OSMS = \frac{(Small\,Flux\,Observed - Small\,Flux\,Modeled)}{\Delta Z}
\end{equation}

In the above equation \(\Delta Z\) is the distance, in meters between
the current depth, and the depth for which the particle size
distribution and flux change since, inform the model.

OSMS was positive between the photic zone and 500m, meaning that less
small flux attenuated than would be expected from the PRiSM model in
this region. There was some variability in the OSMS parameter between
casts. A general additive model, after factoring out the effect of
depth, found that there was a statistically significant relationship
between day of the cast and OSMS with highest values near day 10 of the
study (which is when flux attenuation in this region was lowest)
(\emph{p}=0.01). However there was not a statistically significant
relationship between hour of the day and OSMS.

Below 500m, OSMS was negative. There were only two casts that reached
below 500m at this station, and so an analysis of the dynamics of OSMS
in this region are not possible.

At P16 Station 100, OSMS was positive between the base of the photic
zone and 350m and negative below 350m (Figure S\_).

\hypertarget{diel-migrators-spend-time-in-the-omz-core}{%
\subsection{Diel migrators spend time in the OMZ
core}\label{diel-migrators-spend-time-in-the-omz-core}}

Organisms of all sizes appear to migrate into the core of the OMZ. Most
in the day (Figure 2A), and some at night (Figure 2B). This migratory
behavior has been seen elsewhere (ref), including OMZs. One hypothesis
is that the OMZ provides protection from predators of all sizes (ref).
Other studies with that have have characterized the diurnal and
nocturnal orgnaisms found in the OMZ, though not at this exact site. In
the XXX, maas et al saw decapods and stuff \{reread that paper and find
others\}. At the size range seen by the 18000 kHz band, humboldt and
market squid are known to be tolarant to anoxia and to migrate into the
OMZ to hunt. These small organisms likely have the greatist effect on
particle transport (ref) and disaggregation (ref). Diel migration
patterns are common in the ocean (ref) and zooplankton transport of
particles have been indicated in other enviornments (ref).

The acoustic data suggests the presence of some other interesting
migratory patterns. The organisms that appear between 500m and 1000m may
be jellyfish (ref). The horizontal bands seen here could indicate the
presence of swarms of jellyfish that migrate through the field of view
of the EK60. These organsisms do not seem to have much of an effect on
particle size.

somewhere\}.}\label{flux-is-lower-at-this-site-than-previous-measurments-in-the-etnp-unless-megan-duffy-is-going-to-have-already-said-this-somewhere.}}

Flux here is lower at all depths than seen in previous measurments by
traps in the OMZ (Ref). This seems reasonable, because the previous
measurments were taken nearer to the coast, where surface chlorphyl is
higher (Figure 1A).

\hypertarget{the-flux-to-size-relationship-is-typical-of-other-sites.}{%
\subsection{The flux to size relationship is typical of other
sites.}\label{the-flux-to-size-relationship-is-typical-of-other-sites.}}

The exponent (a) of the particle size to flux relationship (Eqn X) that
we saw at our site 2.00, is of a similar magnitude to those seen by
other studies that compare UVP flux to traps (Guidi, Kiko). It is not
identical to these measurments. This could be because these values vary
between sites, or that imprecision in flux measurments leads to
differences in these values between studies. Indeed, we found this value
was sensitive to outlying data points.

If we left in the four traps that measured very little flux in the
surface, we instead got values for this size relationship that
approached zero. We feel confedent excluding these traps, because it was
standard for traps to under-measure flux \{and maybe there were actually
things observed about these\}, and because we have traps at very similar
depths over the same time window that provided substantially higher
results. Because we have found that traps appear to under-measure flux
when they fail, rather than over measure it, we have gone with the
higher measurements.

\subsection{Remineralization rates of all particles decrease in the OMZ,
but disaggregation does
not}\label{remineralization-rates-of-all-particles-decrease-in-the-omz-but-disaggregation-does-not}}

Particle size profiles, particle size distribution slopes, and estemated
biovolume, averaged accross all casts and smoothed, are all similar to
the predictions made by Weber and Bianchi's (YYY) ``Model 1''. (Figure
4). This suggests that the low oxygen at this site decreases the
particle remineralization rate of all particles, including small ones.
It does not support the Weber-Bianchi Model 2 in which remineralization
is suppressed in the OMZ, nor their model 3 in which only the very large
particles' remineralization is slowed.

\subsection{Zooplankton likely transport organic mater into the OMZ
core.}\label{zooplankton-likely-transport-organic-mater-into-the-omz-core.}}

Predicted flux levels sometimes increase between XXX and XXX meters, and
at all time attenuate very slowly in this region. The EK60 data suggest
diel migration of organimss of all sizes to ths same region. Taken
together, this increase in flux concurent diel migration, suggest
transport of organic mater by zooplankton. Zooplankton may consume
organic matter in the day and then release it at night (REF). That the
flux varies between days suggests some day to day variability in this
transport. That it is highest in the day, on average, suggests that the
diel migrators may be contributing to this flux, but the fact that this
diel variability is small compared to overall variability suggests that
other processes may modulate this rate, and that noctural migrators may
also play a role in carbon transport.

\hypertarget{zooplankton-likely-disaggregate-particles-in-the-omz-core.}{%
\subsection{Zooplankton likely disaggregate particles in the OMZ
core.}\label{zooplankton-likely-disaggregate-particles-in-the-omz-core.}}

The observation that there is more small flux that would be predicted by
remineralization and sinking between the photic zone and 500m suggests
that some process is disaggregating large particles into smaller ones.
That this corresponds with the region where migratory organsims are
found suggests that some of these organsisms, likely zooplankton
including copepods (ref), may be breaking down particles through
``sloppy feeding'' in which organisms attack particles and break them
into smaller pieces (ref). Alternatively, other processes such as rapid
spontanious or microbial breakdown of zooplankton transported particles,
or of flux from the surface, could also be responsible of this increase
in small particle flux (ref).

Other deviations from model assumptions could also explain the increase
in small particles over model predictions For instance, if the models
assumed relationship between size, flux, sinking speed and biomass are
not all accurate, particle dynamics would also differ. For instance, if
remineralization differed between particle types, with small particles
breking down more slowly than larger ones, perhaps because they are more
labile, we might see the same kind of deviation from the model. If small
particles sank more quickly for their size than expected, as has been
seen elsewhere \{Mcdonnell\}, a similar deviation would occur as they
would have less time to remineralize per depth.

Our model also assumes a spherical paricle drag profile, such that the
particle sinking speed fractal dimension (gamma) is one less than the
particcal size fractal dimension (alpha), and that these two values sum
to the particle flux fractal dimension. If any of these assumptions do
not hold, or even if our calculation of the particle flux fractal
dimension was in error, the magnitude of the values may differ.

Furthermore, since flux varies over time, that variability could
contribute to these values, and we haven't yet deconvoluted these
processes, but future models could leverage time series data like this
one to incorperate multiple observed time-points into the prediction of
particle size distributions at depth. One way to do this would be to use
a smoothing function to interpolte particle abundances at each size,
depth and times, and then to use a model in which the sinking speed of a
given particle size is used to identify the relevant time-point where
the abudance informs that time-point.

The opposite pattern to that seen at shallower depths occures below
500m, with apparent flattening of the particle size distribution. This
could suggest aggregation occurs here, though given the sparsity of
particles, we don't see a mechanism for this process. More likely is
that particles do follow PRiSM like processes in this region but that
likely one of our parameters are off and so disaggregation is actually
higher than shown in this figure.
