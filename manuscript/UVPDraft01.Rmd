# Abstract

Models and observations suggest that that particle flux attenuation is lower across the mesopelagic zone of anoxic environments compared to oxic ones. This attenuation is likely a function of microbial metabolism, as well as aggregation and disaggregation by zooplankton and other processes. The concentration of different sizes of particles in the ocean, called the particle specum, is shaped by particle aggregation, disaggregation and remineralization processes. Observing and modeling particle spectra can provide information about the contributions of these processes. We measured particle size spectrum profiles at one station in the oligotrophic Eastern Tropical North Pacific Oxygen Minimum Zone (ETNP OMZ) using an underwater vision profiler (UVP), a high resolution camera that counts and sizes particles. Measurements were taken at different times of day, over the course of a week. Comparing these data to particle flux measurements from sediment traps collecting during the same time period allowed us to constrain the particle size to flux relationship, and to generate highly resolved depth and time estimates of particle flux rates. We found that particle flux attenuated very little throughout the anoxic water column, and at some time-points appeared to increase. Our data suggest that particles of all sizes remineralize more slowly in the OMZ than in oxic waters, and that large particles disaggregate into smaller ones particles between the base of the photic zone and 500m. Acoustic measurements of multiple size classes of organisms suggested that many organisms migrated, during the day, to this region with high disaggregation. Our data suggest that migrating organisms both actively transport biomass and disaggregate particles in the OMZ core. Our data further suggest both within and between day variability in active transport and particle disaggregation.


# Introduction

The biological pump, in which sinking particles transport carbon from the surface into the deep ocean, is a key part of the global carbon cycle  [@neuerOceanBiologicalCarbon2014; @turnerZooplanktonFecalPellets2015]. Organic matter flux into the deep ocean is a function both of export from the photic zone into the mesopelegic (export flux), and the fraction of that flux that crosses the mesopelegic (transfer efficiency) [@passowBiologicalPumpHigh2012; @siegelPredictionExportFate2016; @francoisFactorsControllingFlux2002]. The transfer efficiency of the biological pump, may affect global atmospheric carbon levels [@kwonImpactRemineralizationDepth2009]. Thus understanding the processes that shape organic matter degredation in the mesopelegic are critical.

Zooplankton play an important role in shaping carbon flux through the mesopelegic [@steinbergZooplanktonOceanCarbon2017; @turnerZooplanktonFecalPellets2015; @jacksonModelDistributionParticle2001], and by extension the efficiency of the biological pump [@cavanRoleZooplanktonDetermining2017; @archibaldModelingImpactZooplankton2019]. They affect particle flux through *repackaging*, *respiration*, *active transport* and *disaggregation*. Zooplankton *repackage* particles into fecal pellets that have different properties from the original particles [@wilsonChangesFecalPellet2008]. Zooplankton consume particles in the mesopelegic and *respire* some of their biomass. It was found that this rate of consumption did not substantially attenuate flux in the California Current [@stukelRolesSuspensionFeedingFluxFeeding2019]. Zooplankton consume particles in surface depths and release it at others, thereby *actively transporting* carbon, usually downward [@archibaldModelingImpactZooplankton2019; @bianchiIntensificationOpenoceanOxygen2013; @hannidesExportStoichiometryMigrantmediated2009; @steinbergZooplanktonVerticalMigration2000; @stukelNitrogenIsotopeFlows2018; @stukelRolesSuspensionFeedingFluxFeeding2019]. Zooplankton  break large particles into smaller ones, likely by generating turbulance when they swim [@dillingFragmentationMarineSnow2000; @goldthwaitEffectsPhysicalFragmentation2005]. This *disaggregation* can lead to increased remineralization of particles because those smaller particle pieces sink more slowly and so have longer residence timesin the mesopelagic, causing them to be consumed before reaching deep waters [@goldthwaitEffectsPhysicalFragmentation2005]. In this manuscript we focus on active transport and disagggregation in particular.
      
Oxygen levels, and in particular anoxic regions of the water column, appear to modulate particle flux through the mesopelegic.  Observations of particle flux in the region of the Easten Tropical North Pacific [@vanmooyImpactSuboxiaSinking2002; @hartnettOrganicCarbonInput1998] that is near the Mexican coast, and Arabian Sea [@keilMultiproxyApproachUnderstanding2016] have suggested lower flux attenuation in these OMZ systems. Models have shown that accounting for oxygen limitation in OMZs is necessary to fit global patterns of particle transfer [@cramRoleParticleSize2018; @devriesExportFateOrganic2017; @paviaShallowParticulateOrganic2019]. Oxygen minimum zones in the open ocean, including the ETNP, are expanding [@strammaExpandingOxygenMinimumZones2008; @horakExpansionDenitrificationAnoxia2016], and this expansion is likely to effect ocean chemistry, the habitat of marine organisms, and the interactions between between organisms and chemistry [@gillyOceanographicBiologicalEffects2013]. Models and chemical data suggest that oxygen minimum zones may enhance carbon transport to the deep ocean, by inhibiting microbial degradation of sinking marine particles [@cramRoleParticleSize2018]. However, biological organic mater transport is modulated by zooplankton [@steinbergBacterialVsZooplankton2008; @steinbergZooplanktonOceanCarbon2017]  which feed on, produce and disaggregate particles, and whose interactions on particle flux in pelagic OMZs are only beginning to be explored [@kikoZooplanktonMediatedFluxesEastern2020].

Models of particle transfer through the mesopelegic oceans suggest that particle size, ocean temperature, and oxygen concentrations modulate particle flux [@cramRoleParticleSize2018; @devriesExportFateOrganic2017]. Meanwhile regional differences in particle ballasting play a smaller role. [@cramRoleParticleSize2018]. These models, however, assume that zooplankton play a small role, and therefore assume no transport through the mesopelegic, and no disaggregation. As a result of this assumption, the models predict that small particles will attenuate with depth. However small particles have been shown to persist in deep waters (REF) and contribute substantially to flux in the deep ocean (REF {I've seen this somewhere but am having trouble finding the reference}). Conveniently, these models' particle size predictions generate a useful null hypothesis of expexted particle size distributions in the abscence of zooplankton effects. Thus their predictions can, in principle, be compared to observed distributions of particles to explore the magnitude of zooplankton effects.
           
Underwater vision profilers, cameras that can count and size many particles over large water volumes [@picheralUnderwaterVisionProfiler2010], provide valuable information about particle transport. When deployed in concert with particle traps in some regions, they can be used to predict flux in other regions where traps have not been deployed [@guidiRelationshipParticleSize2008; @kikoZooplanktonMediatedFluxesEastern2020]. UVP can furthermore provide resolved information about particle flux variability across space and time [@guidiRelationshipParticleSize2008; @kikoBiologicalPhysicalInfluences2017]. Connecting UVP and trap data can furthermore inform about relationships between particle size, biomass, and sinking speed, as well as the contributions of the different particle sizes to flux [@guidiRelationshipParticleSize2008].
          
A recent study combined particle size tracking, mockness tows, and acoustic data, collected at one site, with trap measurements from nearby locations, from the literature, to explore zooplankton transport in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic, a weak (hypoxic rather than fully anoxic) OMZ [@kikoZooplanktonMediatedFluxesEastern2020]. The authors found a particle maximum in the mesopelegic and contended that this feature suggests transport by zooplankton, and mortality of migrating zooplankton. The authors suggest that in more anoxic and larger OMZs, such as the modern day ETNP, and in particular or OMZs in the future, there might be less active transport into the mesopelegic than seen at their site, since migratory organisms would presumably not migrate as deeply into the water and would be less active in true OMZs. In this manuscript we provide data from such a truly anoxic region.
     
A recent modeling study poses three hypotheses, each with a prediction about particle size distributions [@weberEfficientParticleTransfer2020]. These are: **HWB1:** *All* particles in OMZs remineralize more slowly than in oxic water, regardless of their size. **HWB2:** There is less disaggregation by zooplankton in OMZs than elsewhere. **HWB3:** Large particles remineralize more slowly in OMZs, but smaller ones do not. This last hypothesis was indicated by model results that suggest that large particles are diffusion limited. Therefore, microbial metabolism in their cores could also be limited by nitrate and nitrite, even though both elements are present in the OMZ core. In that case less efficient sulfate processes would dominate [@bianchiGlobalNicheMarine2018]. Microbial analysis of particles did find sulfate reducers, but not in abundance [@saundersCompleteArsenicbasedRespiratory2019]. The authors propose that the processes undelying each hypothesis would have signature effects on particle size distribution in the core of the ETNP. The model with slow attenuation of all particles, predicts an increase in the abundance of small particles, while the other two models, predict a decrease in small particle abundance, because small particles are either not replaced by disaggregaton of large particles (Model 2) or because those particles are remineralized more quickly than larger particles (Model 3). However, the authors were not able to support any hypothesis at the exclusion of the others because they did not have the necessary data about particle size. In this manuscript we present data that can test these three hypotheses.

While UVP and traps have been sampled together [@guidiRelationshipParticleSize2008], combined trap and UVP measurments have not been taken together previously in an OMZ. Globally, most of the volume of the ETNP OMZ is below regions of very low surface productivity [@fuchsmanCyanobacteriaCyanophageContributions2019; @penningtonPrimaryProductionEastern2006]. Meanwhile most flux data has been measured in higher productivity regions of the ETNP [@vanmooyImpactSuboxiaSinking2002; @hartnettOrganicCarbonInput1998]. Furthermore, the degree to which zooplankton swimming or other processes lead to particle disaggregation, both in OMZs and elsewhere in the ocean, is unknown.

To provide the data to test hypotheses and illuminate zooplankton particle interactions in oligotrophic OMZs, we collected particle size data at high temporal resolution over the course of a week in an anoxic site typical of the oligotrophic ETNP OMZ, well away from the high productivity zone in the coast. We integrated this size data with observed flux measurements, and acoustic data. We quantified, throughout the water column, how changes in size distribution deviate from changes that would be predicted by remineralization and sinking only models.

We ask the following three questions: **A:** How do the particle size distribution at one location in the oligotrophic Eastern Tropical North Pacific vary with respect to depth and time? **B:** Do our data support any of the three Weber and Bianchi [-@weberEfficientParticleTransfer2020] models? **C:** Do our data suggest regions of the oxygen minimum zone with disaggregation like processes, and if so, do these co-occur with regions suggested to harbor zooplankton.

We hypothesized **H1:** Temporal day to day variability in particle number, particle size distribution slope and flux would be evident. **H2:** This variability would relate to the location of migratory zooplankton, with a combination of increased particle flux and disaggregation present where zooplankton occur. **H3:** Disaggregation and particle production by zooplankton might lead to particle size patterns that cannot be explained by remineralization and sinking alone. We also will test each of the three Weber-Bianchi models, specifically that OMZs have (**HWB1**) slower attenuation of all particles, (**HWB2**) decreased disaggregation, or (**HWB3**) slower attenuation of just large particles, in the OMZ core.

 
# Methods
Unless specified otherwise, measurements were taken on board the R/V Sikuliaq from 07 January 2017 through 13 January 2017 at 16.5°N 106.9°W, located in an oligotrophic region of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific Oxygen Minimum Zone (ETNP Station P2; Figure 1A). Data are compared against measurements taken at 16.5°N 152.0°W on 08 May, collected on the GO-SHIP CLIVAR/CARBON P16N Leg 1 Cruise (CCHDO Hydrographic Cruise 33RO20150410). This station was at the same latitude as ETNP Station P2,  west of the OMZ, where oxygen is not limiting (P16 Transect Station 100; Figure S1). 

## Water property measurement
We measured water properties of temperature, salinity, fluorescence, oxygen concentration and turbidity using the shipboard XXX CTD {get sensor information}. Data were processed using Seabird Software and analyzed and visualized in *R*.

## Particle size measurements
Particle size data were collected by Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP) that was mounted below the CTD-rosette and deployed for all CTD casts shallower than 2500 m. A UVP is a combination camera and light source that describes the abundance and size of particles from $100 \mu m$ to several centimeters in size [@picheralUnderwaterVisionProfiler2010]. Particles have been previously shown to be primarily "marine snow" but may also include a small number of zooplankton and visual artifacts. UVP data were processed using custom MATLAB scripts, uploaded to EcoTaxa [@picheralEcoTaxaToolTaxonomic], and analyzed in R. The UVP provided estimates of particle abundances of particles in different size-bins, as well as information about the volumes over which those particle numbers had been collected.

## Flux measurements

Particles were collected in free floating, surface tethered, particle . Traps  were modified to perform incubations which will be reported elsewhere.  As part of these studies, the traps also generated data about carbon flux, which is reported here. Two types of traps were deployed. One set of traps, generally deployed in shallower water, had a solid cone opening with area $0.46m^2$. The second set had larger conical net with opening of $1.23m^2$ area made of $200\mu m$ nylon mesh. In all cases, particles collected in the net or cone fell into one of two chambers. The “plus-particles” chamber collected particles from the net and incubated them for approximately 22 hours. The top-collector trap collected particles, and then returned immediately to the surface. We preferentially used data from the “top-collector”. However, in , the trap at 73 meters malfunctioned and data was only available from the “plus-particles” trap, which we used instead. Carbon content of particles in each trap was measured by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry failed to detect any carbon in four surface traps, which were excluded from the analysis. Traps at similar depths did detect carbon, lending confidence to the idea that these non-detections were technical in nature, rather than reflecting environmental conditions.


## Analysis
All analyses were constrained to the mesopelegic, defined here as the region between the base of the photic zone (175 m), whihc is below the oxycline, and 1000 m. For many analyses particles were binned by depth with 20 m resolution between the surface and 100 m, 25 m resolution between 100m and 200 m depths and 50m resolution between 200m and  1000m. To perform this binning, particle numbers, and volumes of water sampled of all observations within each depth bin were summed prior to other analyses.

Two normalized values of particle numbers were calculated. In the first, particle numbers were divided by volume sampled, to generate values in $particles/m^3$. In the second, particles were divided by both volume sampled and the width of the particle size-bins to generate values in $particles/m^3/mm$.

### Particle size distribution

 We determined the slope and intercept of the particle size distribution spectrum by fitting a power law to the data. Because large particles were infrequently detected we used a negative-bionomial general linear model that considered the volume of particles sampled, and particle bin-size and that assumed that the residuals of the data followed a negative-bionomial (rather than normal) distribution. Thus we fit the equation $ln(\frac{E(Total\,Particles)}{Volume *Binsize}) = b_0 + b_1\,ln(Size)$ to solve for the Intercept ($b_0$) and particle size distribution slope ($PSD = b_1$). Where the term on the left describes the expected volume and bin-size normalized count data, assuming a negative binomial distribution of residuals.
 
### Estimating particle flux

We estimated particle flux throughout the water column, by fitting particle data to trap measurments. We assumed that particle flux in each size bin (j) followed the equation

$$flux_j =  (\frac{Total\,Particles_j}{Volume * Binsize_i}) * C_f * (Size) ^ a $$ 
(Eqn 1.)

And where flux at a given depth is the sum of all bin specific values.
$$Flux = \sum_j{flux_j}$$ 
(Eqn 2.)

We used the `optimize()` function *R*'s `stats` package to find the values of $C_f$ and $a$ that yielded closest fits of the UVP estimated flux to each particle trap.

We also estimated the exponent of the particle size to biomass exponent $\alpha$  and size to sinking speed exponent $\gamma$ per the equations $Biomass_j \sim Size_j^\alpha$ and $Speed_j \sim Size_j^\gamma$. This is done by assuming a sperical drag profle, in which case $a = \alpha + \gamma$ and $\gamma = \alpha -1$ [@guidiRelationshipParticleSize2008].

### Size specific information

We separately analyzed total particle numbers, particle size distribution, and particle flux for particles larger than or equal to $500 \mu m$, and those smaller than $500 \mu m$, to determine the relative contributions of these two particle classes to particle properties.

## Variability
We used a general additive model, of form $Flux \sim s(Depth) + s(Day) + s(Hour)$ to explore whether estimated flux levels appeared to vary by day and hour, holding the effects of depth constant, in the 250 m to 500 m region. The smooth terms *s* for "Depth" and "Day" were  thin plate splines, while the *s* term for "Hour" was a cyclic spline of 24 hour period.

## Modeling remineralization and sinking
We modified the Particle Remineralization and Sinking (PRiSM) model, as described by DeVries et al. [-@devriesMechanisticParticleFlux2014] to estimate particle size distributions at each depth in the water column from (1) the particle size distribution in the depth bin above, and (2) the estimated change in flux between the two depths (which is itself calculated from the two observed distributions) (Supplement). The model generates a predicted profile at the deeper depth, which can be compared to the shallower depth.


# Results

## Physical and Chemical Data
The anoxic zone, characterized by undetectable oxygen levels, extends from 80 m to 850 m depth, with a sharp upper oxycline and a gradual lower oxycline (Figure 1B-D). The upper oxycline tracks a sharp picnocline (Figure 1C-1D), characterized by a abrupt drop in temperature below the mixed layer, and an increase in salinity (Figure 1B).  The site is characterized two fluorescence maxima (Figure 1C). The larger, shallower fluorescence peak is positioned just above the oxycline, ending exactly where oxygen reaches zero. The smaller, lower peak is positioned entirely inside of the anoxic zone. Turbidity tracks the two chlorophyll peaks in the surface, and has a tertiary maximum at the lower oxycline (Figure 1D).

## Acoustic data reveal diel migration patterns

Acoustic data, produced by the shipboard EK60 [@andersenNewSimradEK602001], suggest the presence of multiple cohorts of migratory organisms. We focus initially on  backscattering measurments from the EK60's lowist frequency 18000 Hz signal, because it travels furthest into the water column and has the best resolution of the channels. Most migratory organisms appeared to leave the surface at dawn and return at dusk, spending the day between 250 and 500m (Figure 2A). There appeared to be two local maxima in backscattering intensity at mid-day, one at ~300m and one at ~375 m (Figure 2A). There also appeared to be organisms that migrated downward at dusk and upward at dawn , spending the night at ~300m (Figure 2B). There was also a peak of organisms that appeared, at mid-day, on some but not all days, without any visible dawn or dusk migration just above the base of the photic zone. (Figure 2C). Some diel migrators appeared to cross the OMZ and spend the day below the detection range of the EK60 (Figure 2D), as well as organisms that appeared between 500m and 1000m but did not appear to migrate to or from that depth at our site, but rather traveled through the the EK60's field of view (Figure 2D). 

Similar patterns were evident each other measured frequency, with better resolution by the lower frequencies (Figure S2). 

## Flux data from traps
Flux measurements at station P2 were consistent between the different particle trap types, showing a profile that broadly followed a power law with respect to depth, with the exception that flux appeared to increase in one trap at 500m (Figure 3).

## Particle abundance measurements vary with size and depth
In all profiles, particle abundances were highest at the surface, and highest among the smallest particles (Figure S3). Visual examination of the relationship between particle number and size suggested a power law relationship where the log of volume and bin-sized normalized particle abundance was proportional to the log of the particles' size (Figure S4). The exception to this pattern were particles larger than 10mm (Figure S3), which are rare enough that they are usually not detected by the UVP. Generalized linear models that assume a negative-binomial distribution of the data were able to account for this under-sampling of large particles to estimate power law slopes, while considering rare occurrences of the large particles at each depth (Figure S4). 

Total particle numbers were generally similar between different casts, regardless of which day or hour they were collected (Figure 4A). Particle numbers were highest in the surface and decreased rapidly, flattened out over the 250 m to 500m range, decreased again until the lower oxycline, and then increased below the oxycline (Figure 4A). 


The particle size distribution slope steepened (became more negative) between the surface and 500m, flattened (became less negative) between 500m and 1000m, and then steepened again after 1000m (Figure 4B). Steeper, more negative, slopes indicate a higher proportion of small particles relative to large particles, while flatter, less negative, slopes indicate a higher proportion of large particles.

## Estimated particle flux sometimes increases with depth in the OMZ core
Our optimization approach suggested that there was greatest agreement between estimates of trap observed particle flux, and UVP estimated particle flux when the particle size to flux relationship was governed by the ratio $Flux = 133 * Size ^ {2.00}$. Applying this fit to the UVP data resulted in a UVP predicted flux profile that broadly fit the expected trap observed flux profiles.

Particle flux profiles varied notably between casts between the base the photic zone and 500 m (Figure 5A-5B). Between 250 m and 500 m particle flux appeared to increase on some, but not all, casts, while attenuating slowly on the other casts (Figure 4C). Below 500 m, there were not enough casts to measure variability between casts.

General additive models that examined the rate of change of flux between 250 and 500m found that, after removing the effect of depth, there was a statistically significant relationship between day of the week and the fifth-root transformed, rate of change of flux (*p* = 0.002), as well as between hour of the day and flux (*p* = 0.040) (Figure S5). There were increases in flux over this region  towards the beginning and end of the sampling period, and lowest near day 10. There was also increases in flux in the daytime relative to night-time. By comparing three general additive models, one that considered only depth, one that considered depth and day of the week, and on that considered depth, day of week, and time of day, we found that  depth accounted for 37% of the variance, adding day of the week accounted for an additional 18% of the variance, and hour of the day accounted for 8.7% of the remaining variance in transformed rate of change of flux. If the fifth root transformation was not applied to the rate of change of flux, the hourly pattern was not evident. Increases in flux in this region were clearly not limited to the daytime, as one midnight cast showed increases here as well (Figure 5C).

## ETNP particle dynamics differ from those seen at an oxic site

The oxic site, P16 Station 100, was characterized by a more gradually sloping picnocline, and an oxygen minimum at 500m of 19.7 $\mu$M, which is not anoxic (Figure S1B). The photic zone is characterized by a single fluorescence peak with a maximum at 110m and which disappeared at 200m (Figure S1C). Turbidity followed chlorophyll concentration and did not have a peak in the mesopelegic (Figure S1D), unlike the OMZ site. There was a salinity peak at 150m (Figure S1B).

Particle numbers were higher, between the base of the photic zone through 1000 m at the ETNP OMZ site, than at the same-latitude, oxygenic P16 station 100 (Figure S6A). Particle size distributions were similar between the two sites above 500m, being characterized by overlapping confidence intervals by generated by a general additive model. From 500 to 1000m, particle size distributions were  steeper at the ETNP site,being characterized by a higher proportion of small particles (Figure S6B). 

Small particles (100 $\mu$m - 500 $\mu$m) at the ETNP OMZ site were about two orders of magnitude more common than large particles (>= 500 $\mu$m) (Figure S7). Large particle numbers appeared to attenuate more quickly than small particles, and more generally follow a power law decrease, while small particles appeared to increase around 500 m. Flux was predicted to be predominantly from small, rather than large particles, at all depths except the very surface. The particle size distribution, calculated only on large particles, was more variable between depths than calculated for small particles. Data from the oxic P16 station 100 suggested more particles, steeper particle size distribution, and more flux than at this station than at the ETNP station. They also suggested that differences between large and small particles, with respect to number, flux and size distribution that were broadly similar to the ones seen at ETNP Station P2.

In contrast to the anoxic station, at the oxic station, flux always decreased with depth (Figure S8A+B).


## Smoothed and averaged data
Highly smoothed particle data suggested that particle size, averaged across all casts, followed a pattern in which the abundance of small particles increased between the oxycline and 500 m (Figure 6A), which corresponded with steepening of the particle size distribution (Figure 6A), an increase in small particle biomass (Figure 6B), but not of large particle biomass (Figure 6C). Deeper in the OMZ, the small particle number, particle size distribution slope, and biomass of small particles declined. At the oxic site, particle size distributions generally steepended with depth, while both small and large particle estemated biomass followed a power law decrease with depth (Figure S9).

## Particle number dynamics differ from model expectations

We were able to use our modified particle remineralization and sinking model to predict particle size distributions at each depth from the particle size distribution one depth-bin shallower and the calculated flux attenuation between the two depths. We found that the observed particle size distributions usually varied from model expectations (Figure S10). Tautologically, at each depth, the observed size profile and the model predicted size profiles have same flux. However, the difference between the flux of observed and predicted *small particles* ($100-500 \mu m$), normalized to depth, serves as a metric of patterns of deviations from modeled results. We call this value *OSMS* (**O**bserved **S**mall Flux Minus **M**odeled **S**mall Flux).

$$ OSMS = \frac{(Small\,Flux\,Observed - Small\,Flux\,Modeled)}{\Delta Z}$$             

Eqn. 3


In the above equation $\Delta Z$ is the distance, in meters, between the current depth bin and the previous depth bin, whose particle size distribution is fed into the predictive model.

OSMS was positive between the photic zone and 500 m, meaning that less small flux attenuated than would be expected from the *PRiSM* model in this region. There was some variability in the OSMS parameter between casts. A general additive model, after factoring out the effect of depth, found that there was a statistically significant relationship between day of the cast and OSMS with highest values near day 10 of the study (which is when flux attenuation in this region was lowest) (*p*=0.01) (Figure S11). However there was not a statistically significant relationship between hour of the day and OSMS. 

Below 500 m, OSMS was negative. There were only two casts that reached below 500m at this station, and so an analysis of the dynamics of OSMS in this region are not possible.

At P16 Station 100, OSMS was positive between the base of the photic zone and 350m and negative below 350m (Figure S8C).


# Discussion

## Diel migrators spend time in the OMZ core
Organisms of all sizes appear to migrate into the core of the OMZ at our site. Most migrators appear to leave the surface at dusk, spend the day in the top 500m of the OMZ in the day and return to the surface at dusk (Figure 2A), while others show the opposite pattern, leaving the surface at dusk and returning at dawn (Figure 2B). Diel migration is prevalent throughout the oceans [@haysReviewAdaptiveSignificance2003; @cisewskiSeasonalVariationDiel2010; @heywoodDielVerticalMigration1996; @jiangTemporalVariabilityZooplankton2007; @rabindranathSeasonalDielVertical2011; @yangDielVerticalMigration2019; @sainmontInterIntraspecificDiurnal2014], including other OMZ sites [@antezanaSpeciesspecificPatternsDiel2009; @kikoZooplanktonMediatedFluxesEastern2020; @riquelme-buguenoDielVerticalMigration2020], including highly anoxic sites with secondary, anoxic deep chlorophyl maxima like this one [@hidalgoOntogeneticVerticalDistribution2005], and much of the ETNP OMZ [@herreraVerticalVariabilityEuphausia2019]. Sampling efforts elsewhere in the ETNP suggested that any of of these diel migrators are euphausids and fish [@maasFinescaleVerticalDistribution2014; @wishnerZooplanktonEasternTropical2013], and that diel migrators are primarely 2-5 mm in size [@wishnerZooplanktonEasternTropical2013]. Krill in the Humboldt current OMZ, migrate to the surface at night [@riquelme-buguenoDielVerticalMigration2020], as seen for some organisms at our site (Figure 1B). The presence of organisms that appear and disapear just above the base of the photic zone, in the region of the deeper anoxic fluorescence peak region, but abscence of a tell-tale signature of mass migration before or after they appear (Figure 1C) may suggest that these organisms migrate at different times of the day to this deep region, rather than all at once. Another possiblility is that they are transiting through our station at this depth in mid day, but do not migrate to depth at this location, but rather at another location.

The organisms that appear between 500m and 1000 m (Figure 2E) have acoustic signatures that resemble jellyfish [@kaartvedtDielVerticalMigration2007]. That they appear in horizontal bands that do not appear to trend upwards over time suggests that they are traveling through our site at progressively shallower depths over the course of the day, but that individual swarms are not themselves moving upward at this station. This suggests that any vertical migration carried out by these organisms happens elsewhere, or occurs more slowly than the advection seen at this site. That they appear at different depths at different times of the day suggest that these organsims have some sort of vertical migration pattern. Future work may consider more highly resolved spatial and temporal monitoring of this phenominan. Indeed molecular surveys have found evidence of both Cnidarians and Ctenophores both within and below the the ETSP OMZ near Chile (Parris et al 2014).

## Flux is lower at this site than previous measurements in the ETNP 

Flux at our site is lower at all depths than seen in previous measurements by traps at other, more productive, OMZ sites [@vanmooyImpactSuboxiaSinking2002; @hartnettOrganicCarbonInput1998].


## The flux to size relationship is typical of other sites.

The exponent of the particle size to flux relationship  that we saw at our site 2.00, is of a similar magnitude to those seen by other studies that compare UVP flux to trap flux [@guidiRelationshipParticleSize2008; @kikoZooplanktonMediatedFluxesEastern2020]. It is slightly smaler than those measurements. This could be because these values vary between sites, or that imprecision in flux measurements leads to differences in these values between studies. Indeed, we found this value was sensitive to outlying data points.

## Remineralization rates of all particles decrease in the OMZ, but disaggregation does not
Particle size profiles, particle size distribution slopes, and estimated biovolume, averaged across all casts and smoothed, are all similar to the predictions made by Weber and Bianchi's [-@weberEfficientParticleTransfer2020] "Model 1". (Figure 5), and therefor our hypotesis **HWB1**. This suggests that the low oxygen at this site decreases the particle remineralization rate of all particles, including small ones. It does not support the Weber-Bianchi Model 2 in which remineralization is suppressed in the OMZ, nor their Model 3 in which only the very large particles' remineralization is slowed. The data at the oxic site, generally conformed to Weber and Bianchi's "Model 0" [-@weberEfficientParticleTransfer2020], which was their prediciton for particle distributions at oxic sites. However, one difference was that the observed particle size distribution, while essentially constant from the base of the photic zone through 1000m, appeared to steepen between 1000 and 2000m, suggesting an increase in the abundance of small particles, relative to Model 0. This could indicate increased disaggregation in this region or horizontal transport of small particles through advection in this region.

## Zooplankton likely transport organic mater into the OMZ core.
Predicted flux levels sometimes increase between 275 and 625 meters, and at all other times attenuate very slowly in this region. The EK60 data suggest the diel migration of all sizes of organisms to this region. Taken together, the concurrent increase in flux concurs and diel migration, suggest transport of organic mater by zooplankton. That the flux varies between days suggests some day to day variability in this transport. That flux is highest in the day, on average, suggests that the diel migrators may be contributing to this flux, but the fact that this diel variability is small compared to overall variability suggests that additional factors may modulate active transport, and that nocturnal migrators may also play a role in carbon transport.

## Zooplankton likely disaggregate particles in the OMZ core.

The observation that there is greater flux by small particles (< 500 $\mu m$) than would be predicted by remineralization and sinking alone (Figure 9), between the photic zone and 500 m suggests that some process is disaggregating large particles into smaller ones. That this corresponds with the region where migratory organisms are found suggests that some of these organisms, likely small animals such as copepods and euphausids [@herreraVerticalVariabilityEuphausia2019; @maasFinescaleVerticalDistribution2014], may break down particles  [@goldthwaitEffectsPhysicalFragmentation2005; @dillingFragmentationMarineSnow2000]. Alternatively, other processes such as horizontal advection of water containing small particles [@inthornLateralParticleTransport2005] could be responsible for this increase in small particles, but there is no reason to expect horizontal differences at this site, which is at the core of the OMZ and far from shore.

Other deviations from model assumptions could also explain the increase in small particles relative to model predictions. For instance, if the model's assumed relationships between size, flux, sinking speed and biomass are not all accurate, particle dynamics might differ from our predictions. In particular, small partilces might break down more slowly than large ones, or sank more quickly for their size than expected, as has been seen elsewhere [@mcdonnellVariabilityAverageSinking2010]. Our model assumes a spherical particle drag profile, such that the particle sinking speed fractal dimension ($\gamma$) is one less than the particle size fractal dimension ($\alpha$) [@cramRoleParticleSize2018; @guidiRelationshipParticleSize2008], and that these two values sum to the particle flux fractal dimension. If any of these assumptions do not hold, or if our calculation of the particle flux fractal dimension was in error, the magnitude of the values may differ.

In contreast to the upper OMZ core, there is an apparent flattening of the particle size distribution below 500 m, beyond the expected effects generated by particle remineralization. This could suggest aggregation processes [@burdParticleAggregation2009]. Indeed, aggregation could be occurring throughout the OMZ core, but only exceed disaggreation in this region.

## Revisiting Hypotheses

Our data provide the first combined look at the relationship between particle size, particle flux and migratory organisms. Our data support only the first of the Weber-Bianchi hypotheses [@weberEfficientParticleTransfer2020], that particles of all sizes remineralize more slowly in OMZs **HWB1**. It *did not support* Weber and Bianchis hypotheses that disaggregation is lower in the OMZ **HWB2** , *nor* that the largist particles degraded particularly slowly in OMZs **HWB3**. This non-support of the final hypotheses, that large particles do not degrade particularly slowly suprised the authors, since models suggest that remineralization in the largest particles is driven by sulfate reduction, which is not as efficient as other processes [@weberEfficientParticleTransfer2020]. However, we note that our results are consistent with previous microbiology of ETNP particles at the same station that only found sulfate reducers at low levels [@saundersCompleteArsenicbasedRespiratory2019]. 

While we hypothesized temporal within and between day variability in particle size, number and flux **H1**, we only observed statistically significant temporal variability in flux, and this variability was relatively small, compared to the total amount of flux. Flux was, in general, highest in the day-time, suggesting transport by diel migrators, but this variabiliy was not very strong. This suggests, that particle sinking speed may be slow enough that the diel migratory patterns of zooplankton occur on a shorter time-scale than that at which particles sink out of different water column layers. Careful analysis of particle sinking speed estimates would help to zero in on these time scales, but is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. That the decreased flux attenuation happened more in the day, and primarely in the DVM region supported our **H2** that changes in flux corresponded with migrator abundances.

Our data supported our hypothsis particle size patterns cannot be explained by remineralization and sinking alone **H3**. Indeed the abundance of small particles above 500m, suggested either the presence of disaggreagation, or another process.

## Opportunities for future directions
Our model can produce particle remineralization rate estimates and show how this rate changes throughout the water column. We did not include those estimates in this manuscript, because those the estimates appear to be influenced by active transport into the Diel Vertical Migration (DVM) region. However, with corrections, or by focusing on the OMZ region below the DVM, it may be possible to estemate particle remineralization rates in OMZs from UVP measurments, and possibly compare these to variations in temperature and oxygen concentration, which we have previously suggested to influence particle remineralization rates [@cramRoleParticleSize2018].

We have only done these calculations at one station. We focused on one station in order to quantify within and between day variabiliy, and found this variability to be present, but low. Thus, it is now possible, to apply this analysis to measurments that we and other have collected in the ETNP, and to future measurments in the  ETNP or other OMZ regions, to test whether our model confirms Weber and Bianchi’s [-@weberEfficientParticleTransfer2020] model (**HWB1**), that particles of all sizes break down more slowly in OMZs, applies elsewhere . 
Similarly, a clear next step is to apply our disaggregation model to other ocean regions. Indeed data are already collected by other groups [@guidiRelationshipParticleSize2008; @kikoBiologicalPhysicalInfluences2017; @kikoZooplanktonMediatedFluxesEastern2020]. As temporal variability only has a smallish role, it may be reasonable to explore disaggregation like processes without the time-series globally.


# Conclusions

Particles of all sizes appear to remineralize more slowly at this OMZ site than in oxic sites. Furthermore, it appears that diel migratory organisms both disaggregate particles and transport carbon throughout the top 500m of the water column. Day to day and within day variability in organic matter transport was evident, though overall patterns in particle size, flux and disaggregation appeared to be consistant over the course of the time-series.

Shown are data from the 18000 Hz frequency band, which have highest depth penetration, but which appear to co-occur with data from other frequency bands (see Figure SX). Values are in return signal intensity and have not been normalized to observed biomass. Several interesting patterns can be seen. **A.** Two bands of organisms can be seen leaving the surface at dawn, spending the day between 250 and 500m and returning to the surface at dusk. **B.** Another group of nocturnally migrating organisms can be seen leaving the surface at dusk, spending the night near 250m and returning at dawn. **C.** Some organisms appear at the base of the photic zone, during some, but not all mid days, and then disappear in the evening. **D.** A group of very deep migrating organisms appears to leave the surface with the diel migrators and pass all the way through the OMZ and out of the EK60's field of view. It returns at dusk. **E.** Swarms of organisms appear between 500 and 1000m disappearing later in the day. Swarms appear in the deepest layers at night and appear progressively shallower as the day progresses.
