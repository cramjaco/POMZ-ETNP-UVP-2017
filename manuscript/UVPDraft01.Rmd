# Abstract

Models and observations suggest that that particle flux attenuation is lower across the mesopelagic zone of anoxic environments compared to oxic ones. This attenuation is likely a function of microbial metabolism, as well as agregation and disaggregation by zooplankton. Analysis of particle size spectra provide insight into the relative roles of aggregation, disaggregation and remineralization.

We measured particle size profiles at a station in the core of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific Oxygen Minimum Zone (ETNP OMZ) using an underwater vision profiler (UVP) multiple times of day, at different times of day, over the course of a week. We normalized our UVP measurements by comparing them to particle flux measurements measured by sediment traps. We also explored how our measurements related to acoustic observations of migratory marine species. We also compared our observations to UVP measurements from a site at a similar latitudes but with non limiting oxygen concentrations.


Particle numbers and size distributions showed a non monotocinc trend, with sharp decreases in particle numbers the photic zone and the lower 500m of the OMZ, but increases in the top 350 m of the OMZ and below the OMZ. These increases in particle number generally concurred with increases in the particle size distribution slope suggesting that the increase in particle numbers were due to a production of small particles.

Particle flux at our site was characterized by rapid attenuation in the top layer of the OMZ followed by either low attenuation or a small increase in abundance, depending on the day of the study, around 500m. This region coresponded with the presence of migratory plankton that spent the day in this region.

A model of particle remineralization and shrinking was used to diagnose whether particle size patterns violated the assumption that particles only sink and remineralize, and are neither aggregated, disaggregated, or tranported by zooplnkton. Our model identified aggregation like processes between 250 and 500m of in the water column that occurred at all time-points.

Our data suggest a role of zooplantkon in transporting biomass in the form of fecal pellets, into the core of the OMZ, but also in disaggregating particles in this same region. We further observe that there is temporal varibility in flux transport, but that this variability is small, only accounting for ~X % of the variability in flux, and not accounting for variability in particle numbers or size distribution over the one week time period studied.

# Introduction
## And:

### The biological pump is important and modulated by stuff, including zooplankton
* Sinking particles are the main way that carbon gets transported into the ocean, and the processes that regulate this biological pump regulate global atmospharic carbon levels (Kwon).

This process is known as the biological pump (ref)

* Several factors modulate this flux and include:
Particle size, 
the dependence of particle degrading microorganisms on temperature and oxygen concentrations,
the dependence of particle sinking speed on water viscocity and temperature,
faster particle sinking due to ballasting by heavy materials such as carbonate and silicate,
particle compositoin affecting breadown rates -- for instance carbonate has been suggested to protect surrounding POM from degredation by bacteria
alternatively particles in some region, or some kinds of particles may be more resistant to microbial degredation due to differences in POM content
particle shape and porosity may also affect breakdown and sinking

* Zooplankton modulate organic mater flux this flux by repackaging particles (steinberg and refs therein), feeding at the surface and excreeting at depth (bianchi 2013 and others), thereby facilitating flux of carbon, and dying at depth (Steinberg and refs therein).
* Zooplankton can further modulate flux by altering the particle size distribution. They can consume particles of a rane of sizes and repackage them into more uniform, perhaps faster sinking fecal pellets. Conversely, through sloppy feeding they can break large particles into multiple, slower sinking, smaller particles. {merge with point above}

* Oxygen minimum zones are expanding (ref) and have been postulated to play a role in changing biogeochemical cycles.

They have unique effects on zooplankton because they limit the ability of anoxia sensitive zooplankton to migrate (ref) and also limit the ability of some anoxia sensitive predators. The limiting oxygen enviornment may also impact the behavior of zooplankton that are there as they avoid oxygen requiring behavior such as feeding. 
Community structure is distinct in the OMZ  and characterized by XXX (Maas). 

### Our site
The ETNP is the biggist baddist OMZ (ref). While many OMZ, especially coastal ones, are characterized by high productivity which leads to carbon flux which removes oxygen from mid water depths (ref), the bulk of the ETNP OMZ is characterized by low productivity , with the low oxygen caused by slow ocean circulation through the OMZ region (refs clara sent). Many previous charicterizations of flux at this site, happened in coastal regions (that paper I used in my talks). Flux has not been previously characterized in this region (unless meg gets her paper out first). 
The site is characterized by nitrogen loss processes by both anammox and cannonical dentitrification processes. (Fuchsman cyano paper, probably many others). 

### Predicitons

#### Bianchi weber
* Models suggest that organic mater flux into the deep ocean is *more* efficient in oxygen minimum zones (Cram, Deveries and Weber).
** Bianchi and Weber proposed three reasons that this could occur
(1) Slower attenuation of *all* particles: The rate of remineralizatoin of all particles could be slower in OMZs.
(2) Decreased disaggregation by zooplankton: 
(3) Slower attenuation of large particles: Large particles might harbor cores that are limited in both oxygen and nitrate and so microbial metabolism could be unually slow in these.

The authors proposed that these processes would have signature effects on particle size distribution in the core of the ETNP. Slower attenuation of all particles, was predicted to result in an increase in the abundance of small particles, while the other two models, would result in a decrease in small particle abundance as small particles were either not replaced by breakdown of large particles (model 2) or as those particles were broken down more quickly than larger particles (model 3). *but* they didn't have data to determine which model was bestist.

#### Kiko
Zooplankton transport has also been postulated to be effected by zooplankton.
Kiko et al. explored zooplankotn distributions and particle size distributions in the eastern tropical north atlantic, which has a weak oxygen minimum zone. They found transport into the omz core by zooplankton. They postuated, that this was possible becaues there was still oxygen. *but* similar analysis of particle size distributions and estemates of flux haven't been done in the OMZ core. (kiko). 


### Methods

Underwater vision profilers have provided important insights into particle size distributions in the ocean.
Flux profiles measured by traps can be compared to UVP measurments to estimate the size to mass and sinking speeed relationships of particles (ref).
They can show useful things about spatial (guidi, kiko A) and temporal (kikoA and B) variability in the ocean. Indeed these data were critical in constraining a model (cram).

Traps tell us a lot about flux.

Acoustic data can tell us a lot about nekton distributions, and even those of plankton.

The meausurements have synergistic effects, as demonstrated by Kiko et al in the ETNA (damn them). 

<!-- #### Graveyard susection -->

<!-- Oxygen minimum zones have different flux patterns than other oceans because low oxygen affects microbial resperation of particles, and the behavior of migratory plankton that require oxygen, and whose predators require oxygen. Thus low oxygen could inhibit zooplankton from spending time at anoxic depths, or encorage it, if it provides protection of larger more metabolically demanding predators. -->




<!-- * Flux attenuates less in oxygen minum zones (Cram) and models have suggested a role of suppressed remineralization -->
<!-- In the ETNP OMZ decreased flux attenuation has been observed near the coast, but not in the open ocean. -->

<!-- Stuff that is known about zooplankton particle interactions. -->

<!-- Stuff that is known about particle size distributions (esp, Guidi and Kiko) -->

<!-- Particle size distributions can be compared to flux by normalizing to trap data (Guidi). -->

<!-- In the ETNA, there is a weaker OMZ and particles were compared to acoustic profiles of organims. {Findings} (Kiko 2). -->



## But
* Weber and bianchi's model hasn't been validated against real data.
* Particle size has not been normalized to observed flux in this region.

* The temporal dynamics at diel time scales have not been examined in the ETNP, or any other truly anoxic open ocean region. They have also never before been related to diel migration patterns.

* It is not known how migratory zooplankton affect particle size distributions -- either by tranport of particles, nor by disaggregaton processes.

* It is not fully known how oxygen limitation affects particle size dynamics and flux.

* Acoustic data, traps, and UVP measurments have not been combined in this region.


## Therefore

We conducted the first ever time-series analysis of particles, in the oligotrophic region of the ETNP oxygen minimum zone. With the goal of normalizing to observed flux, and comparing particle size data to acoustic data about the distributions of zooplankton and larger orgasnisms. 

* We compare this data to acoustic signature of diel migrators, of mulitple size classes

* We modified the a particle remineralization and sinking model (PRiSM) (Devries, Cram) to estemate particle size distribution changes that would occur under dynamics where particles only sink and remineralize, and compared observed distributions to ones expeced by the model. This allowed us to quantify the magnitude of non-PRiSM like processes.

* We compared our results to those seen at a station at similar latitude in a non limiting region of the tropical north pacific.


## Scientific questions:
 * How do the particle size distribution at one location in the oligotrophic Eastern Tropical North Pacific evolve with respect to depth, and how does it vary over time?
 * Do our data support any of the Bianchi-Weber models?
 * Do our data suggest regions of the oxygen minimum zone with disaggregtion like processes, and if so do these co-occur with regions suggested to harbor zooplankton.

## We hypothesized
 * Temporal day to day variability in paticle number, particles size distribution slope and flux would be evident.
 * This variability would relate to the location of migratory zooplankton, with a combenation of increased particle flux and disaggregation present where zooplankton occur.
 * Disaggregation and particle production by zooplankton might lead to particle size patterns that cannot be explained by remineralization and sinking alone.
 * All three of the Weber Bianchi hypotheses.
 

# Methods
Most measurments were taken on board the R/V Sekuliaq from 07 January 2017 thorugh 13 January 2017 at XXX Lat XXX Long. Data are compared against {describe station 100 here}

## Water property measurment
We measured water properties of temperature, salinity, fluorescence, oxygen concentration and turbidity using the shipboard XXX CTD {get sensor information}. Data were processed using seabird software and analyzed and visualized in R.

## Particle size measurments
Particle size data were collected by underwater vision profiler (UVP) that was mounted below the CTD-rosette and deployed for all CTD casts shallower than 2500m. A UVP is a combenation camera and light source that describes the abundance and size of particles from 100 microns to several centemeters in size (ref). Particles have been previously shown to be primarely "marine snow" but may also include a small number of zooplankton and visual artifacts. UVP data were processed using custom matlab scripts, uploaded to XXX, and analyzed in R.

## Flux measurments
Particles were collected in incubating particle traps (REF). Traps were used to performincubation studies which will be reported elsewhere. As part of these studies, the traps also generated data about carbon flux, which is reportd here. Two types of traps were deployed.  The particles were collected in two kinds of traps. One set of traps, generally deployed in shallower water had a solid cone opening with a X m diameter cone opening. The second set had larger conical Xm diameter 200 micron nylon mesh net at the top. In all cases particles collected in the net or cone fell into one of two chambers. The "plus-particles" chamber collected particles from the net and incubated them for an amount of time that ranged from X days to X days. The top-collector trap collected particles, and then returned immediately to the surface. We prferentially used data from the "top-collector"; however in many cases, data was only available forom the "plus-particles" trap, in which case we used that data.

{What if I move the analysis to the results section}
## Analysis

The total number of particles in each size were visualized. We calcualted total particle number by multiplying over all size bins.

### Particle size distribution

 We determined the slope and intercept of the particle size distribution spectrum by fitting a power law of form $log(# Particles) = Int + PSD * log(Size)$. Because large particles were infrequently detected we used a poisson- general linear model that considered the volume of paricles sampled and that assumed that the residuals of the data followed a poisson (rather than normal) distribution.
 
### Estimating particle flux

We estemated particle flux by assuming that particle flux in each size bin followed the equation `flux = C_f * d ^ a` (guidi 2008 ref). We used Alledredge and XXX's estemate of `a` and then fit the observed flux measurments to particle measurments to estemate C_f. We then used this equation to estimate flux from the data collected by the UVP.

### Size specific information

We seperately analyzed total particle numbers, particle size distribution, and particle flux for particles larger than 53 microns, and those smaller than 53 microns to determine the relative contributions of these two particle classes to particle properties

## Variability
We quantified whether the sample to sample variability

# Results

## Chemical Data
Temperature, salinity, density, fluorescence, oxygen and turbidity were examined (Figure 2). The oxygen minimum zone extends from the base of the primary chlorophyl maximum layer (XXXm) to 950m. This site, like many in the ETNP OMZ has two fluorescence maxima, one above, and one inside of the OMZ. Turbidity is highest above the omz, and decreases with depth, and then increases again at the base of the oxygen minimum zone.

## Acoustic data
EK60 data, figure 8. show a peak of migratory plankton which travel from the surface at dawn to a maximum depth of XXXm and then return to the surface at dusk. 

* Similar patterns between different freuencies, with better resoultion by the lower bandwidth. While we expect that small organisms likely have the greatist impact on particles, 

## Flux data
Flux measurmenets at station P2 were consistant between the different particle trap types and chambers measured, and showed a profile that broadly represented a power law with respect to depth, with the exception that flux appeared to increase around 500m.

## Particle abundance measurments 
Particles at all depths are most abundant in the smallest size fraction and less abundant in larger size fractions. At every depth, partiles roughly followed a power law with respect to size. Thus, a particle size distribution slope could be calculated at each depth and compared. {This is what the PSD slope does}. 

These patterns differed from those seen at the P16 transect, station 100 where XXXXX. 

## Estemated particle flux
When fit to the flux profile data (per Guidi et al.) we predicted that the particle flux to size ratio was best goverend by the relationship flux = cXX * size ^ aXX. As the exponent parameter in this best fit was much smaller than predicted values, we also performed a fit where that value was taken from the literature and set to aXX1. In this case the relationship was governed by the equation flux = 10.51 * size ^ axx1. This resulted in a flux profile that broadly fit the results seen by the traps (figure XX).  

### Large vs small particles

Generally the profiles are related. Most flux appears to be from smaller particles.

## Possible particle transport by zooplankton
There was an apparent increase in particle flux between XXX and XXX m (Figure X), which corresponded to the region where migratory organsisms spent most of the day (Figure X). 
To estemate how this flux increased transfer efficiency, we compared the sequestration flux (flux through the depth bin centered at 975m) to an estemated sequestration flux if a power law, typical of the flux attenuation below 500m, was applied to the flux out of the photic zone (185.5m bin). 


Extrapolating the power law relationship seen below 500m to the flux at the base of the photic zone suggests that if it was not for zooplnkton transport the transfer efficiency would be 1/3 of what it is observed to be.

{Compare to P2.}

## Variations from remineralization and sinking dynamics

By comparing the particle size distributions at each depth to the particle size distribution that woudl be predicted from the particle size distribution one depth bin shallower in the water column, and the observed flux attenuation, we were able to examine how particle number attenuation differed from what would be expected if particles sank and remineralized following PRiSM model like dynamics. We observed that there were more small particles than would be predicted from remineralization dynamics only. By comparing the observed flux of particles < 53 microns to the reminineralization-predicted flux of small particles, we observed that above 500m, there was excess observed small particle flux above 500m (Figure X). 

{Discussion: This suggested that one of two things could be happening. The first is that particle disaggregation, possibly caused by sloppy feeding by zooplankton, could be breaking large particles into smaller particles. The other possibility is that zooplankton could be preferentially removing larger particles via grazing, leaving smaller particles behind}.
