# Abstract

Models and observations suggest that that particle flux attenuation is lower across the mesopelagic zone of anoxic environments compared to oxic ones. This attenuation is likely a function of microbial metabolism, as well as agregation and disaggregation by zooplankton. Analysis of particle size spectra provide insight into the relative roles of aggregation, disaggregation and remineralization.

We measured particle size profiles at a station in the core of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific Oxygen Minimum Zone (ETNP OMZ) using an underwater vision profiler (UVP) multiple times of day, at different times of day, over the course of a week. We normalized our UVP measurements by comparing them to particle flux measurements measured by sediment traps, and we compared our observations to UVP measurements from similar latitudes but with higher oxygen concentrations.

Particle flux attenuated more slowly in the ETNP OMZ than in a similar latitude oxic environment transect. Indeed, flux appeared to increase not only in the photic zone, but at several depth intervals within the anoxic zone, as well as at the base of the OMZ. 

By comparing observed particle size distributions to those predicted by models in which particles remineralized, but did not aggregate or disaggreagate, we were able to quantify net rates of disaggreagation and how they varied throughout the water column. We found that particles appeared to disaggregate above and below the oxygen minimum zone, but not in the core of the OMZ.

These patterns suggest that the oxygen minimum zone affects, but does not eliminate the role of zooplankton in transporting organic carbon to depth, and breaking large particles into smaller particles due to sloppy feeding.

# Introduction

* Some steinberg model of the role of zooplankton in flux.
* Likely different in OMZ

* Flux attenuates less in oxygen minum zones (Cram) and models have suggested a role of suppressed remineralization
In the ETNP OMZ decreased flux attenuation has been observed near the coast, but not in the open ocean.

# Methods
All measurments were taken on board the R/V Sekuliaq from XX January 2017 thorugh XX January 2017 at XXX Lat XXX Long.

## Water property measurment
We measured water properties of temperature, salinity, fluorescence, oxygen concentration and turbidity using a XXX CTD {get sensor information}. Data were processed using seabird software and analyzed and visualized in R.

## Particle size measurments
Particle size data were collected by underwater vision profiler (UVP) that was mounted to the CTD and deployed for all CTD casts shallower than 2500m. A UVP is a combenation camera and light source that describes the abundance and size of particles from 100 microns to several centemeters in size (ref). Particles have been previously shown to be primarely "marine snow" but may also include a small number of zooplankton and visual artifacts. UVP data were processed using custom matlab scripts, and analyzed in R.

## Flux measurments
Particles were collected in incubating particle traps (REF). Traps were used to performincubation studies which will be reported elsewhere. As part of these studies, the traps also generated data about carbon flux, which is reportd here. Two types of traps were deployed.  The particles were collected in two kinds of traps. One set of traps, generally deployed in shallower water had a solid cone opening with a X m diameter cone opening. The second set had larger conical Xm diameter 200 micron nylon mesh net at the top. In all cases particles collected in the net or cone fell into one of two chambers. The "plus-particles" chamber collected particles from the net and incubated them for an amount of time that ranged from X days to X days. The top-collector trap collected particles, and then returned immediately to the surface. We prferentially used data from the "top-collector"; however in many cases, data was only available forom the "plus-particles" trap, in which case we used that data.

## Analysis

The total number of particles in each size were visualized. We calcualted total particle number by multiplying over all size bins.

### Particle size distribution

 We determined the slope and intercept of the particle size distribution spectrum by fitting a power law of form $log(# Particles) = Int + PSD * log(Size)$. Because large particles were infrequently detected we used a poisson- general linear model that considered the volume of paricles sampled and that assumed that the residuals of the data followed a poisson (rather than normal) distribution.
 
### Estimating particle flux

We estemated particle flux by assuming that particle flux in each size bin followed the equation `flux = C_f * d ^ a` (guidi 2008 ref). We used Alledredge and XXX's estemate of `a` and then fit the observed flux measurments to particle measurments to estemate C_f. We then used this equation to estimate flux from the data collected by the UVP.

### Size specific information

We seperately analyzed total particle numbers, particle size distribution, and particle flux for particles larger than 53 microns, and those smaller than 53 microns to determine the relative contributions of these two particle classes to particle properties

## Variability
We quantified whether the sample to sample variability

# Results

## Chemical Data
Temperature, salinity, density, fluorescence, oxygen and turbidity were examined (Figure 2). The oxygen minimum zone extends from the base of the primary chlorophyl maximum layer (XXXm) to 950m. This site, like many in the ETNP OMZ has two fluorescence maxima, one above, and one inside of the OMZ. Turbidity is highest above the omz, and decreases with depth, and then increases again at the base of the oxygen minimum zone.

## Acoustic data
EK60 data, not shown, show a peak of migratory plankton which travel from the surface at dawn to a maximum depth of XXXm and then return to the surface at dusk. 

## Particle abundance measurments 
Particles at all depths are most abundant in the smallest size fraction and less abundant in larger size fractions. It was typical to observe no particles larger than Xmm.
The total number of particles at each depth was _______. Most of these were small particles (Figure X).

Trap types are shown by the shape and color of the large points. Superimposed are binned estemates of particle flux generated by fitting the particle size distribution to the trap counts.

Figure 7. **A** Flux profile from smoothed particle size distributions. Regions where flux is *increasing* are coded as {color}. **B** Particle disaggregation, measured by comparing the expectation of a model in which there is no disaggregation to one in which there is disaggregation. It is the descrepancy between the observed and model predicted flux of small particles, devided by the attenuation of large particles. In other words it is the fraction of the decrease in large particle flux that appears as small particle flux.

Figure S1. Observed particle size distribution superimposed and the gam fitted particle mean and bootstrapped 95% prediction intervals of those size distributions. That statisticaclly siginificantly more points fall outside of the prediction intervals than by chance alone suggests that there is more variability between points than predicted by random sampling effects alone.
