  abstract = {Infiltration and runoff from manured agricultural fields can result in livestock pathogens reaching groundwater and surface waters. Here, we measured the effectiveness of glass wool filters to simultaneously concentrate enteric viruses and bacteria of bovine origin from water. The recovery efficiencies were determined for bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, bovine rotavirus group A, bovine coronavirus, poliovirus Sabin III, toxigenic Escherichia coli ,and Campylobacter jejuni seeded into water with three different turbidity levels (0.5, 215, and 447~NTU). Twenty liters of dechlorinated tap water (pH 7) were seeded with the test organisms, and then passed through a glass wool filter using a peristaltic pump (flow rate~=~1~liter~min−1). Retained organisms were eluted from the filters by passing beef extract-glycine buffer (pH 9.5) in the direction opposite of sample flow. Recovered organisms were enumerated by qPCR except for C. jejuni, which was quantified by culture. Mean recovery efficiencies ranged from 55 to 33~\% for the bacteria and 58 to 16~\% for the viruses. Using bootstrapping techniques combined with Analysis of Variance, recovery efficiencies were found to differ among the pathogen types tested at the two lowest turbidity levels; however, for a given pathogen type turbidity did not affect recovery except for C. jejuni. Glass wool filtration is a cost-effective method for concentrating several waterborne pathogens of bovine origin simultaneously, although recovery may be low for some specific taxa such as bovine viral diarrhea virus 1.},

Along with other nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses, they compose a new proposed order—named Megavirales—whose origin and evolution generate heated debate in the scientific community. The presence of an arsenal of genes not widespread in the virosphere related to important steps of the translational process, including transfer RNAs, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and translation factors for peptide synthesis, constitutes an important element of this debate. In this review, we highlight the main findings to date about the translational machinery of the mimiviruses and compare their distribution along the distinct members of the family Mimiviridae. Furthermore, we discuss how the presence and/or absence of the translation-related genes among mimiviruses raises important insights to boost the debate on their origin and evolutionary history.},

  abstract = {The coagulation of phytoplankton, a fundamental mechanism for vertical flux in the oceans and a possible predatory escape mechanism, is a function of the density of suspended particles and at least three enigmatic system processes: the encounter rate of the particles; the contact efficiency of various sized particles upon encounter; and the efficiency of sticking upon contact. A variant of a continuous coagulation model, including the second-order aggregation rate representation and data obtained from the 1993 SIGMA tank experiment at Santa Barbara, are used first to estimate 'stickiness', the efficiency of sticking given that a collision occurs. Primary tools are an inverse, least squares methodology, an aggregation model, and an individual growth model for phytoplankton. The model output corresponds well with the data for smaller sized particles ({$<$}0.4 mm'): however, predicted densities for larger particles were less than observed, and the predicted timing of the bloom was earlier than observed. These anomalies led to an investigation of the interacting roles of stickiness, contact efficiency, and nutrient storage in individual cells. The analyses suggest that (i) aggregation is relatively insensitive to the sticking efficiency, and thus it is difficult to estimate stickiness accurately by fitting aggregation data; (ii) contact efficiency appears to be more functionally variable than assumed in traditional representations, and estimating contact efficiency, jointly with the sticking efficiency, generally produces better agreement with the SIGMA experimental size particle data spectrum; (iii) for the SIGMA tank environment, estimates of contact efficiency are dimensionally more closely related to diameter than to the traditional surface area representation; and (iv) stored nutrient reserves may play a fundamental role in governing timing of peak algal bloom and dynamics of aggregates; inclusion of nutrient storage improves estimation of peak bloom, but does not significantly improve prediction of aggregate dynamics in the SIGMA tank experiment.},

As such, they are thought to have a major impact on all aspects of microbial community structure and function. Despite this critical role in ecosystem processes, the study of virus/phage diversity has lagged far behind parallel studies of the bacterial and eukaryotic kingdoms, largely due to the absence of any universal phylogenetic marker. Here we review the development and use of signature genes to investigate viral diversity, as a viable strategy for data sets of specific virus groups. Genes that have been used include those encoding structural proteins, such as portal protein, major capsid protein, and tail sheath protein, auxiliary metabolism genes, such as psbA, psbB, and phoH, and several polymerase genes. These marker genes have been used in combination with PCR-based fingerprinting and/or sequencing strategies to investigate spatial, temporal, and seasonal variations and diversity in a wide range of habitats.},

Prochlorococcus reaching up to 2.5 (.) 105 cells ml(-1) numerically dominated the picophytoplankton community in the central oligotrophic Atlantic waters while Synechococcus was abundant at the ends of the transects (i.e. in nutrient rich coastal waters). High resolution surface samples showed the meridional patterns of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus abundance to be highly variable within a few degrees latitude and correlated well with intermediate scale variability ({$<$} 500 km) in water mass structure along the transects. Growth rates of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus in surface waters range from 0.40 to 1.47 d(-1), and 0.22 to 1.58 d(-1), respectively.

  abstract = {Abstract We report on a 16-month time series of the primary productivity, chlorophyll biomass and environmental variables in Ishikari Bay, the western Hokkaido coast, from September 2006 to December 2007. During productive summer and autumn seasons, the average phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a) and productivity were 4.7~±~0.4~μg~Chl a~L−1 and 229.2~±~113.4~μg~C~L−1~d−1, and 5.9~±~6.0~μg~Chl a~L−1 and 138.9~±~202.6~μg~C~L−1~d−1, respectively. The water column salinity profiles suggested that nutrient upwelling from bottom waters, especially in summer and autumn, when autotrophic production was at a maximum, was the major source of nutrients fueling the productivity in near-surface waters. Size-fractionation measurements showed that the micro-size fraction (\&gt;10~μm) accounted for~\&gt;~80\% of the total phytoplankton biomass and productivity. The strong correlation of POC with Chl a (r~=~0.875; P~\&lt;~0.001; n~=~16) suggests that living phytoplankton in POC may outweigh detrital and bacterial biomass. Stoichiometrical analysis of inorganic nutrients revealed a seasonal low (13) and high (25) DIN-to-PO4 ratio and a seasonal low (30) and high (37) Si-to-PO4 ratio, suggesting that phytoplankton growth was possibly limited by nitrate and phosphate and not by silicic acid. We conclude that bottom-advection of nutrients resulting from wind-driven mixing may have been a significant source of nutrient input in this oligotrophic coastal system, and zooplankton grazing or other losses might be a crucial factor in controlling the phytoplankton biomass and production, particularly in spring. Also, it is probable that phytoplankton growth was not prevented by insufficient light in Ishikari Bay considering the values of both mean light intensity in the mixed layer (Im) and the mixing and euphotic depth ratio (Zmix:Zeu).},

However, very little attention has been given to the dynamics of grazers, especially heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), in such experiments. We found temporal changes in concentrations of ciliates and HNF in a dilution experiment using water from the oligotrophic N.W. Mediterranean Sea. Ciliates decreased markedly over 24~h when held in seawater diluted with particle-free water (60\% and 20\% final conc whole seawater) while HNF increased in concentration in the same treatments. Using a time-course approach in a second experiment, we monitored changes in HNF and bacterioplankton concentrations in 20\% whole seawater (80\% particle-free seawater). Both HNF and heterotrophic bacteria displayed stable concentrations for the first 12~h and then grew rapidly, especially HNF, from 12 to 24~h. Examination of bacterial community composition using denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) showed a change in community composition over the 24h incubation period. Dilution can have differential effects on the distinct components of the marine microbial food web.},

In a dataset of more than 830~000 pyrotags, we identified 10~780~OTUs of which 52\% were singletons. The singletons accounted for less than 2\% of the OTU abundance, whereas the 100 and 1000 most abundant OTUs represented 80\% and 96\% respectively of all recovered OTUs. Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling and Canonical Correspondence Analysis of all the OTUs excluding the singletons revealed a clear clustering of the bacterial communities according to the water masses. More than 80\% of the 1000 most abundant OTUs corresponded to Proteobacteria of which 55\% were Alphaproteobacteria, mostly composed of the SAR11 cluster. Gammaproteobacteria increased with depth and included a relatively large number of OTUs belonging to Alteromonadales and Oceanospirillales. The bathypelagic zone showed higher taxonomic evenness than the overlying waters, albeit bacterial diversity was remarkably variable. Both abundant and low-abundance OTUs were responsible for the distinct bacterial communities characterizing the major deep-water masses. Taken together, our results reveal that deep-water masses act as bio-oceanographic islands for bacterioplankton leading to water mass-specific bacterial communities in the deep waters of the Atlantic.},

  abstract = {Much of the diversity of prokaryotic viruses has yet to be described. In particular, there are no viral isolates that infect abundant, globally significant marine archaea including the phylum Thaumarchaeota. This phylum oxidizes ammonia, fixes inorganic carbon, and thus contributes to globally significant nitrogen and carbon cycles in the oceans. Metagenomics provides an alternative to culture-dependent means for identifying and characterizing viral diversity. Some viruses carry auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) that are acquired via horizontal gene transfer from their host(s), allowing inference of what host a virus infects. Here we present the discovery of 15 new genomically and ecologically distinct Thaumarchaeota virus populations, identified as contigs that encode viral capsid and thaumarchaeal ammonia monooxygenase genes (amoC). These viruses exhibit depth and latitude partitioning and are distributed globally in various marine habitats including pelagic waters, estuarine habitats, and hydrothermal plume water and sediments. We found evidence of viral amoC expression and that viral amoC AMGs sometimes comprise up to half of total amoC DNA copies in cellular fraction metagenomes, highlighting the potential impact of these viruses on N cycling in the oceans. Phylogenetics suggest they are potentially tailed viruses and share a common ancestor with related marine Euryarchaeota viruses. This work significantly expands our view of viruses of globally important marine Thaumarchaeota.},

  abstract = {Pathogenic human viruses cause over half of gastroenteritis cases associated with recreational water use worldwide. They are difficult to concentrate from environmental waters due to low numbers and small sizes. Rapid enumeration of viruses by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has the potential to improve water quality analysis and risk assessment. However, capturing and recovering~these viruses from environmental water remain formidable barriers to routine use. Here, we compared the recovery efficiencies of human adenoviruses (HAdVs) and human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) from 10-L river water samples seeded with raw human wastewater (100 and 10~mL) using hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF) and glass wool filter (GWF) methods. The mean recovery efficiencies of HAdVs in river water samples through HFUF were 36 and 86~\% for 100 and 10~mL of seeded human wastewater, respectively. In contrast, the estimated mean recovery efficiencies of HAdVs in river water samples through GWF were 1.3 and 3~\% for 100 and 10~mL seeded raw human wastewater, respectively. Similar trends were also observed for HPyVs. Recovery efficiencies of HFUF method were significantly higher (P\,{$<$}\,0.05) than GWF for both HAdVs and HPyVs. Our results clearly suggest that HFUF would be a preferred method for concentrating HAdVs and HPyVs from river water followed by subsequent detection and quantification with PCR/qPCR assays.},

  abstract = {Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is accompanied by the shedding of the virus in stool. Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections among the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The estimated RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation. Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations. This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities. The work also draws attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Discovering the key microbial species and environmental factors of microbial community and characterizing their relationships with other members are critical to ecosystem studies. The microbial co-occurrence patterns across a variety of environmental settings have been extensively characterized. However, previous studies were limited by their restriction toward pairwise relationships, while there was ample evidence of third-party mediated co-occurrence in microbial communities. METHODS: We implemented and applied the triplet-based liquid association analysis in combination with the local similarity analysis procedure to microbial ecology data. We developed an intuitive scheme to visualize those complex triplet associations along with pairwise correlations. Using a time series from the marine microbial ecosystem as example, we identified pairs of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) where the strength of their associations appeared to relate to the values of a third "mediator" variable. These "mediator" variables appear to modulate the associations between pairs of bacteria. RESULTS: Using this analysis, we were able to assess the OTUs' ability to regulate its functional partners in the community, typically not manifested in the pairwise correlation patterns. For example, we identified Flavobacteria as a multifaceted player in the marine microbial ecosystem, and its clades were involved in mediating other OTU pairs. By contrast, SAR11 clades were not active mediators of the community, despite being abundant and highly correlated with other OTUs. Our results suggested that Flavobacteria are more likely to respond to situations where particles and unusual sources of dissolved organic material are prevalent, such as after a plankton bloom. On the other hand, SAR11s are oligotrophic chemoheterotrophs with inflexible metabolisms, and their relationships with other organisms may be less governed by environmental or biological factors. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating liquid association with local similarity analysis to explore the mediated co-varying dynamics, we presented a novel perspective and a useful toolkit to analyze and interpret time series data from microbial community. Our augmented association network analysis is thus more representative of the true underlying dynamic structure of the microbial community. The analytic software in this study was implemented as new functionalities of the ELSA (Extended local similarity analysis) tool, which is available for free download ( http://bitbucket.org/charade/elsa ).},

  abstract = {This study aims to assess the removal efficiency of microbial contaminants in a local wastewater treatment plant over the duration of one year, and to assess the microbial risk associated with reusing treated wastewater in agricultural irrigation. The treatment process achieved 3.5 logs removal of heterotrophic bacteria and up to 3.5 logs removal of fecal coliforms. The final chlorinated effluent had 1.8~×~102 MPN/100~mL of fecal coliforms and fulfils the required quality for restricted irrigation. 16S rRNA gene-based high-throughput sequencing showed that several genera associated with opportunistic pathogens (e.g. Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Arcobacter, Legionella, Mycobacterium, Neisseria, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus) were detected at relative abundance ranging from 0.014 to 21 \% of the total microbial community in the influent. Among them, Pseudomonas spp. had the highest approximated cell number in the influent but decreased to less than 30 cells/100~mL in both types of effluent. A culture-based approach further revealed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was mainly found in the influent and non-chlorinated effluent but was replaced by other Pseudomonas spp. in the chlorinated effluent. Aeromonas hydrophila could still be recovered in the chlorinated effluent. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) determined that only chlorinated effluent should be permitted for use in agricultural irrigation as it achieved an acceptable annual microbial risk lower than 10−4 arising from both P. aeruginosa and A. hydrophila. However, the proportion of bacterial isolates resistant to 6 types of antibiotics increased from 3.8\% in the influent to 6.9\% in the chlorinated effluent. Examples of these antibiotic-resistant isolates in the chlorinated effluent include Enterococcus and Enterobacter spp. Besides the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial isolates, tetracycline resistance genes tetO, tetQ, tetW, tetH, tetZ were also present at an average 2.5~×~102, 1.6~×~102, 4.4~×~102, 1.6~×~101 and 5.5~×~103 copies per mL of chlorinated effluent. Our study highlighted that potential risks associated with the reuse of treated wastewater arise not only from conventional fecal indicators or known pathogens, but also from antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes.},

  abstract = {With a high proportion of diel migratory zooplankton and low particle fluxes, the oligotrophic subtropical Pacific is a region where migrant-mediated export of materials across the base of the euphotic zone should be particularly important for elemental budgets. To assess the magnitude of this export flux at Stn. ALOHA (22°45′N, 158°W), we determined size-structured migrant biomass on 26 cruises (1994–1996) and used allometric equations to compute metabolic losses of respiratory carbon (DIC) and excreted ammonium (DIN) at the migrant's daytime depth (temperature). Depth-integrated (155 m) migrant biomass varied interannually from 286 to 457 mg DW m−2 and seasonally from 285 to 550 mg DW m−2 (fall versus spring), with an overall average of 394 mg DW m−2. The 2–5 mm size-fraction always dominated. Migrant fluxes varied from 0.22 to 0.37 mmol DIC m−2 d−1 and from 0.033 to 0.055 mmol DIN m−2 d−1 between years, with an overall average of 0.304 mmol C and 0.045 mmol N m−2 d−1 (15 and 20\% of trap PC and PN fluxes). The fluxes were highest in the spring (0.405 mmol C and 0.060 mmol N m−2 d−1; 18 and 24\% of trap PC and PN). Strong migratory taxa, defined as those that were virtually absent from the euphotic zone during the day, were dominated by Pleuromamma and Euphausia spp. and Aetideid copepods and accounted for 40\% of the total biomass-derived estimates. Using mean cruise biomass structures and temperature information from Stn. ALOHA, migrant flux estimates with different literature-derived metabolic relationships and assumptions typically varied within 20\% for carbon and 25\% for nitrogen. When compared on the same basis, migrant flux estimates as \% trap fluxes were higher for oligotrophic regions compared to the high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll equatorial Pacific. Long-term averages of migrant biomass were substantially (two- to three-fold) higher in the subtropical Pacific compared to the Atlantic, but migrant flux estimates were similar due to higher temperatures (18 versus 9°C) at daytime depths in the Atlantic. Including the effects of undersampled micronekton, dissolved organic excretion, mortality losses at depth and inter-zonal fecal transport, mean flux estimates were about doubled for carbon (30\% of trap PC) and approximately tripled for nitrogen (57\% of trap PN) relative to those for DIC and DIN metabolic losses.},

Noticeably rare, however, are attempts to quantify temporal variation in the structure of plant–pollinator networks, and to determine whether the status of species as specialists or generalists is stable. Here we show that network structure varied through time in a montane meadow community from southern California, USA, in that pollinator species did not form the same links with plant species across years. Furthermore, composition of the generalized core group of species in the network varied among summers, as did the identity of those species involved in relationships that appeared to be reciprocally specialized within any one summer. These differences appear to be related to severe drought conditions experienced in the second summer of the 3 year study. In contrast to this variation, the pollinator community remained similarly highly nested in all three summers, even though species were packed into the nested matrix differently from year to year. These results suggest that plant–pollinator networks vary in detail through time, while retaining some basic topological properties. This dynamic aspect of community-scale interactions has implications for both ecological and evolutionary inferences about pollination mutualisms.},

Similarity in the size-specific POC, PON, and mass content of different types of aggregates indicates that the quantities of these materials existing in the larger particle size fractions of the upper ocean could be estimated from profiles of particle size and abundance with depth obtained with in situ camera systems. Such estimates will allow assessment of the availability of marine snow to large particle consumers and decomposers and to sedimentation processes.},

  abstract = {Macroscopic aggregates of detritus, living organisms and inorganic matter known as marine snow, have significance in the ocean both as unique, partially isolated microenvironments and as transport agents: much of surface-derived matter in the ocean fluxes to the ocean interior and the sea floor as marine snow. As microhabitats, marine snow aggregates contain enriched microbial communities and chemical gradients within which processes of photosynthesis, decomposition, and nutrient regeneration occur at highly elevated levels. Microbial communities associated with marine snow undergo complex successional changes on time scales of hours to days which significantly alter the chemical and biological properties of the particles. Marine snow can be produced either de novo by living plants and animals especially as mucus feeding webs of zooplankton, or by the biologically-enhanced physical aggregation of smaller particles. By the latter pathway, microaggregates, phytoplankton, fecal pellets, organic debris and clay-mineral particles collide by differential settlement or physical shear and adhere by the action of various, biologically-generated, organic compounds. Diatom flocculation is a poorly understood source of marine snow of potential global significance. Rates of snow production and breakdown are not known but are critical to predicting flux and to understanding biological community structure and transformations of matter and energy in the water column. The greatest challenge to the study of marine snow at present is the development of appropriate technology to measure abundances and characteristics of aggregates in situ.},

  abstract = {Blooms of chain-forming marine diatoms were observed in the process of aggregating into centimeter-sized flocs of marine snow in surface waters of the Santa Barbara Channel, California. These aggregates were composed of a rich assemblage of living, actively photosynthesizing diatoms dominated by the setose genus Chaetoceros and by chain-forming Nitzschia spp. Flocculation of one bloom occurred in as little as 24 h, and bloom flocculation apparently was not triggered by nitrogen-limitation. Marine snow of diatom origin was also abundant during spring, summer and early autumn throughout the Southern California Bight, suggesting that diatom flocculation is a seasonally significant source of marine snow. Resting spores rarely occurred within either newly formed or aged diatom flocs. The mean in situ settling velocity (± S.D.) of newly formed flocs was 117 ± 56 m d−1, two orders of magnitude faster than unaggregated Chaetoceros. Rapid, episodic export of surface-derived primary production to the ocean bottom via mass flocculation and settlement of diatom blooms can occur prior to consumption by pelagic grazers and significantly effects marine food webs, oceanic flux processes, and diatom biology.},

  abstract = {While the aggregation and mass settlement of diatoms at the termination of blooms results in significant export of carbon from the surface ocean, the mechanisms of bloom aggregation have been poorly understood. The aggregation of a multispecies diatom bloom was investigated under controlled conditions in a 1200 liter, nutrient-enriched, laboratory mesocosm in order to elucidate the parameters sufficient to accurately predict bloom aggregation. A diverse bloom of diatoms dominated by several species of Chaetoceros and Thalassiosira progressed through a classic pattern of exponential, stationary, and senescent phases in the mesocosm. Aggregates larger than 0.5 mm became detectable on the eighth day after inoculation, and aggregates \&gt;1 mm increased exponentially from Day 10 onward producing the appearance of a mass aggregation event late on Day 10. The bloom aggregated sequentially with Thalassiosira dominating early aggregates and Chaetoceros dominating later ones. Chaetoceros resting spores formed only in aggregates. Aggregation was not linked to nutrient depletion or to the physiological state of the cells since the onset of aggregation and the mass aggregation event occurred 1 to 3 days prior to nutrient depletion and while carbon:nitrogen ratios of cells were still very low and growth rates high. Moreover, visible aggregates did not form in the mesocosm until cell abundances were considerably higher than abundances observed to aggregate in nature, suggesting that aggregation was not strongly linked to phytoplankton cell concentration. Complementary studies in this volume clarify the role of non-phytoplankton particles in aggregation of the mesocosm bloom. The mesocosm approach proved highly effective in producing an aggregating diatom bloom under controlled conditions.},

  abstract = {Abiotic fragmentation of large, rapidly sinking aggregates into smaller, suspended particles by fluid shear has been suggested as an important process governing the particle size spectrum in the ocean and as one explanation for the exponential decrease of particulate flux with depth below the euphotic zone. We investigated this process by quantifying the small-scale energy dissipation rates required to disaggregate marine snow settling through a gradient of turbulent kinetic energy in a laboratory tank. Aggregates of detrital debris, gelatinous houses of larvacean tunicates, and aggregates of living bacteria did not break apart even at energy dissipation rates ≫1 cm2 s−3. The rate of energy dissipation required to disaggregate fragile diatom flocs up to 25 mm long ranged from 10−3 to {$>$} 1 cm2 s−3 and increased exponentially with decreasing maximum aggregate diameter. Aged diatom aggregates were significantly stronger than otherwise identical but unaged particles. These results indicate that only the highest shears associated with storm events or flows in tidal channels would be able to fragment even the most fragile organic aggregates in the upper ocean. Biological processes of disaggregation, such as animal grazing, appear far more likely to mediate the size spectrum of aggregated particulate matter in the ocean than abiotic fragmentation due to fluid motion.},

  abstract = {Marine Group A (MGA) is a candidate phylum of Bacteria that is ubiquitous and abundant in the ocean. Despite being prevalent, the structural and functional properties of MGA populations remain poorly constrained. Here, we quantified MGA diversity and population structure in relation to nutrients and O2 concentrations in the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the Northeast subarctic Pacific Ocean using a combination of catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) and 16S small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing (clone libraries and 454-pyrotags). Estimates of MGA abundance as a proportion of total bacteria were similar across all three methods although estimates based on CARD-FISH were consistently lower in the OMZ (5.6\%±1.9\%) than estimates based on 16S rRNA gene clone libraries (11.0\%±3.9\%) or pyrotags (9.9\%±1.8\%). Five previously defined MGA subgroups were recovered in 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and five novel subgroups were defined (HF770D10, P262000D03, P41300E03, P262000N21 and A714018). Rarefaction analysis of pyrotag data indicated that the ultimate richness of MGA was very nearly sampled. Spearman’s rank analysis of MGA abundances by CARD-FISH and O2 concentrations resulted in significant correlation. Analyzed in more detail by 16S rRNA pyrotag sequencing, MGA operational taxonomic units affiliated with subgroups Arctic95A-2 and A714018 comprised 0.3–2.4\% of total bacterial sequences and displayed strong correlations with decreasing O2 concentration. This study is the first comprehensive description of MGA diversity using complementary techniques. These results provide a phylogenetic framework for interpreting future studies on ecotype selection among MGA subgroups, and suggest a potentially important role for MGA in the ecology and biogeochemistry of OMZs.},

  abstract = {Although it is generally accepted that plant community composition is key for predicting rates of ecosystem processes in the face of global change, microbial community composition is often ignored in ecosystem modeling. To address this issue, we review recent experiments and assess whether microbial community composition is resistant, resilient, or functionally redundant in response to four different disturbances. We find that the composition of most microbial groups is sensitive and not immediately resilient to disturbance, regardless of taxonomic breadth of the group or the type of disturbance. Other studies demonstrate that changes in composition are often associated with changes in ecosystem process rates. Thus, changes in microbial communities due to disturbance may directly affect ecosystem processes. Based on these relationships, we propose a simple framework to incorporate microbial community composition into ecosystem process models. We conclude that this effort would benefit from more empirical data on the links among microbial phylogeny, physiological traits, and disturbance responses. These relationships will determine how readily microbial community composition can be used to predict the responses of ecosystem processes to global change.},

However, the current technologies used in water desalination are also accompanied by negative environmental impacts especially on the surrounding marine ecosystems. Since major seawater desalination plants are located by the shoreline, the main environmental considerations in desalination are water intakes and sea outfall discharges. We intent through this study to evaluate the potential of current polar orbiting satellites in evaluating the Impact of desalination plant discharges, usually used to dispose of brine waste stream, on surrounding ecosystems and water quality. The objective of this project is to develop an automated approach for monitoring water quality and temperature (thermal properties) surrounding the discharges of desalination plants in the UAE coastal areas. Visible and thermal measurements provided by MODIS sensors on board of Terra and Aqua satellites are used in this project The first four bands (visible) and band 31 \& 32 (thermal) were selected Future multi-spectral data from DubaiSat-1 (5-m resolution) will be also used to detect small changes in water color that cannot be detected with the MODIS data (250 m).},

Alphaproteobacteria were the dominant group on an annual basis [29\% of the DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) counts by CARD-FISH, and 70\% of the bacterial clones]. The SAR11 clade was most abundant during spring and summer ({$>$}20\% of DAPI counts), while the Roseobacter clade was abundant primarily in winter and spring (up to 7\% of DAPI counts). The phylum Bacteroidetes constituted the second most important group and was quantitatively uniform throughout the year (average 11\% of the DAPI counts). Gammaproteobacteria showed a peak during summer (8\% of DAPI counts), when most of them belonged to the NOR5 cluster. Clone libraries and CARD-FISH showed reasonable agreement in the quantitative proportions of Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria, but Alphaproteobacteria were overrepresented in clone libraries. Sequencing of the most predominant DGGE bands failed to detect the SAR11 group despite their high abundance.

In Baltic Sea pelagic redoxclines, Epsilonproteobacteria of the genus Sulfurimonas (subgroup GD17) have been shown to dominate chemoautotrophic denitrification. However, little is known on the loss processes affecting this prokaryotic group. In the present study, the protist grazing impact on the Sulfurimonas subgroup GD17 was determined for suboxic and oxygen/hydrogen sulphide interface depths of Baltic Sea redoxclines, using predator exclusion assays and bacterial amendment with the cultured representative ‘Sulfurimonas gotlandica’ strain GD1. Additionally, the principal bacterivores were identified by RNA-Stable Isotope Probing (RNA-SIP). The natural Sulfurimonas subgroup GD17 population grew strongly under oxygen/hydrogen sulphide interface conditions (doubling time: 1–1.5 days), but protist grazing could consume the complete new cell production per day. In suboxic samples, little or no growth of Sulfurimonas subgroup GD17 was observed. RNA-SIP identified five active grazers, belonging to typical redoxcline ciliates (Oligohymenophorea, Prostomatea) and globally widespread marine flagellate groups (MAST-4, Chrysophyta, Cercozoa). Overall, we demonstrate for the first time that protist grazing can control the growth, and potentially the vertical distribution, of a chemolithoautotrophic key-player of oxic/anoxic interfaces.},

We review (1) recent studies on the environmental pressures that promote HABs; (2) prominent strategies for preventing or controlling blooms; (3)~modeling methods, specifically addressing harmful algal species dynamics, and their use as a predictive tool to facilitate mitigation; and then (4) highlight several coastal regions where the mitigation of HABs is generally approached from a regional Earth system and observation framework.

However, for marine pelagic redoxclines almost no knowledge exists on the magnitude of the loss processes affecting these prokaryotic communities. We assessed the importance of protist grazing and viral lysis as prokaryotic mortality factors for 2 central Baltic Sea redoxclines using a combination of microscopy and experimental community manipulation techniques. Our results demonstrate that protist grazing dominated prokaryotic mortality at suboxic ({$<$}30 mu mol l(-1) oxygen) and oxygen-hydrogen sulphide interface depths, with 50 to 100\% of prokaryotic standing stocks grazed daily, compared to 2 to 20\% of virally infected cells. Grazing was mediated by 2 different protist associations, viz. dinoflagellates and Strombidium-like ciliates in the suboxic zone, and larger ciliates (cf. Mesodinium, Metacystis spp., cf. Coleps and un-identified morphotypes) at the oxygen-hydrogen sulphide interface. In contrast, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) played a minor role, generally grazing {$<$}5\% daily of prokaryotic standing stocks. Thus, these redox zones show major differences in microbial food web structure when compared to surface waters, with ciliates and dinoflagellates constituting the major bacterivores instead of HNF. At sulphidic depths, grazing was below the detection limit, and the frequency of virally infected cells decreased, leaving the identity of the major pro karyotic mortality factor at these depths unresolved.},

  abstract = {HIV persists, despite effective antiretroviral therapy, in long-lived cells, posing a major barrier toward a cure. A key step in the HIV replication cycle and a hallmark of the Retroviridae family is the integration of the viral DNA into the host genome. Once integrated, HIV expression is regulated by host machinery and the provirus persists until the cell dies. A reservoir of cells harboring replication-competent proviruses can survive for years, and mechanisms that maintain that reservoir are under investigation. The majority of integrated proviruses, however, are defective or have large deletions, and the composition of the proviral landscape during therapy remains unknown. Methods to quantify HIV proviruses are useful in investigating HIV persistence. Presented in this unit is a method for total HIV DNA quantification of various HIV genome targets that utilizes the next-generation PCR platform, digital PCR. The abundance of various HIV gene targets reflects the overall proviral composition. In this protocol, total genomic DNA is isolated from patient-derived cells and then used as a template for droplet digital PCR, in which the PCR reaction is partitioned into approximately 20,000 individual droplets, PCR amplified to an end point, and subjected to absolute quantification by counting the number of positive and negative droplets. Copy number is directly calculated using straightforward Poisson correction. Additionally, this methodological approach can be used to obtain absolute quantification of other DNA targets. © 2018 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Questions regarding such things as the mobility of the interfacial water, the nature of the ice phase and the factors governing the quantity of water remaining unfrozen under given conditions have been answered, at least in qualitative terms. The unfrozen, interfacial water possesses the properties of a liquid, and water molecules, ions and solutes are freely mobile in this zone (e.g., Ducros and Dupont, 1962; Graham et al., 1964; Hecht et al., 1966; Hoekstra and Chamberlain, 1964; Hoekstra, 1965). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra show decreasing, but significant molecular mobility down to -40° C. Although it was once claimed that anomalous ice phases might exist in frozen soil, in all instances so far reported the ice formed is normal, hexagonal ice I (Anderson and Hoekstra, 1965 a).},

Determining the microbial composition in patients and healthy controls may thus provide novel therapeutic targets.

We have employed 454-pyrosequencing of a hyper-variable region of the 16S rRNA gene in combination with sample-specific barcode sequences which enables parallel in-depth analysis of hundreds of samples with limited sample processing.  In silico  modeling demonstrated that the method correctly describes microbial communities down to phylotypes below the genus level. Here we applied the technique to analyze microbial communities in throat, stomach and fecal samples. Our results demonstrate the applicability of barcoded pyrosequencing as a high-throughput method for comparative microbial ecology.},

The samples were also analysed for basic hydrographical variables. Bacterial counts varied from 2.1 to 9.7 x 10(5) cells ml(-1) and bacterial production varied from 4.6 to 126.6 ng C L-1 h(-1). Spatial distribution of nitrate, chlorophyll a, bacterial abundance and bacterial activity showed areas of water fertilization in the oligotrophic Atlantic Ocean. Statistical analysis of data characterized the division of the area in two by latitude 19degreesS. On the north fertilizations are related to river discharge and on the south to the input of nutrients from deep waters. Remobilisation of nutrients in those spots results among all in higher biological activity. However the relation between bacterial abundance and activity is top-down controlled characterizing most of the waters as oligotrophic. Eddies showed by bacterial data can probably sustain the fisheries resources for the whole area. The influence of gradients across eddies on biological activity and food chain structure should be an important question to be studied in oligotrophic oceans.},

  abstract = {Denitrifying biofilters can remove agricultural nitrates from subsurface drainage, reducing nitrate pollution that contributes to coastal hypoxic zones. The performance and reliability of natural and engineered systems dependent upon microbially mediated processes, such as the denitrifying biofilters, can be affected by the spatial structure of their microbial communities. Furthermore, our understanding of the relationship between microbial community composition and function is influenced by the spatial distribution of samples. In this study we characterized the spatial structure of bacterial communities in a denitrifying biofilter in central Illinois. Bacterial communities were assessed using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis for bacteria and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of nosZ for denitrifying bacteria. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) analyses indicated that bacteria showed statistically significant spatial structure by depth and transect, while denitrifying bacteria did not exhibit significant spatial structure. For determination of spatial patterns, we developed a package of automated functions for the R statistical environment that allows directional analysis of microbial community composition data using either ANOSIM or Mantel statistics. Applying this package to the biofilter data, the flow path correlation range for the bacterial community was 6.4 m at the shallower, periodically inundated depth and 10.7 m at the deeper, continually submerged depth. These spatial structures suggest a strong influence of hydrology on the microbial community composition in these denitrifying biofilters. Understanding such spatial structure can also guide optimal sample collection strategies for microbial community analyses.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This paper reviews knowledge of biodiversity in open ocean pelagic communities and discusses the possible causal factors for the patterns. The oceanic pelagic ecosystem is by far the largest on Earth and, although locally its assemblages may be as rich as many terrestrial ecosystems, its global diversity (at both a species and an ecosystem level) is low. There are latitudinal trends in pelagic species diversity similar to those in many terrestrial taxa. High species richness in the oceans, however, tends to be associated with regions of low productivity that lack strong seasonality in the production cycle. The richest zones occur at the boundaries between different types of oceanic water where different faunas are mixed together, but the geographical locations of these boundaries are unstable and shift seasonally by hundreds of kilometers. If high diversity is emphasized in the development of protocols for conservation, then not only will the oceans receive low priority in conservation and resource management, but the regions most important in terms of process will also be overlooked. The scales of oceanic systems are so large that the methodologies developed for terrestrial conservation and resource management are inapplicable. Biodiversity may be regarded as the principal criterion for developing management strategies, yet the links (if any) between the ecological processes in the ocean that play such an important role in global homeostasis remain poorly characterized. The basis for a predictive understanding of the interaction between diversity and ecological process can be greatly enhanced relatively inexpensively by systematically collating existing data and working up extant collections of material},

  abstract = {Spatial distribution, community composition and trophic roles of micronekton (crustaceans, fishes and squids) were investigated in the Indian South Subtropical Gyre (ISSG) province and the East African Coastal province (EAFR), by combining acoustic surveys, mid-water trawls and stable isotope analyses from scientific cruises conducted in 2009 and 2010. Mesopelagic micronekton performed diel vertical migrations in both provinces, from deep (400–740 m) to surface (0–200 m) layers at dusk and in the opposite direction at dawn, with some species migrating below 740 m. The EAFR province was more dynamic than the oligotrophic ISSG province, with enhanced eddy activity and enhanced yearly productivity. The active enrichment mechanisms in the EAFR, in terms of available primary production, led to high micronekton acoustic density (as a proxy of micronekton abundance) and large micronekton weight and abundance estimates from trawl data. Particulate organic matter in the EAFR exhibited greater enrichment in 13C and 15N compared to the ISSG and, consequently, tissues of selected micronekton organisms in the EAFR were more enriched in 15N (higher δ15N values). In both provinces, micronekton encompassed a wide range of isotopic niches, with large overlaps between species. Micronekton and swordfish in the EAFR had an overlapping range of δ15N values, contrasting with the ISSG province where swordfish were two trophic levels higher than the sampled micronekton. Our results provide some evidence that the combined action of riverine input and the dynamics of eddies might influence productivity in the EAFR, and hence the abundance of micronekton and the enrichment of tissues in 15N, compared to the oligotrophic ISSG province.},

The OMZ was the most dramatic feature of the water column and seemed to determine the extent of migration: Stylocheiron affine migrated only to the shallow oxycline; whereas Euphausia mucronata, Euphausia eximia, Euphausia distinguenda and Euphausia tenera migrated to the core of the OMZ; and Nematoscelis gracilis to beneath the core of the OMZ. Some differences were also found in the timing and duration of the ascent and descent, and residence times in shallow and deep layers. E. mucronata, N. gracilis and E. distinguenda displayed a normal descent during sunrise, and ascent during sunset. E. eximia and E. tenera also descended during sunrise but seemed to begin their ascent earlier in the afternoon and consequently shortened their deep residence times. S. affine showed the most extended residence times at the shallow layer and the shortest vertical displacement. Day and night vertical stratification and differences in the timing of migration into and out of the OMZ of the HCE suggest a community structure based on habitat partitioning whereby species avoided co-occurrence in time and space. Species-specific patterns of vertical stratification and migratory chronology are examined with regard to body and gill sizes, feeding adaptations of euphausiids, and potential food resources at the OMZ.},

In our model, phytoplankton are limited in their growth by light and phosphorus, and bacteria are limited in their growth by phosphorus and carbon released from phytoplankton. We adopted 'permanence' as a criterion of the coexistence in mathematical analysis, and led necessary conditions of permanence in the model. Under these coexistence conditions, we estimated the strength of total effects of interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria at the steady state by press perturbation method. The results of this estimation indicated the mutualistic interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria. This suggests that mutualistic situation could occur due to the introduction of carbon flow from phytoplankton to bacteria, even if phytoplankton and bacteria compete with each other through common resource, inorganic phosphorus.},

  abstract = {Background Bacterial community composition in the marine environment differs from one geographical location to another. Reports that delineate the bacterial diversity of different marine samples from geographically similar location are limited. The present study aims to understand whether the bacterial community compositions from different marine samples harbour similar bacterial diversity since these are geographically related to each other. Methods and Principal Findings In the present study, 16S rRNA deep sequencing analysis targeting V3 region was performed using Illumina bar coded sequencing. A total of 22.44 million paired end reads were obtained from the metagenomic DNA of Marine sediment, Rhizosphere sediment, Seawater and the epibacterial DNA of Seaweed and Seagrass. Diversity index analysis revealed that Marine sediment has the highest bacterial diversity and the least bacterial diversity was observed in Rhizosphere sediment. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant taxa present in all the marine samples. Nearly 62–71\% of rare species were identified in all the samples and most of these rare species were unique to a particular sample. Further taxonomic assignment at the phylum and genus level revealed that the bacterial community compositions differ among the samples. Conclusion This is the first report that supports the fact that, bacterial community composition is specific for specific samples irrespective of its similar geographical location. Existence of specific bacterial community for each sample may drive overall difference in bacterial structural composition of each sample. Further studies like whole metagenomic sequencing will throw more insights to the key stone players and its interconnecting metabolic pathways. In addition, this is one of the very few reports that depicts the unexplored bacterial diversity of marine samples (Marine sediment, Rhizosphere sediment, Seawater) and the host associated marine samples (Seaweed and Seagrass) at higher depths from uncharacterised coastal region of Palk Bay, India using next generation sequencing technology.},

  abstract = {One pathway of the biological pump that remains largely unquantified in many export models is the active transport of carbon from the surface ocean to the mesopelagic by zooplankton diel vertical migration (DVM). Here, we develop a simple representation of zooplankton DVM and implement it in a global export model as a thought experiment to illustrate the effects of DVM on carbon export and mesopelagic biogeochemistry. The model is driven by diagnostic satellite measurements of net primary production, algal biomass, and phytoplankton size structure. Due to constraints on available satellite data, the results are restricted to the latitude range from 60°N to 60°S. The modeled global export flux from the base of the euphotic zone was 6.5 PgC/year, which represents a 14\% increase over the export flux in model runs without DVM. The mean (± standard deviation, SD) proportional contribution of the DVM-mediated export flux to total carbon export, averaged over the global domain and the climatological seasonal cycle, was 0.16 ± 0.04 and the proportional contribution of DVM activity to total respiration within the twilight zone was 0.16 ± 0.06. Adding DVM activity to the model also resulted in a deep local maximum in the oxygen utilization profile. The model results were most sensitive to the assumptions for the fraction of individuals participating in DVM, the fraction of fecal pellets produced in the euphotic zone, and the fraction of grazed carbon that is metabolized.},

  abstract = {The pelagic realm of the dark ocean represents a key site for remineralization of organic matter and long-term carbon storage and burial in the biosphere. It contains the largest pool of microbes in aquatic systems, harboring nearly 75\% and 50\% of the prokaryotic biomass and production, respectively, of the global ocean. Genomic approaches continue to uncover the enormous and dynamic genetic variability at phylogenetic and functional levels. Deep-sea prokaryotes have comparable or even higher cell-specific extracellular enzymatic activity than do microbes in surface waters, with a high fraction of freely released exoenzymes, probably indicative of a life mode reliant on surface attachment to particles or colloids. Additionally, evidence increases that chemoautotrophy might represent a significant CO(2) sink and source of primary production in the dark ocean. Recent advances challenge the paradigm of stable microbial food web structure and function and slow organic-matter cycling. However, knowledge of deep-ocean food webs is still rudimentary. Dynamics of particle transformation and fate of the exported material in deep waters are still largely unknown. Discrepancies exist between estimates of carbon fluxes and remineralization rates. Recent assessments, however, suggest that integrated respiration in the dark ocean's water column is comparable to that in the epipelagic zone, and that the dark ocean is a site of paramount importance for material cycling in the biosphere. The advent of new molecular tools and in situ sampling methodologies will improve knowledge of the dark ocean's microbial ecosystem and resolve current discrepancies between carbon sources and metabolic requirements of deep-sea microbes.},

The relative contributions of different interaction forces to adsorption and their dependence on the physicochemical properties of the viruses remain, however, only poorly understood. Herein, we systematically studied the adsorption of four bacteriophages (MS2, fr, GA, and Qβ) to five model surfaces with varying surface chemistries and to three dissolved organic matter adlayers, as a function of solution pH and ionic strength, using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. The viruses were selected to have similar sizes and shapes but different surface charges, polarities, and topographies, as identified by modeling the distributions of amino acids in the virus capsids. Virus-sorbent interactions were governed by long-ranged electrostatics and favorable contributions from the hydrophobic effect, and shorter-ranged van der Waals interactions were of secondary importance. Steric effects depended on the topographic irregularities on both the virus and sorbent surfaces. Differences in the adsorption characteristics of the tested viruses were successfully linked to differences in their capsid surface properties. Besides identifying the major interaction forces, this work highlights the potential of computable virus surface charge and polarity descriptors to predict virus adsorption to solid−water interfaces.},

A major assumption of these methods is that the signs and magnitudes of species interactions and vital rates can be reliably parsed from observational data on species’ (relative) abundances. However, we contend that this assumption is violated when sample units contain any underlying spatial structure. Here, we show how three phenomena—Simpson’s paradox, context-dependence, and nonlinear averaging—can lead to erroneous conclusions about population parameters and species interactions when samples contain heterogeneous mixtures of populations or communities. At the root of this issue is the fundamental mismatch between the spatial scales of species interactions (micrometers) and those of typical microbial community samples (millimeters to centimetres). These issues can be overcome by measuring and accounting for spatial heterogeneity at very small scales, which will lead to more reliable inference of the ecological mechanisms structuring natural microbial communities.},

What makes these compounds so resistant to microbial degradation? Perhaps their chemical structures make them intrinsically difficult to metabolize? In contrast, Arrieta et al. show that they are simply too dilute to be viable sources of energy for microorganisms (see the Perspective by Middleburg). Further experiments show that if these seemingly recalcitrant organic molecules are concentrated, the ambient microbes can consume them. Science, this issue p. 331; see also p. 290 Oceanic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the second largest reservoir of organic carbon in the biosphere. About 72\% of the global DOC inventory is stored in deep oceanic layers for years to centuries, supporting the current view that it consists of materials resistant to microbial degradation. An alternative hypothesis is that deep-water DOC consists of many different, intrinsically labile compounds at concentrations too low to compensate for the metabolic costs associated to their utilization. Here, we present experimental evidence showing that low concentrations rather than recalcitrance preclude consumption of a substantial fraction of DOC, leading to slow microbial growth in the deep ocean. These findings demonstrate an alternative mechanism for the long-term storage of labile DOC in the deep ocean, which has been hitherto largely ignored.},

  abstract = {Since 1972, herpes-like virus infections have been reported in several marine bivalve species around the world. Viral detection was often associated with high mortality rates in larvae and spat. To determine whether a single virus is able to infect different bivalve host species, we carried out experimental transmission assays. As a first step, 8 assays were performed to infect axenic Crassostrea gigas larvae with virus from infected C. gigas larvae using a previously described protocol. The protocol appeared reliable and PCR was confirmed as a powerful technique for detecting viral DNA in experimentally infected oysters. The defined protocol was then applied to infect different bivalve species. Interspecies viral transmission was demonstrated under laboratory conditions. The same phenomenon may occur in private hatcheries and may be promoted by intensive rearing conditions. This hypothesis is reinforced by reports of concomitant mortalities in the larvae of several bivalve species and by the first molecular analysis of infected larval samples.},

Characteristic amplicons representing the human noroviruses (213bp) and enteroviruses (196bp) were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) employing specific primers.

  abstract = {This study follows an ethnically and economically diverse sample of 33 high school students to explore why some who were once very interested in science, engineering, or medicine (SEM) majors or careers decided to leave the pipeline in high school while others persisted. Through longitudinal interviews and surveys, students shared narratives about their developing science identities, SEM participation and aspirations. In analysis, three groups emerged (High Achieving Persisters, Low Achieving Persisters, and Lost Potentials), each experiencing different interactions and experiences within science communities of practice in and outside of school and within the extended family. These different microclimates framed students' perceptions of their SEM study, abilities, career options, and expected success, thereby shaping their science identities and consequent SEM trajectories. School science was often hard and discouraging; there were very few science advocates at school or home; and meaningful opportunities to work with real science professionals were scarce, even in schools with science or health academies. Students expressed positive attitudes toward science and non-science pursuits where they experienced success and received support from important people in their lives. Results underscore the key role communities of practice play in career and identity development and suggest a need for interventions to help socializers better understand the value and purpose of science literacy themselves so as to encourage students to appreciate science, be aware of possible career options in science and enjoy learning and doing science. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {This study has two main objectives: (1) to implement a recycling aquaculture system (RS) for the larvae of the oyster Crassostrea gigas, and (2) to characterise the bacterial communities established in different compartments of this system. An RS with 25\% fresh seawater addition per hour and another with no addition (0\%) were compared with a flow-through system (FT). Larval survival was equivalent in RS and FT, but growth rate was 17\% slower in RS than in FT. The physical chemical parameters remained stable, except for pH that decreased to 7.75 and salinity that increased to 37.5‰ in the RS 0\%. In both systems, the cultivable bacteria were present in similar numbers in seawater (around 105ml−1) and in larvae (103 larva−1) on day 15. Bacterial assemblages, characterised by 454 pyrosequencing of the V1–V3 region of 16S rRNA, were highly similar (50–65\%) for compartments, regardless of rearing system and sampling time, but the compartments were clearly different from one another. At the beginning of rearing, larval microbiota was mostly composed of Proteobacteria (\textasciitilde 90\%), with 47\% Rhodobacteraceae (α-Proteobacteria). γ-Proteobacteria, including Pseudoalteromonas, Alteromonas and a few vibrios, declined in the rearing period (25\% on day 7 to 9\% on day 15). At the end of rearing, colonisation by two members of the Burkholderiales (β-Proteobacteria), 45\% on average on day 15, had decreased overall diversity. Seawater microbiota was more stable with in all batches as one unclassified bacterium present in all batches (27±7\%), 42 OTUs of α-Proteobacteria (19±7\%) and 26 of γ-Proteobacteria (14\%). Change was due notably to a species of Cryomorphaceae (Flavobacteria) that reached 15±7\% on day 15. Predatory bacteria, Bdellovivrio spp. and Bacteriovorax spp. were present (3–12\%) and could participate in the regulation of bacterial populations. Bacterial assemblages in RS bioreactors remained stable and were mainly composed of Rhodobacteraceae, Rhizobiales and Planctomycetes. Only a few nitrite oxidisers were detected and no ammonia oxidisers, although nitrification was efficient in RS without addition of new water. The larval microbiota was made up of bacteria growing in seawater, but some such as the Burkholderiales could have come from the broodstock. Several bacteria predominant in seawater were first harboured in the algal culture. Finally, despite sanitary measures in the hatchery (UV treatment and frequent cleaning), the diversity of microbiota remained high, and it did not contain pathogenic bacteria. The presence of this microbiota might even be indispensable to ensure normal ontogenesis, as suggested by the holobiont concept. Statement of relevance RAS and control of microbiota should improve bivalve larval culture},

Aggregate abundance, size and potential sinking rates were determined by photographic techniques. Measurements of water column parameters, including particulate organic carbon concentrations, were assessed simultaneously, as was the flux of organic matter with floating sediment traps. The numbers of aggregates (and to a lesser extent their size) increased with time, although there was substantial spatial variability in these variables at any point in time. Some aggregates appeared to sink extremely rapidly, and for these, our photographic measurements were able to estimate only a minimum sinking rate, which equaled 288 m d−1. Estimates of aggregate organic carbon flux were compared to those determined by floating sediment traps. From these results, aggregate fluxes appear to have dominated the vertical export of organic matter from the euphotic zone. The genesis and flux of aggregates in the Ross Sea are the critical processes controlling the export of biogenic material from the surface layer.},

Results at this site indicate that essentially all settling particles arrive at the sea floor as components of large aggregates, with insignificant contributions of solitary fecal pellets. The observed flux of any particle divided by its concentration gives an estimate of a model parameter which can be interpreted as particle settling speed. Application of this method to marine snow indicates that, on average, larger aggregates (4–5 mm) settle more slowly (1 m day−1) than smaller aggregates (1–2.5 mm, 36 m day-1). These sinking speed estimates represent the average sinking speed of all aggregates photographed in the water column at the depth of the sediment trap. As such, these numbers may reflect the relative abundances of fast and slow-sinking aggregates rather than the absolute sinking speed of material entering the trap. Particles were observed to change positions or disappear between photographs, indicating water movement which may have been associated with the activity of grazing organisms within the sediment trap.},

In order to gain insight into the organization and structure of the resultant large complex networks formed by the interacting molecules, we have developed the versatile Cytoscape plugin NetworkAnalyzer. It computes and displays a comprehensive set of topological parameters, which includes the number of nodes, edges, and connected components, the network diameter, radius, density, centralization, heterogeneity, and clustering coefficient, the characteristic path length, and the distributions of node degrees, neighborhood connectivities, average clustering coefficients, and shortest path lengths. NetworkAnalyzer can be applied to both directed and undirected networks and also contains extra functionality to construct the intersection or union of two networks. It is an interactive and highly customizable application that requires no expert knowledge in graph theory from the user.

  abstract = {Viruses are fundamental components of marine microbial communities that significantly influence oceanic productivity, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem processes. Despite their importance, the temporal activities and dynamics of viral assemblages in natural settings remain largely unexplored. Here we report the transcriptional activities and variability of dominant dsDNA viruses in the open ocean’s euphotic zone over daily and seasonal timescales. While dsDNA viruses exhibited some fluctuation in abundance in both cellular and viral size fractions, the viral assemblage was remarkably stable, with the most abundant viral types persisting over many days. More extended time series indicated that long-term persistence ({$>$}1 y) was the rule for most dsDNA viruses observed, suggesting that both core viral genomes as well as viral community structure were conserved over interannual periods. Viral gene transcription in host cell assemblages revealed diel cycling among many different viral types. Most notably, an afternoon peak in cyanophage transcriptional activity coincided with a peak in Prochlorococcus DNA replication, indicating coordinated diurnal coupling of virus and host reproduction. In aggregate, our analyses suggested a tightly synchronized diel coupling of viral and cellular replication cycles in both photoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacterial hosts. A surprising consequence of these findings is that diel cycles in the ocean’s photic zone appear to be universal organizing principles that shape ecosystem dynamics, ecological interactions, and biogeochemical cycling of both cellular and acellular community components.},

In the euphotic zone, bacterial carbon demand was generally equivalent to 30-60\% of the primary production. Below the upper mixed layer, bacterial carbon demand was calculated to be equivalent to a major fraction (greater-than-or-equal-to 80\%) of the depth-dissipation of sinking carbon. Since bacteria contribute substantially to the POC pool and its dynamics, the role of bacteria as organic particles should be taken into account in studies of the biogeochemical and optical behavior of particulate carbon in the sea. Our measurements of concentrations and bacterial utilization of dissolved free (DFAA) and dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA) have lead to the realization of a virtual uncoupling between bacteria and DCAA at depths below approximately 200m. The DCAA pool was quite large (554-1057nM glycine equivalents) and did not vary much with depth. Despite the presence of a large DCAA pool bacterial carbon demand was very low. Even if DCAA were the only pool of utilizable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) bacterial turnover time of DCAA pool would be on the order of 10(4)d (compared with {$<$}10d in the surface waters). Calculations for the SMB show bacterial surface area to be the dominant biotic surface area, suggesting bacteria may play an important role in radionuclide biodynamics. In view of the quantitative significance of material flow through the microbial loop in SMB ecosystem, it is possible that protozoan predation on bacteria is a significant pathway for radionuclide remineralization and solubilization.},

Organic matter flux into bacteria is highly variable, which can significantly influence the pathways of carbon flow in the ocean. A goal for future research is to elucidate the mechanistic bases of bacteria-organic matter coupling. This research should take into consideration the micrometer-scale distribution of bacteria and the composition, structure, and dynamics of the organic matter field in the bacterium's microhabitat. The ideas on the interactions of bacteria with the particulate organic phase need to be revised in view of recent findings of highly abundant, previously unknown particles ranging in size from nanometers to hundreds of micrometers. The `'hot-spots” in the distribution of organic matter and remineralized nutrients can influence the rates as well as the direction of biogeochemical fluxes. Slow-to-degrade dissolved organic matter (DOM) may be produced because of loose bacteria-organic matter coupling resulting in DON storage. Its use at a later time and place has profound implications for carbon fluxes and food web dynamics. A fundamental research need for the future is to understand the ecological interactions among the members of the microbial loop in an appropriate microhabitat context. While this goal was previously intractable, new molecular and optical techniques should make it possible to understand the biogeochemical activities of the microbial loop in terms of the ecology and evolution of pelagic microbial communities.},

Here, we stress the need to examine the biochemical interactions of microorganisms with ocean systems at the nanometre to millimetre scale — a scale that is relevant to microbial activities. The local impact of microorganisms on biogeochemical cycles must then be scaled up to make useful predictions of how marine ecosystems in the whole ocean might respond to global change. This approach to microbial oceanography is not only helpful, but is in fact indispensable.},

  abstract = {The high abundance of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) in marine and freshwater greatly affects particle dynamics. TEP act as glue for colliding particles and form the matrix in aggregates, thereby altering aggregation dynamics. We studied the sinking behavior of freshly produced, particle?free TEP and of aggregates composed of TEP and latex spheres in a laboratory using water collected from Santa Barbara Channel, California. Particle?free TEP ascend and accumulate in the surface layer of a settling column at an average velocity of 1.6 x 10?4 cm s?1. The estimated density of TEP ranges from 0.70 to 0.84 g cm?3. TEP also transported latex spheres of 45.6 and 1.82 µm in diameter and a density of 1.05 g cm?3 to the surface layer. We describe a simple model illustrating the role of TEP for the vertical transport of solid particles. The densities and relative proportions of TEP, solid particles, and interstitial water within an aggregate determine its sinking or ascending velocity. High ratios of TEP to solid particles retard the sinking of aggregates, prolonging their residence time in the surface ocean. Our results demonstrate that TEP can provide a vehicle for the upward flux of biological and chemical components in the marine environment, including bacteria, phytoplankton, carbon, and reactive trace elements.},

  abstract = {The flux of fixed nitrogen into the marine environment is increasing as a direct result of anthropogenic nitrogen loading, but the controls on the mechanisms responsible for the removal of this increased supply are not well constrained. The fate of fixed nitrogen via mineralization and nitrogen loss processes was investigated by simulating a settling event of organic matter (OM) in mesocosms containing Chesapeake Bay sediments. Microorganisms rapidly transformed the OM during the course of a seven week incubation ultimately leading to nitrogen loss via denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). The microbial community responded quickly to the OM amendment suggesting that estuarine sediments can buffer the natural system against sudden injections of organic material. Two different levels of organic matter amendment resulted in different magnitudes of ammonium and nitrite accumulation during the incubation, but both treatments exhibited the same overall sequence of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) accumulation and removal. An inverse least-squares analysis coupled to a Michaelis−Menten prognostic model was conducted to estimate rates of nitrogen transformations from the measured DIN concentrations. Whereas the rates were higher at higher OM, the percentage of nitrogen lost via anammox was constant at 44.3 ± 0.3\%. The stoichiometry of organic matter and the allochthonous supply of ammonium determined the relative contribution of anammox and denitrification to overall nitrogen loss. Further, in situ thermodynamics based on measured concentrations suggested that the energy favorability of denitrification and anammox plays a role in determining the timing of these processes as OM remineralization progresses.},

  abstract = {Understanding N Loss Biologically available nitrogen (N) is essential for marine plants, and shortage of N limits photosynthesis. Marine N can be removed by denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) processes, but what controls the balance between these two pathways? Babbin et al. (p. 406, published online 10 April) tested the effects of stoichiometry on N removal in the lab and found that the balance of N loss processes depends on the stoichiometry of the source organic material. Biologically available nitrogen limits photosynthesis in much of the world ocean. Organic matter (OM) stoichiometry had been thought to control the balance between the two major nitrogen removal pathways—denitrification and anammox—but the expected proportion of 30\% anammox derived from mean oceanic OM is rarely observed in the environment. With incubations designed to directly test the effects of stoichiometry, however, we showed that the ratio of anammox to denitrification depends on the stoichiometry of OM supply, as predicted. Furthermore, observed rates of nitrogen loss increase with the magnitude of OM supply. The variable ratios between denitrification and anammox previously observed in the ocean are thus attributable to localized variations in OM quality and quantity and do not necessitate a revision to the global nitrogen cycle. The variable ratio of denitrification to anammox in the ocean is due to variations in organic matter quality and quantity.

  abstract = {About 50\,Gt of carbon is fixed photosynthetically by surface ocean phytoplankton communities every year. Part of this organic matter is reprocessed within the plankton community to form aggregates which eventually sink and export carbon into the deep ocean. The fraction of organic matter leaving the surface ocean is partly dependent on aggregate sinking velocity which accelerates with increasing aggregate size and density, where the latter is controlled by ballast load and aggregate porosity. In May 2011, we moored nine 25\,m deep mesocosms in a Norwegian fjord to assess on a daily basis how plankton community structure affects material properties and sinking velocities of aggregates (Ø 80–400\,µm) collected in the mesocosms' sediment traps. We noted that sinking velocity was not necessarily accelerated by opal ballast during diatom blooms, which could be due to relatively high porosity of these rather fresh aggregates. Furthermore, estimated aggregate porosity (Pestimated) decreased as the picoautotroph (0.2–2\,µm) fraction of the phytoplankton biomass increased. Thus, picoautotroph-dominated communities may be indicative for food webs promoting a high degree of aggregate repackaging with potential for accelerated sinking. Blooms of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi revealed that cell concentrations of \textasciitilde 1500\,cells/mL accelerate sinking by about 35–40\%, which we estimate (by one-dimensional modeling) to elevate organic matter transfer efficiency through the mesopelagic from 14 to 24\%. Our results indicate that sinking velocities are influenced by the complex interplay between the availability of ballast minerals and aggregate packaging; both of which are controlled by plankton community structure.},

  abstract = {This paper is the first of a series describing the vertical distribution of midwater fishes in the eastern North Atlantic in areas approximately 10° of latitude apart near the 20° meridian. As such, it is concerned solely with collections made in 30°N, 23°W. The results are based primarily upon RMT 8 net samples collected using an opening-closing RMT 1+8 combination net. In all, 17,443 specimens were caught by RMT 8, divisible into 37 families, 66 genera with 98 species identified. Numerically the most abundant groups recognized were the Gonostomatidae (60\% total catch), Macrorhamphosidae (23\%) and Myctophidae (7\%). Some definition of vertical limits is provided for the majority of species represented, but only 31 are considered in detail. Where possible, observed biological phenomena (e.g. development, sexual maturity, sexual dimorphism, etc.) and distribution limits have been correlated. In general, the characteristics of species' distributions, and the observed relations of distribution and migratory behaviour were as one would anticipate from past work. Among many species, a size-depth stratification was observed, and with migrants, migratory behaviour appeared dependent upon developmental state. The mode of species development, however, had no bearing upon ultimate migratory behaviour. Certain non-migratory elements of the population of an habitually migrant species, e.g. Chauliodus danae, could not be satisfactorily interpreted upon the basis of biological factors examines. Migrant species principally occupied 400–900 m depth by day, and 25–300 m by night, although they occurred at greater depths. Reverse migrations were only observed in Macrorhamphosus. The overall catches were dominated by non-migrants, and at depths greater that 200 m these comprised the most abundant species per depth at all times. Cyclothone constituted the most abundant genus sampled and provided greatest insight into distributional and biological detail. C. braueri, the most numerous species, is probably a single spawner, and the results demonstrate a size-depth stratification that may be correlated with sexual maturity stages. The olfactory structure in males is more complicated than previously described. The larger males develop a snout prolongation which would improve water flow through the nasal rosette and hence olfaction. Unlike C. microdon, C. braueri probably does not undergo sex-reversal. Developmental notes are included for the myctophid species Notoscopelus resplendens, Benthosema suborbitale, and Hygophum hygomi in the Appendix.},

  abstract = {Many freshwater phytoplankton species have the potential to form transient nuisance blooms that affect water quality and other aquatic biota. Heterotrophic bacteria can influence such blooms via nutrient regeneration but also via antagonism and other biotic interactions. We studied the composition of bacterial communities associated with three bloom-forming freshwater phytoplankton species, the diatom Aulacoseira granulata and the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. Experimental cultures incubated with and without lake bacteria were sampled in three different growth phases and bacterial community composition was assessed by 454-Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Betaproteobacteria were dominant in all cultures inoculated with lake bacteria, but decreased during the experiment. In contrast, Alphaproteobacteria, which made up the second most abundant class of bacteria, increased overall during the course of the experiment. Other bacterial classes responded in contrasting ways to the experimental incubations causing significantly different bacterial communities to develop in response to host phytoplankton species, growth phase and between attached and free-living fractions. Differences in bacterial community composition between cyanobacteria and diatom cultures were greater than between the two cyanobacteria. Despite the significance, major differences between phytoplankton cultures were in the proportion of the OTUs rather than in the absence or presence of specific taxa. Different phytoplankton species favoring different bacterial communities may have important consequences for the fate of organic matter in systems where these bloom forming species occur. The dynamics and development of transient blooms may also be affected as bacterial communities seem to influence phytoplankton species growth in contrasting ways.},

  abstract = {Bacteria play fundamental roles for many ecosystem processes; however, little empirical evidence is available on how environmental perturbations affect their composition and function. We investigated how spatial and temporal refuges affect the resistance and resilience of a freshwater bacterioplankton community upon a salinity pulse perturbation in continuous cultures. Attachment to a surface avoided the flushing out of cells and enabled re-colonization of the liquid phase after the perturbation, hence serving as a temporal refuge. A spatial refuge was established by introduction of bacteria from an undisturbed reservoir upstream of the continuous culture vessel, acting analogous to a regional species pool in a metacommunity. The salinity pulse affected bacterial community composition and the rates of respiration and the pattern of potential substrate utilization as well as the correlation between composition and function. Compared with the no-refuge treatment, the temporal refuge shortened return to pre-perturbation conditions, indicating enhanced community resilience. Composition and function were less disturbed in the treatment providing a spatial refuge, suggesting higher resistance. Our results highlight that spatial and temporal dynamics in general and refuges in particular need to be considered for conceptual progress in how microbial metacommunities are shaped by perturbations.},

  abstract = {Soil macroaggregates are discrete, separable units of soil that we hypothesize contain smaller assemblages of microorganisms than bulk soil, and represent a scale potentially consistent with naturally occurring microbial communities. We posed two questions to explore microbial community composition in the context of the macroaggregate: 1) Is there a relationship between macroaggregate physical structure and microbial community composition in individual macroaggregates? And, 2) How similar are the bacterial communities in individual sub-millimeter soil macroaggregates sampled from the same 5-cm core? To address these questions, individual macroaggregates of three arbitrary size classes (250–425, 425–841, and 841–1000~μm) were sampled from a grassland field. The physical structures of~14 individual macroaggregates were characterized using synchrotron-radiation based transmission X-ray tomography, revealing that a greater proportion of the pore space in the small- and medium-sized macroaggregates is as relatively smaller pores, resulting in greater overall porosity and pore–mineral interface area in these smaller macroaggregates. Microbial community composition was characterized using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing data. Rarefaction analyses indicated that the membership of each macroaggregate was sufficiently sampled with only a few thousand sequences; in addition, the community membership varied widely between macroaggregates and the structure varied from those communities strongly dominated by a few phylotypes to communities that were evenly distributed among several phylotypes. We found no strong relationship of physical structure with community membership; this may be due to the low number of aggregates (10) for which we have both physical and biological data. Our results do support our initial expectation that individual macroaggregate communities were significantly less diverse than bulk soil from the same grassland field site.},

  abstract = {As in other eutrophied estuaries and coastal embayments, persistent hypoxia now routinely develops during summer in the mesohaline portion of the Neuse River estuary (North Carolina, USA). In response to interannual differences in hydrography, summer 1997 exhibited much more intense and widespread hypoxia than summer 1998, permitting inferences about impacts of hypoxia on food web dynamics by comparing system changes across these two summers. The trophic structure of the Neuse estuary now resembles the generic pattern for a degraded temperate estuary with (1) intense planktonic algal blooms and similarly high production of free-living bacteria, (2) trivial levels of abundance of rooted aquatic plants and benthic macroalgae, (3) depleted apex predators, and (4) functional extinction of the historically dominant benthic grazer, eastern oysters. Detailed carbon-flow models, based on comprehensive field data, demonstrated large differences between the two summers in trophic transfers and system dynamics. Largely because of greater mortality of benthic invertebrates from more intense hypoxia, total biomass of heterotrophs declined over summer by 51\% in 1997 as compared to only 17\% in 1998. Because net primary production increased over summer and herbivory in this system is predominantly benthic, the fraction of primary production consumed by herbivores declined over summer by 35\% in 1997 and 29\% in 1998. Influx of juvenile fishes and their rapid growth in the estuarine nursery over summer led to increases in energy demand by demersal fishes of 380\% and 507\% in the successive summers. Thus, hypoxia-enhanced diversion of energy flows into microbial pathways away from consumers and mass mortality of benthic invertebrates from bottom hypoxia occurred at the season of greatest demand by predatory fishes and crabs using the estuary as nursery. Average residence time of carbon in the ecosystem declined by 51\% in 1997 and 29\% in 1998. Total system throughput declined over summer 1997 while increasing in 1998, indicating the reduced capacity of the system to transfer carbon to higher trophic levels in the more hypoxic summer. Late-summer trophic pathways were characterized by greater numbers of cycles, but flows became increasingly dominated by microbial loops rather than transfers to consumers. Ecosystem trophic efficiency was only \textasciitilde 4\%, lower than other estuaries similarly analyzed. System properties indicative of resiliency of system function including development capacity, ascendancy, and flow diversity declined over summer 1997, while increasing or declining less in 1998. Thus, intensification of hypoxia caused dramatic reduction in the ecosystem's ability to transfer energy to higher trophic levels and rendered the ecosystem potentially less resilient to other stressors.},

  abstract = {Several isolates of bacteria and fungi from soil, together with cells released directly from soil, were studied with respect to buoyant density and dry weight. The specific volume (cubic centimeters per gram) of wet cells as measured in density gradients of colloidal silica was correlated with the percent dry weight of the cells and found to be in general agreement with calculations based on the partial specific volume of major cell components. The buoyant density of pure bacterial cultures ranged from 1.035 to 1.093 g/cm3, and their dry-matter content ranged from 12 to 33\% (wt/wt). Average values proposed for the conversion of bacterial biovolume into biomass dry weight are 1.09 g/cm3 and 30\% dry matter. Fungal hyphae had buoyant densities ranging from 1.08 to 1.11 g/cm3, and their dry-matter content ranged from 18 to 25\% (wt/wt). Average values proposed for the conversion of hyphal biovolume into biomass dry weight are 1.09 g/cm3 and 21\% dry matter. Three of the bacterial isolates were found to have cell capsules. The calculated buoyant density and percent dry weight of these capsules varied from 1.029 g/cm3 and 7\% dry weight to 1.084 g/cm3 and 44\% dry weight. The majority of the fungi were found to produce large amounts of extracellular material when grown in liquid cultures. This material was not produced when the fungi were grown on either sterile spruce needles or membrane filters on an agar surface. Fungal hyphae in litter were shown to be free from extracellular materials.},

During three trans-Atlantic cruises, we measured particle optical properties plus concentrations of the three major components of sinking aggregates [particulate organic carbon (POC), PIC and biogenic silica (BSi)]. PIC contributed 15–23\% of particle backscattering in oligotrophic subtropical gyres and temperate waters. Light scattering properties allowed quantification of the surface PIC:POC ratio. The ratio of the two ballast minerals (PIC:BSi) was significantly, inversely, correlated to POC concentration, allowing robust modeling of the density of sinking aggregates. Results showed greater PIC:POC ratios and sinking rates in oligotrophic regions due to greater relative abundance of PIC.},

Here we describe field observations and experiments from two cruises that crossed the GCB in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the SO. We confirm the presence of coccolithophores, their coccoliths, and associated optical scattering, located primarily in the region of the subtropical, Agulhas, and Subantarctic frontal regions. Coccolithophore-rich regions were typically associated with high-velocity frontal regions with higher seawater partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2) than the atmosphere, sufficient to reverse the direction of gas exchange to a CO2 source. There was no calcium carbonate (CaCO3) enhancement of particulate organic carbon (POC) export, but there were increased POC transfer efficiencies in high-flux particulate inorganic carbon regions. Contemporaneous observations are synthesized with results of trace-metal incubation experiments, 234Th-based flux estimates, and remotely sensed observations to generate a mandala that summarizes our understanding about the factors that regulate the location of the GCB.},

The eddy stations were compared with two far-field (FF) stations located also in the Canary Current, but outside the influence of the eddy field. The distribution of prokaryotic abundance (PA), bulk prokaryotic heterotrophic activity (PHA), various indicators of single-cell activity (such as nucleic acid content, proportion of live cells, and fraction of cells actively incorporating leucine), as well as bacterial and archaeal community structure were determined from the surface to 2000 m depth. In the upper epipelagic layer (0–200 m), the effect of eddies on the prokaryotic community was more apparent, as indicated by the higher PA, PHA, fraction of living cells, and percentage of active cells incorporating leucine within eddies than at FF stations. Prokaryotic community composition differed also between eddy and FF stations in the epipelagic layer. In the mesopelagic layer (200–1000 m), there were also significant differences in PA and PHA between eddy and FF stations, although in general, there were no clear differences in community composition or single-cell activity. The effects on prokaryotic activity and community structure were stronger in AE than CE, decreasing with depth in both types of eddies. Overall, both types of eddies show distinct community compositions (as compared with FF in the epipelagic), and represent oceanic ‘hotspots’ of prokaryotic activity (in the epi- and mesopelagic realms).},

  abstract = {Although bivalve shell formation is an area of active research, less attention has been paid to mechanisms of precipitation for shell features with unique or unusual crystal morphologies. One example is the chalky calcite deposits found in some bivalves, commonly oysters. The goal of this study was to investigate chalky deposit formation in oysters as a possible case of microbially influenced mineralization by seeking a correlation between the presence of chalky deposits and calcifying bacteria. Extrapallial fluid was collected from specimens of Crassostrea gigas and Ostrea lurida, which do and do not display chalky deposits, respectively. Microbial communities from oyster and seawater samples were characterized and compared using 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR and sequencing. Results indicate that microbial communities are dominated by the following bacterial phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Proteobacteria. In addition, seawater is the major source of the microbiome isolated from oyster calcifying fluid. In general, microbial communities in C. gigas are not skewed towards bacterial taxa known for influencing calcium carbonate precipitation in other systems. Although no evidence was found to support a microbial influence on chalk formation, this work provides additional data and insight into the growing body of research on invertebrate microbiomes.},

Zooplankton-mediated processes that lead from physically caused, nitrate-fueled new production to total primary production are emphasized. Under oligotrophic conditions, the rate of phytoplankton cell division in the light-saturated part of the euphotic zone depends directly on the rate of nutrient regeneration by the zooplankton; indirectly, it depends on the liberation of dissolved organic matter that provides the bacterial substrate, mainly from “sloppy” feeding of the zooplankton, excretion, and release from feces, and a small contribution from exudation by phytoplankton. The bacterial division rate is low and is inferred as being controlled by the supply rate of dissolved organic carbon. The possibility is discussed that, via nutrient regeneration, temperature-controlled zooplankton physiology largely controls the rate of phytoplankton production, given a physically set rate of new production. Phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions are treated briefly for the high nutrient-low chlorophyll regions that also have little temporal change of phytoplankton concentrations, and the open-sea regions with seasonal blooms. All available marine measurements \&gt;9°C of bulk phytoplankton division rates are plotted on temperature to improve upon Eppley's standard curve for modeling phytoplankton production.},

The relatively weak seasonality of the stable subtropical and tropical oceans in the global model enabled long exclusion time scales and prolonged coexistence of multiple phytoplankton with comparable fitness.

  abstract = {Core Ideas A project-based learning approach involves public expression of meaningful topics. A middle school science class with a scientist–teacher partnership used this method. Students expressed more positive science attitudes and confidence than peers. Analysis of public letters on an energy project found complex argument construction. This approach may increase science engagement in science policy issues. Increasing scientific literacy through education is one way to promote awareness of current environmental challenges, and can be enhanced through project-based learning (PBL), a pedagogical approach in which students explore authentic topics and demonstrate their learning publically. The National Science Foundation–funded GK–12 program at Iowa State University partnered doctoral-level graduate students (fellows) with middle and high school science teachers. This study analyzed results from one such middle school partnership in Iowa, where a PBL approach was implemented. Classroom practices focused on local environmental case studies of energy development, water pollution, soil science, climate change, plant biology, and ecology. Results from a student survey (n = 101), following a year with the PBL curricula, revealed significantly more positive attitudes and greater levels of engagement and confidence in scientific material relative to GK–12 peers (n = 329). Publicly submitted student letters to a government agency responsible for approving an oil pipeline project were also analyzed for scientific themes and levels of comprehension (n = 65). Overall, 60\% of students demonstrated the ability to construct arguments by citing specific data and scientific evidence in the letters, and also incorporated topics covered in previous units (4–5 themes addressed on average per letter).

  abstract = {Strict planetary protection practices are implemented during spacecraft assembly to prevent inadvertent transfer of earth microorganisms to other planetary bodies. Therefore, spacecraft are assembled in cleanrooms, which undergo strict cleaning and decontamination procedures to reduce total microbial bioburden. We wanted to evaluate if these practices selectively favor survival and growth of hardy microorganisms, such as pathogens. Three geographically distinct cleanrooms were sampled during the assembly of three NASA spacecraft: The Lockheed Martin Aeronautics' Multiple Testing Facility during DAWN, the Kennedy Space Center's Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF) during Phoenix, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Spacecraft Assembly Facility during Mars Science Laboratory. Sample sets were collected from the KSC-PHSF cleanroom at three time points: before arrival of the Phoenix spacecraft, during the assembly and testing of the Phoenix spacecraft, and after removal of the spacecraft from the KSC-PHSF facility. All samples were subjected to metagenomic shotgun sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Strict decontamination procedures had a greater impact on microbial communities than sampling location Samples collected during spacecraft assembly were dominated by Acinetobacter spp. We found pathogens and potential virulence factors, which determine pathogenicity in all the samples tested during this study. Though the relative abundance of pathogens was lowest during the Phoenix assembly, potential virulence factors were higher during assembly compared to before and after assembly, indicating a survival advantage. Decreased phylogenetic and pathogenic diversity indicates that decontamination and preventative measures were effective against the majority of microorganisms and well implemented, however, pathogen abundance still increased over time. Four potential pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Escherichia coli and Legionella pneumophila, and their corresponding virulence factors were present in all cleanroom samples. This is the first functional metagenomics study describing presence of pathogens and their corresponding virulence factors in cleanroom environments. The results of this study should be considered for microbial monitoring of enclosed environments such as schools, homes, hospitals and more isolated habitation such the International Space Station and future manned missions to Mars.},

  abstract = {Members of the Bacteroidetes, formerly known as the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) phylum, are among the major taxa of marine heterotrophic bacterioplankton frequently found on macroscopic organic matter particles (marine snow). In addition, they have been shown to also represent a significant part of free-living microbial assemblages in nutrient-rich microenvironments. Their abundance and distribution pattern in combination with enzymatic activity studies has led to the notion that organisms of this group are specialists for degradation of high molecular weight compounds in both the dissolved and particulate fraction of the marine organic matter pool, implying a major role of Bacteroidetes in the marine carbon cycle. Despite their ecological importance, comprehensive molecular data on organisms of this group have been scarce so far. Here we report on the first whole genome analysis of a marine Bacteroidetes representative, ‘Gramella forsetii’ KT0803. Functional analysis of the predicted proteome disclosed several traits which in joint consideration suggest a clear adaptation of this marine Bacteroidetes representative to the degradation of high molecular weight organic matter, such as a substantial suite of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes, a predicted preference for polymeric carbon sources and a distinct capability for surface adhesion.},

  abstract = {On-site wastewater treatment and dispersal systems (OWTS) are used in non-sewered populated areas in Australia to treat and dispose of household wastewater. The most common OWTS in Australia is the septic tank–soil absorption system (SAS)—which relies on the soil to treat and disperse effluent. The mechanisms governing purification and hydraulic performance of a SAS are complex and have been shown to be highly influenced by the biological zone (biomat) which develops on the soil surface within the trench or bed. Studies suggest that removal mechanisms in the biomat zone, primarily adsorption and filtering, are important processes in the overall purification abilities of a SAS. There is growing concern that poorly functioning OWTS are impacting upon the environment, although to date, only a few investigations have been able to demonstrate pollution of waterways by on-site systems. In this paper we review some key hydrological and biogeochemical mechanisms in SAS, and the processes leading to hydraulic failure. The nutrient and pathogen removal efficiencies in soil absorption systems are also reviewed, and a critical discussion of the evidence of failure and environmental and public health impacts arising from SAS operation is presented. Future research areas identified from the review include the interactions between hydraulic and treatment mechanisms, and the biomat and sub-biomat zone gas composition and its role in effluent treatment.},

  abstract = {Discovering why natural population densities change over time and vary with location is a central goal of ecological and evolutional disciplines. The recognition that even simple ecological systems can undergo chaotic behaviour has made chaos a topic of considerable interest among theoretical ecologists. However, there is still a lack of experimental evidence that chaotic behaviour occurs in the real world of coexisting populations in multi-species systems. Here we study the dynamics of a defined predator–prey system consisting of a bacterivorous ciliate and two bacterial prey species. The bacterial species preferred by the ciliate was the superior competitor. Experimental conditions were kept constant with continuous cultivation in a one-stage chemostat. We show that the dynamic behaviour of such a two-prey, one-predator system includes chaotic behaviour, as well as stable limit cycles and coexistence at equilibrium. Changes in the population dynamics were triggered by changes in the dilution rates of the chemostat. The observed dynamics were verified by estimating the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. Such a defined microbial food web offers a new possibility for the experimental study of deterministic chaos in real biological systems.},

Determinations of NPP are necessarily a function of phytoplankton biomass and its physiological status, but the estimation of these two terms from space has remained an elusive target. Here we present new satellite ocean color observations of phytoplankton carbon (C) and chlorophyll (Chl) biomass and show that derived Chl:C ratios closely follow anticipated physiological dependencies on light, nutrients, and temperature. With this new information, global estimates of phytoplankton growth rates (μ) and carbon-based NPP are made for the first time. Compared to an earlier chlorophyll-based approach, our carbon-based values are considerably higher in tropical oceans, show greater seasonality at middle and high latitudes, and illustrate important differences in the formation and demise of regional algal blooms. This fusion of emerging concepts from the phycological and remote sensing disciplines has the potential to fundamentally change how we model and observe carbon cycling in the global oceans.},

So far, bacteriorhodopsins capable of generating a chemiosmotic membrane potential in response to light have been demonstrated only in halophilic archaea. We describe here a type of rhodopsin derived from bacteria that was discovered through genomic analyses of naturally occuring marine bacterioplankton. The bacterial rhodopsin was encoded in the genome of an uncultivated γ-proteobacterium and shared highest amino acid sequence similarity with archaeal rhodopsins. The protein was functionally expressed inEscherichia coli and bound retinal to form an active, light-driven proton pump. The new rhodopsin exhibited a photochemical reaction cycle with intermediates and kinetics characteristic of archaeal proton-pumping rhodopsins. Our results demonstrate that archaeal-like rhodopsins are broadly distributed among different taxa, including members of the domain Bacteria. Our data also indicate that a previously unsuspected mode of bacterially mediated light-driven energy generation may commonly occur in oceanic surface waters worldwide.},

  abstract = {When a bacterial genome is compared to the metagenome of an environment it inhabits, most genes recruit at high sequence identity. In free-living bacteria (for instance marine bacteria compared against the ocean metagenome) certain genomic regions are totally absent in recruitment plots, representing therefore genes unique to individual bacterial isolates. We show that these Metagenomic Islands (MIs) are also visible in bacteria living in human hosts when their genomes are compared to sequences from the human microbiome, despite the compartmentalized structure of human-related environments such as the gut. From an applied point of view, MIs of human pathogens (e.g. those identified in enterohaemorragic Escherichia coli against the gut metagenome or in pathogenic Neisseria meningitidis against the oral metagenome) include virulence genes that appear to be absent in related strains or species present in the microbiome of healthy individuals. We propose that this strategy (i.e. recruitment analysis of pathogenic bacteria against the metagenome of healthy subjects) can be used to detect pathogenicity regions in species where the genes involved in virulence are poorly characterized. Using this approach, we detect well-known pathogenicity islands and identify new potential virulence genes in several human pathogens.},

They break down pollutants, municipal waste and ingested food, and they are the primary means by which organic matter is recycled to plants and other autotrophs. However, the processes that determine the rate at which these services are supplied are only starting to be identified. Biodiversity influences the way in which ecosystems function, but the form of the relationship between bacterial biodiversity and functioning remains poorly understood. Here we describe a manipulative experiment that measured how biodiversity affects the functioning of communities containing up to 72 bacterial species constructed from a collection of naturally occurring culturable bacteria. The experimental design allowed us to manipulate large numbers of bacterial species selected at random from those that were culturable. We demonstrate that there is a decelerating relationship between community respiration and increasing bacterial diversity. We also show that both synergistic interactions among bacterial species and the composition of the bacterial community are important in determining the level of ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient in the sea and its distribution is controlled by microorganisms. Within the N cycle, nitrite (NO2−) has a central role because its intermediate redox state allows both oxidation and reduction, and so it may be used by several coupled and/or competing microbial processes. In the upper water column and oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the eastern tropical North Pacific Ocean (ETNP), we investigated aerobic NO2− oxidation, and its relationship to ammonia (NH3) oxidation, using rate measurements, quantification of NO2−-oxidizing bacteria via quantitative PCR (QPCR), and pyrosequencing. 15NO2− oxidation rates typically exhibited two subsurface maxima at six stations sampled: one located below the euphotic zone and beneath NH3 oxidation rate maxima, and another within the OMZ. 15NO2− oxidation rates were highest where dissolved oxygen concentrations were {$<$}5 μM, where NO2− accumulated, and when nitrate (NO3−) reductase genes were expressed; they are likely sustained by NO3− reduction at these depths. QPCR and pyrosequencing data were strongly correlated (r2=0.79), and indicated that Nitrospina bacteria numbered up to 9.25\% of bacterial communities. Different Nitrospina groups were distributed across different depth ranges, suggesting significant ecological diversity within Nitrospina as a whole. Across the data set, 15NO2− oxidation rates were decoupled from 15NH4+ oxidation rates, but correlated with Nitrospina (r2=0.246, P{$<$}0.05) and NO2− concentrations (r2=0.276, P{$<$}0.05). Our findings suggest that Nitrospina have a quantitatively important role in NO2− oxidation and N cycling in the ETNP, and provide new insight into their ecology and interactions with other N-cycling processes in this biogeochemically important region of the ocean.},

  abstract = {Marine Crenarchaeota are among the most abundant microbial groups in the ocean, and although relatively little is currently known about their biogeochemical roles in marine ecosystems, recognition that Crenarchaeota posses ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes and may act as ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) offers another means of probing the ecology of these microorganisms. Here we use a time series approach combining quantification of archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidizers with bacterial community fingerprints and biogeochemistry, to explore the population and community ecology of nitrification. At multiple depths (150, 500 and 890~m) in the Southern California Bight sampled monthly from 2003 to 2006, AOA were enumerated via quantitative PCR of archaeal amoA and marine group 1 Crenarchaeota 16S rRNA genes. Based on amoA genes, AOA were highly variable in time – a consistent feature of marine Crenarchaeota– however, average values were similar at different depths and ranged from 2.20 to 2.76~×~104amoA copies ml−1. Archaeal amoA genes were correlated with Crenarchaeota 16S rRNA genes (r2~=~0.79) and the slope of this relationship was 1.02, demonstrating that the majority of marine group 1 Crenarchaeota present over the dates and depths sampled possessed amoA. Two AOA clades were specifically quantified and compared with betaproteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (β-AOB) amoA genes at 150~m; these AOA groups were found to strongly co-vary in time (r2~=~0.70, P~{$<~$}0.001) whereas AOA : β-AOB ratios ranged from 13 to 5630. Increases in the AOA : β-AOB ratio correlated with the accumulation of nitrite (r2~=~0.87, P~{$<~$}0.001), and may be indicative of differences in substrate affinities and activities leading to periodic decoupling between ammonia and nitrite oxidation. These data capture a dynamic nitrogen cycle in which multiple microbial groups appear to be active participants.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Tangential-flow ultrafiltration was used to isolate particulate and high-molecular-weight dissolved material from seawater collected at various depths and geographic regions of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Ultrafiltration proved to be a relatively fast and efficient method for the isolation of hundreds of milligrams of material. Optical and electron microscopy of the isolated materials revealed that relatively fragile materials were recovered intact. Depth-weighted results of the size distribution of organic matter in seawater indicated that \textasciitilde{} 75\% of marine organic carbon was low-molecular-weight (LMW) dissolved organic carbon (\&lt; 1 nm), \textasciitilde{} 24\% was high-molecular-weight (HMW) dissolved organic carbon (1–100 nm), and \textasciitilde{} 1\% was particulate organic carbon (\&gt; 100 nm). The distribution of carbon in surface water was shifted to greater relative abundances of larger size fractions, suggesting a diagenetic sequence from macromolecular material to small refractory molecules. The average C:N ratios of particulate organic matter (POM) and HMW dissolved organic matter (DOM) were 7.7 and 16.7, respectively. Differences in C:N ratios between POM and HMW DOM were large and invariant with depth and geographic region, indicating that the aggregation of HMW DOM to form POM must be of minor significance to overall carbon dynamics. The stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of POM averaged −22.7\%. in surface water and −25.2\%. in subsurface water. Several possible explanations for the observed isotopic shift with depth were explored, but we were unable to discern the cause. The δ13C of HMW DOM samples was relatively constant and averaged −21.7\%., indicating a predominantly marine origin for this material. The δ15N values of POM were highly variable (5.8–15.4\%.), and the availability of nitrate in surface waters appeared to be the major factor influencing δ15N values in the equatorial Pacific. In the upwelling region nitrate concentrations were relatively high and δ15N values of POM were low, whereas to the north and south of the upwelling nitrate concentrations were low and δ15N values were high. The δ15N values of HMW DOM reflected the same trends observed in the POM fraction and provided the first such evidence for biological cycling of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Using the observed δ15N values and an estimate of meridional advection velocity, we estimated a turnover time of 0.3 to 0.5\% day−1 for HMW DON. These results suggest a major role for DON in the upper ocean nitrogen cycle.},

METHODS This was a retrospective study of patients referred between August 2005 and May 2006 to our units in France and in the USA for a dating scan between 6 and 10 weeks. Included in our series were all embryos presenting with an ultrasound finding suggestive of an early pericardial fluid collection, i.e. a large anechoic fluid collection surrounding the heart. The gestational age, fetal heart rate and maternal age at this first scan were recorded, along with nuchal translucency thickness as measured at the 12-week scan and the second-trimester anomaly scan results. RESULTS Five cases were included in this study. In all five patients, the anechoic fluid collection was visualized at 8 weeks, and by the time of the nuchal scan it had disappeared completely. The nuchal translucency thickness was normal in all cases and all five embryos had normal cardiac examinations during the second trimester and were normal at birth. CONCLUSIONS The observation on ultrasound at 8 weeks' gestation of a large anechoic fluid collection surrounding the heart that disappears by week 12 is suggestive of a transient pericardial collection.},

Immediately after enclosure in microcosms, three different nutrient enrichments were performed: N-deficient, P-deficient and nutrient-balanced. N and P deficiencies affected the structure and the biochemical composition of the microbial communities. Phytoplankton assemblages showed similar temporal patterns under the three nutrient treatments, although the relative contribution of the different groups was notably affected. The lowest DNA concentration was measured in the P-deficient treatment, suggesting that P availability imposes the limits on the DNA levels in the ecosystem. The availability of N in the P-deficient microcosms allowed relatively high synthesis of chlorophyll and protein until the end of the experiment. Significantly high chlorophyll: DNA and protein: DNA ratios characterized the P-deficient treatment (where N was available) compared to the N-deficient microcosms. From the results obtained, we suggest that the protein: DNA ratios may constitute a biochemical indicator of the P versus N availability in natural ecosystems.},

During the flushing period, cooler, oxygen- and \$NO\_3\^-\$-rich\$ water replaces warmer, oxygen- and \$NO\_3\^- -depleted\$ bottom water. Flushing produces a decrease of \$0.2\^\textbackslash circ C\$ in the average temperature of San Pedro Basin bottom water (790-900 m) and an increase in the average oxygen content by \$12 \textbackslash mu M\$.

  abstract = {The concentrations of222Rn and226Ra in the water column and in the sediments of Santa Barbara and San Nicolas Basins have been measured semi-annually over the last four years. Approximately one-third of excess radon profiles obtained in the water column in these basins can be adequately fit with a one-dimensional eddy diffusion-decay model. Exponential profiles in the center of San Nicolas Basin yield a vertical eddy diffusivity of 26±16 cm2/s and 3.4±1.0 cm2/s for Santa Barbara Basin. The application of a two-dimensional eddy diffusion-decay model to profiles obtained in the center and on the margins of San Nicolas Basin produces a better fit than is found using a one-dimensional vertical eddy diffusivity. The two-dimensional model for San Nicolas Basin predicts a vertical eddy diffusivity of 17 cm2/s and a horizontal eddy diffusivity of 105 cm2/s. These values are in reasonable agreement with those predicted from the vertical buoyancy gradient and the horizontal length scale. The vertically integrated radon excess (standing crop) in the water column of Santa Barbara Basin averages 53±23 atoms/m2 s. This is in good agreement with the flux across the sediment-water interface of 60±15 atoms/m2 s, calculated by measuring radon emanation in the sediments as a function of depth and applying a molecular diffusion-reaction model. Hence, one-dimensional molecular diffusion accurately predicts the flux of radon from the laminated Santa Barbara Basin sediments. In San Nicolas Basin the integrated radon excess in the water column is 376±143 atoms/m2 s, but the diffusive randon flux from San Nicolas Basin sediments averages only 190±53 atoms/m2 s. This descrepancy indicates that a non-diffusive process, probably macrofaunal irrigation, supplies much of the flux of radon from San Nicolas Basin sediments.},

  abstract = {Background Considerable evidence in the learning sciences demonstrates the importance of engagement in online learning environments. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate feasibility and to develop and collect initial validity evidence for a computer-generated dynamic engagement score based on student interactions in an online learning environment, in this case virtual patients used for clinical education. Methods The study involved third-year medical students using virtual patient cases as a standard component of their educational program at more than 125 accredited US and Canadian medical schools. The engagement metric algorithm included four equally weighted components of student interactions with the virtual patient. We developed a self-report measure of motivational, emotional, and cognitive engagement and conducted confirmatory factor analysis to assess the validity of the survey responses. We gathered additional validity evidence through educator reviews, factor analysis of the metric, and correlations between student use of the engagement metric and self-report measures of learner engagement. Results Confirmatory factor analysis substantiated the hypothesized four-factor structure of the survey scales. Educator reviews demonstrated a high level of agreement with content and scoring cut-points (mean Pearson correlation 0.98; mean intra-class correlation 0.98). Confirmatory factor analysis yielded an acceptable fit to a one-factor model of the engagement score components. Correlations of the engagement score with self-report measures were statistically significant and in the predicted directions. Conclusions We present initial validity evidence for a dynamic online engagement metric based on student interactions in a virtual patient case. We discuss potential uses of such an engagement metric including better understanding of student interactions with online learning, improving engagement through instructional design and interpretation of learning analytics output.},

While photoautotrophic biofilms have long been used for wastewater remediation, biofuel production represents a relatively new and under-represented focus area. However, the direct measurement and characterization of fundamental parameters required for industrial control are challenging due to biofilm heterogeneity. This study evaluated oxygenic photosynthesis and respiration on two distinct microalgal biofilms cultured using a novel rotating algal biofilm reactor operated at field-and laboratory-scales. Clear differences in oxygenic photosynthesis and respiration were observed based on different culturing conditions, microalgal composition, light intensity and nitrogen availability. The cultures were also evaluated as potential biofuel synthesis strategies. Nitrogen depletion was not found to have the same effect on lipid accumulation compared to traditional planktonic microalgal studies. Physiological characterizations of these microalgal biofilms identify fundamental parameters needed to understand and control process optimization. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The effects of bioturbation in marine sediments are mainly associated with an increase in oxic and oxidized zones through an influx of oxygen-rich water deeper into the sediment and the rapid transport of particles between oxic and anoxic conditions. However, macrofaunal activity also can increase the occurrence of reduced microniches and anaerobic processes, such as sulfate reduction. Our goal was to determine the two-dimensional distribution of microniches associated with burrows of a ghost shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis) and to determine microbial activities. In laboratory experiments, detailed measurements of sulfate reduction rates (SRR) were measured by injecting, in a 1 cm grid, radiolabelled sulfate directly into a narrow aquarium (40 cm × 30 cm × 3 cm) containing the complex burrow of an actively burrowing shrimp. Light-coloured oxidized burrow walls, along with black reduced microniches, were clearly visible through the aquarium walls. Direct injection of radiotracers allowed for whole-aquarium incubation to obtain two-dimensional documentation of sulfate reduction. Results indicated SRR were up to three orders of magnitude higher (140–790 nmol SO42− cm−3 day−1) in reduced microniches associated with burrows when compared with the surrounding sediment. Additionally, some of the subsurface sulfate-reducing microniches associated with the burrow system appeared to be zones of dinitrogen fixation. Bioturbation may also lead to decreased sulfate reduction in other microniches and the sum of the activity in all microniches might not result in a total increase of sulfate reduction compared with non-bioturbated control sediments.},

  abstract = {Background Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are expanding in the World Ocean as a result of climate change and direct anthropogenic influence. OMZ expansion greatly affects biogeochemical processes and marine life, especially by constraining the vertical habitat of most marine organisms. Currently, monitoring the variability of the upper limit of the OMZs relies on time intensive sampling protocols, causing poor spatial resolution. Methodology/Principal Findings Using routine underwater acoustic observations of the vertical distribution of marine organisms, we propose a new method that allows determination of the upper limit of the OMZ with a high precision. Applied in the eastern South-Pacific, this original sampling technique provides high-resolution information on the depth of the upper OMZ allowing documentation of mesoscale and submesoscale features (e.g., eddies and filaments) that structure the upper ocean and the marine ecosystems. We also use this information to estimate the habitable volume for the world's most exploited fish, the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens). Conclusions/Significance This opportunistic method could be implemented on any vessel geared with multi-frequency echosounders to perform comprehensive high-resolution monitoring of the upper limit of the OMZ. Our approach is a novel way of studying the impact of physical processes on marine life and extracting valid information about the pelagic habitat and its spatial structure, a crucial aspect of Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management in the current context of climate change.},

  abstract = {The ammonia monooxygenase of chemolithotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) catalyzes the first step in ammonia oxidation by converting ammonia to hydroxylamine. The monooxygenase of Nitrosomonas europaea is encoded by two nearly identical operon copies (amoCAB(1,2)). Several AOB, including N. europaea, also possess a divergent monocistronic copy of amoC (amoC(3)) of unknown function. Previous work suggested a possible functional role for amoC(3) as part of the sigma(E) stress response regulon during the recovery of N. europaea from extended ammonia starvation, thus indicating its importance during the exit of cells from starvation. We here used global transcription analysis to show that expression of amoC(3) is part of a general poststarvation cellular response system in N. europaea. We also found that amoC(3) is required for an efficient response to some stress conditions, as deleting this gene impaired growth at elevated temperatures and recovery following starvation under high oxygen tensions. Deletion of the sigma(32) global stress response regulator demonstrated that the heat shock regulon plays a significant role in mediating the recovery of N. europaea from starvation. These findings provide the first described phenotype associated with the divergent AmoC(3) subunit which appears to function as a stress-responsive subunit capable of maintaining ammonia oxidation activity under stress conditions. While this study was limited to starvation and heat shock, it is possible that the AmoC(3) subunit may be responsive to other membrane stressors (e.g., solvent or osmotic shocks) that are prevalent in the environments of AOB.},

The consumption of raw oysters has been repeatedly linked to outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis and hepatitis A. Switzerland imports over 300 tons of oysters per year, 95\% of which originate in France. To assess the level of viral contamination, a 3-month monitoring study was conducted. Therefore, the sensitivities of several previously described methods for virus concentration were compared, and one protocol was finally chosen by using dissected digestive tissues. Eighty-seven samples consisting of five oysters each were analyzed for Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs), enteroviruses, and hepatitis A viruses from November 2001 to February 2002. The oysters were exported by 31 French, three Dutch, and two Irish suppliers. Eight oyster samples from six French suppliers were positive for NLVs, and four samples from four French suppliers were positive for enteroviruses; two of the latter samples were positive for both viral agents. No hepatitis A viruses were detected. The sequences of NLV and enterovirus amplicons showed a great variety of strains, especially for the NLVs (strains similar to Bristol, Hawaii, Mexico, and Melksham agent). The data obtained indicated that imported oysters might be a source of NLV infection in Switzerland. However, further studies are needed to determine the quantitative significance of the risk factor within the overall epidemiology of NLVs.},

Although major routes of its transmission involve respiratory droplets and direct contact, the infection through faecal matter is also possible. Conventional sewage treatment methods with disinfection are expected to eradicate SARS-CoV-2. However, for densely populated countries like India with lower sewage treatment facilities, chances of contamination are extremely high; as SARS-CoVs can survive up to several days in untreated sewage; even for a much longer period in low-temperature regions. With around 1.8 billion people worldwide using faecal-contaminated source as drinking water, the risk of transmission of COVID-19 is expected to increase by several folds, if proper precautions are not being taken.

We develop a parameterization of DVM in the ocean and integrate it with a size-structured NPZD model. We assess the model's ability to recreate ecosystem and DVM patterns at three well-observed Pacific sites, ALOHA, K2, and EQPAC, and use it to estimate the impact of DVM on marine ecosystems and biogeochemical dynamics. Our model includes the following: (1) a representation of migration dynamics in response to food availability and light intensity; (2) a representation of the digestive and metabolic processes that decouple zooplankton feeding from excretion, egestion, and respiration; and (3) a light-dependent parameterization of visual predation on zooplankton. The model captures the first-order patterns in plankton biomass and productivity across the biomes, including the biomass of migrating organisms. We estimate that realistic migratory populations sustain active fluxes to the mesopelagic zone equivalent to between 15\% and 40\% of the particle export and contribute up to half of the total respiration within the layers affected by migration. The localized active transport has important consequences for the cycling of oxygen, nutrients, and carbon. We highlight the importance of decoupling zooplankton feeding and respiration and excretion with depth for capturing the impact of migration on the redistribution of carbon and nutrients in the upper ocean.},

  abstract = {Measurements show that anaerobic ammonium oxidation with nitrite (anammox) is a major pathway of fixed nitrogen removal in the anoxic zones of the open ocean. Anammox requires a source of ammonium, which under anoxic conditions could be supplied by the breakdown of sinking organic matter via heterotrophic denitrification. However, at many locations where anammox is measured, denitrification rates are small or undetectable. Alternative sources of ammonium have been proposed to explain this paradox, for example through dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium and transport from anoxic sediments. However, the relevance of these sources in open-ocean anoxic zones is debated. Here, we bring to attention an additional source of ammonium, namely, the daytime excretion by zooplankton and micronekton migrating from the surface to anoxic waters. We use a synthesis of acoustic data to show that, where anoxic waters occur within the water column, most migrators spend the daytime within them. Although migrators export only a small fraction of primary production from the surface, they focus excretion within a confined depth range of anoxic water where particle input is small. Using a simple biogeochemical model, we suggest that, at those depths, the source of ammonium from organisms undergoing diel vertical migrations could exceed the release from particle remineralization, enhancing in situ anammox rates. The contribution of this previously overlooked process, and the numerous uncertainties surrounding it, call for further efforts to evaluate the role of animals in oxygen minimum zone biogeochemistry.},

  abstract = {Throughout the ocean, countless small animals swim to depth in the daytime, presumably to seek refuge from large predators. These animals return to the surface at night to feed. This substantial diel vertical migration can result in the transfer of significant amounts of carbon and nutrients from the surface to depth. However, its consequences on ocean chemistry at the global scale have remained uncertain. Here, we determine the depths of these diel migrations in the global ocean using a global array of backscatter data from acoustic Doppler current profilers, collected between 1990 and 2011. We show that the depth of diel migration follows coherent large-scale patterns. We find that migration depth is greater where subsurface oxygen concentrations are high, such that seawater oxygen concentration is the best single predictor of migration depth at the global scale. In oxygen minimum zone areas, migratory animals generally descend as far as the upper margins of the low-oxygen waters. Using an ocean biogeochemical model coupled to a general circulation model, we show that by focusing oxygen consumption in poorly ventilated regions of the upper ocean, diel vertical migration intensifies oxygen depletion in the upper margin of oxygen minimum zones. We suggest that future changes in the extent of oxygen minimum zones could alter the migratory depths of marine organisms, with consequences for marine biogeochemistry, food webs and fisheries.},

  abstract = {Human exposure to pathogenic viruses in environmental waters results in a significant global disease burden. Current microbial water quality monitoring approaches, mainly based on fecal indicator bacteria, insufficiently capture human health impacts posed by pathogenic viruses in water. The emergence of the ‘microbiome era’ and high-throughput metagenome sequencing has led to the discovery of novel human-associated viruses, including both pathogenic and commensal viruses in the human microbiome. The discovery of novel human-associated viruses is often followed by their detection in wastewater, highlighting the great diversity of human-associated viruses potentially present in the water environment. Novel human-associated viruses provide a rich reservoir to develop viral water quality management tools with diverse applications, such as regulating wastewater reuse and monitoring agricultural and recreational waters. Here, we review the pathway from viral discovery to water quality monitoring tool, and highlight select human-associated viruses identified by metagenomics and subsequently detected in the water environment (namely Bocavirus, Cosavirus, CrAssphage, Klassevirus, and Pepper Mild Mottle Virus). We also discuss research needs to enable the application of recently discovered human-associated viruses in water quality monitoring, including investigating the geographic distribution, environmental fate, and viability of potential indicator viruses. Examples suggest that recently discovered human pathogens are likely to be less abundant in sewage, while other human-associated viruses (e.g., bacteriophages or viruses from food) are more abundant but less human-specific. The improved resolution of human-associated viral diversity enabled by metagenomic tools provides a significant opportunity for improved viral water quality management tools.},

To achieve this goal, we determined pigment marker distributions in conjunction with collaborative measurements performed by EqPac investigators. Distributions of phytoplankton pigments measured during early 1992 (El Niño conditions) were different from those measured during late 1992 ("normal" conditions). Most notably, the accessory pigment distributions revealed that the 1991-1992 El Niño event produced a significant reduction in eukaryotic phytoplankton biomass, especially that contributed by prymnesiophytes, pelagophytes and diatoms. This variability was most likely caused by a combination of physical (Kelvin waves, tropical instability waves and advection), chemical (iron limitation) and biological (growth-grazing imbalances) processes. The results of this pigment study underscore the need for sampling biological properties on the appropriate time and space scales, and the necessity of physical measurements for interpreting their distributions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Downward fluxes of biogenic silica and organic matter in the global ocean derive dominantly from the productivity of diatoms — phytoplankton with cell walls containing silica encased in an organic matrix,. As diatoms have an absolute requirement for silicon (as silicic acid), its supply into the photic zone — largely by silica dissolution and upwelling — controls diatom production (and consequently the biological uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the ocean) over vast oceanic areas. Current biogeochemical models assume silica dissolution to be controlled by temperature, zooplankton grazing and diatom aggregation,, but the role of bacteria has not been established. Yet bacteria utilize about half of the organic matter derived from oceanic primary production by varied strategies, including attack on dead and living diatoms by using hydrolytic enzymes,, and could adventitiously hasten silica dissolution by degrading the organic matrix which protects diatom frustules from dissolution,. Here we report the results of experiments in which natural assemblages of marine bacteria dramatically increased silica dissolution from two species of lysed marine diatoms compared to bacteria-free controls. Silica dissolution accompanied, and was caused by, bacterial colonization and hydrolytic attack. Bacteria-mediated silicon regeneration rates varied with diatom type and bacterial assemblage; observed rates could explain most of the reported upper-ocean silicon regeneration,. Bacteria-mediated silicon regeneration may thus critically control diatom productivity and the cycling and fate of silicon and carbon in the ocean.},

  abstract = {A biological neuron model, also known as a spiking neuron model, is a mathematical description of the properties of certain cells in the nervous system that generate sharp electrical potentials across their cell membrane, roughly one millisecond in duration, as shown in Fig. 1.   Spiking neurons are known to be a major signaling unit of the nervous system, and for this reason characterizing their operation is of great importance. It is worth noting that not all the cells of the nervous system produce the type of spike that define the scope of the spiking neuron models. For example, cochlear hair cells, retinal receptor cells, and retinal bipolar cells do not spike. Furthermore, many cells in the nervous system are not classified as neurons but instead are classified as glia. Ultimately, biological neuron models aim to explain the mechanisms underlying the operation of the nervous system for the purpose of restoring lost control capabilities such as perception (e.g. deafness or blindness), decision making, and continuous limb control. In that sense, biological neuron models differ from artificial neuron models that do not presume to predict the outcomes of experiments involving the biological neural tissue (although artificial neuron models are also concerned with execution of  perception and estimation tasks). Accordingly, an important aspect of biological neuron models is experimental validation, and the use of physical units to describe the experimental procedure associated with the model predictions. Neuron models can be divided into two categories according to the physical units of the interface of the model. Each category could be further divided according to the abstraction/detail level:  Electrical input–output membrane voltage models – These models produce a prediction for membrane output voltage as function of electrical stimulation at the input stage (either voltage or current). The various models in this category differ in the exact functional relationship between the input current and the output voltage and in the level of details. Some models in this category are black box models and distinguish only between two measured voltage levels: the presence of a spike (also known as "action potential") or a quiescent state. Other models are more detailed and account for sub-cellular processes. Natural or pharmacological input neuron models – The models in this category connect between the input stimulus which can be either pharmacological or natural, to the probability of a spike event. The input stage of  these models is not electrical, but rather has either pharmacological (chemical) concentration units, or physical units that characterize an external stimulus such as light, sound or other forms of physical pressure. Furthermore, the output stage represents the probability of a spike event and not an electrical voltage. Typically, this output probability is normalized (divided by) a time constant, and the resulting normalized probability is called the "firing rate" and has units of Hertz.  The probabilistic description taken by the models in this category was inspired from laboratory experiments involving either natural or pharmacological stimulation which exhibit variability in the resulting spike pattern. Nevertheless, when averaging these experimental results across several trials,  a clear pattern is often revealed. Although it is not unusual in science and engineering to have several descriptive models for different abstraction/detail levels, the number of different, sometimes contradicting, biological neuron models is exceptionally high. This situation is partly the result of the many different experimental settings, and the difficulty to separate the intrinsic properties of a single neuron from measurements effects and interactions of many cells (network effects). To accelerate the convergence to a unified theory, we list several models in each category, and where applicable, also references to supporting experiments.},

In the upper 450 m of the water column, population dynamics of a size-fractionated phytoplankton community were forced by daily changes of wind, light, grazing stress, and nutrient availability. The temporal variations of production and chlorophyll were driven by changes in nutrient introduction to the euphotic zone due to both high- and low-frequency changes of the mixed layer depth within 32-degrees-34-degrees-N, 62-degrees-64-degrees-W between 1979 and 1984. Results from the model derived from high-frequency (case 1) changes in the mixed layer depth showed variations in primary production and peak chlorophyll concentrations when compared with results from the model derived from low-frequency (case 2) mixed layer depth changes. Incorporation of size-fractionated plankton state variables in the model led to greater seasonal resolution of measured primary production and vertical chlorophyll profiles. The findings of this study highlight the possible inadequacy of estimating primary production in the sea from data of low-frequency temporal resolution and oversimplified biological simulations.},

This study assessed the relationship between the transcriptional profile of benthic amphipods of genus Diporeia and the presence of the CRESS-DNA virus, LM29173, in the Laurentian Great Lakes to provide potential insight into the influence of these viruses on invertebrate gene expression. Twelve transcriptomes derived from Diporeia were compared, representing organisms from two amphipod haplotype clades (Great Lakes Michigan and Superior, defined by COI barcode sequencing) with varying viral loads (up to 3 × 106 genome copies organism−1). Read recruitment to de novo assembled transcripts revealed 2,208 significantly over or underexpressed contigs in transcriptomes with above average LM29173 load. Of these contigs, 31.5\% were assigned a putative function. The greatest proportion of annotated, differentially expressed transcripts were associated with functions including: (1) replication, recombination, and repair, (2) cell structure/biogenesis, and (3) post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones. Contigs putatively associated with innate immunity displayed no consistent pattern of expression, though several transcripts were significantly overexpressed in amphipods with high viral load. Quantitation (RT-qPCR) of target transcripts, non-muscular myosin heavy chain, β-actin, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, corroborated transcriptome analysis and indicated that Lake Michigan and Lake Superior amphipods with high LM29173 load exhibit lake-specific trends in gene expression. While this investigation provides the first comparative survey of the transcriptional profile of invertebrates of variable CRESS-DNA viral load, additional inquiry is required to define the scope of host-specific responses to potential infection.},

  abstract = {Organic particles (hereafter particles) determine aquatic carbon pump efficiency, largely depending on microbial dynamics and activities. Current understanding is that particles sources dictate initial microbial colonization which is followed by rapid succession events as organic matter quality and nutrient content change due to microbial degradation. We applied a transcriptomic approach to assess the role of stochastic events on initial microbial colonization of particles. Furthermore, we asked whether gene expression corroborates rapid changes in carbon-quality. Commonly used fractionated filtration averages thousands of particles of different sizes, sources and ages. To overcome this drawback, we used replicate samples consisting of 3-4 pooled particles of identical source and age and further evaluated the consequences of averaging multiple particles. Using flow-through rolling tanks we conducted long-term experiments at near-in-situ conditions minimizing the traditional bottle-effect. Active microbial communities were highly heterogeneous despite an identical particle source, suggesting random initial colonization. Contrasting previous reports, expression of carbon utilization genes didn’t change after one week of incubation. Consequently, we suggest that in nature, changes in particle-associated community related to carbon availability are likely slow (days to weeks) due to constant supply of labile organic matter. Initial, random particle colonization seems to be subsequently altered by multiple organismic interactions shaping microbial community interactions and functional dynamics. Comparative analysis of pooled samples suggests that mechanistic studies of microbial dynamics should be done on single particles. The observed microbial heterogeneity and inter-organismic interactions may have important implications for evolution and biogeochemistry in aquatic systems.},

In this review, we propose a unified framework for biological invasions that reconciles and integrates the key features of the most commonly used invasion frameworks into a single conceptual model that can be applied to all human-mediated invasions. The unified framework combines previous stage-based and barrier models, and provides a terminology and categorisation for populations at different points in the invasion process.},

  abstract = {A mechanistic model of a simplified microbial food web was implemented based on spatially explicit transport of nutrients and energy sources by molecular diffusion. Individual organisms were simulated to interact in a two- dimensional arena consisting of 70 X 70 interconnected hexagonal compartments each of 2 nl in volume. Release of dissolved organic matter in conjunction with predation events resulted in patches of increased concentration lasting long enough to be consumed completely by bacteria before being dispersed. Individual bacteria encountered concentrations of dissolved organic matter varying up to loo-fold within time scales significant for growth. The simulations also predicted that given a chemotactic response to nutrient gradients, bacteria could grow 50\% faster on average when gathered in loose clusters within patches. Extending the scenario to the three-dimensional case and looking at a l-ml volume, patch-generating events were estimated to occur several times per hour and spread to within a few millimeters in radius before being eroded by bacteria. The erosion time scale is probably longer than the time between patch appearances resulting in patches overlapping and creating a markedly inhomogeneous microenvironment. In such a scenario, foraging strategies enabling bacteria and predators to respond to elevated concentrations of food could represent a significant adaptive advantage.}

  abstract = {An extremely affordable virus concentration method based on adsorption-elution to glass wool and subsequent reconcentration through polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) precipitation was optimized to recover not only non-enveloped viruses but also enveloped viruses. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were employed as surrogates for naked and enveloped viruses, respectively, to set up the methodology. Initial experimentation in small-volume samples showed that both types of particles readily adsorbed to the positively charged glass wool but were poorly detached from it through standard elution with 0.05~M glycine with 3\% of beef extract buffer, pH 9.5, with elution efficiencies of 7.2\% and 2.6\%, for HAV and TGEV, respectively. To improve the recovery of enveloped viruses, several modifications in the elution were assayed: increasing the elution pH, extending glass wool and eluent contact time, adding a detergent, or performing the elution by recirculation or under agitation. Considering practicability and performance, recircularization of the eluent at pH 11.0 for 20~min was the elution procedure of choice, with efficiencies of 25.7\% and 18.8\% for HAV and TGEV in 50~L of water. Additionally, employing 20\% PEG instead of 10\% for virus reconcentration improved recoveries up to 47\% and 51\%, respectively. The optimized procedure was applied to detect naturally occurring HAV and coronaviruses in surface water of Wadi Hanifa, Riyadh. HAV was detected in 38\% of the samples, while one sample was positive for an alphacoronavirus. This cheap virus detection system enables the comprehensive surveillance of viruses present in water samples.},

Particularly, we searched for species-specific bacteria, which could be considered as symbionts. To reduce temporal and spatial environmentally caused differences between host species, we sampled all the sponge species present in an isolated small rocky area in a single dive. The bacterial communities identified by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA gene showed that all HMA species clustered separated from LMA sponges and seawater. HMA sponges often had highest diversity, but some LMA sponges had also very diverse bacterial communities. Network analyses indicated that no core bacterial community seemed to exist for the studied sponges, not even for such a space and time-restricted sampling. Most sequences, particularly the most abundant ones in each species, were species-specific for both HMA and LMA sponges. The bacterial sequences retrieved from LMA sponges, despite being phylogenetically more similar to seawater, did not represent transient seawater bacteria. We conclude that sponge bacterial communities depend more on the host affiliation to the HMA or LMA groups than on host phylogeny.},

Here, we collected bathypelagic marine snow by gentle gravity filtration of sea water onto 30\,μm filters from \textasciitilde 1000 to 3900\,m to investigate the relative distribution of eukaryotic microbes. Compared with sediment traps that select for fast-sinking particles, this method collects particles unbiased by settling velocity. While prokaryotes numerically exceeded eukaryotes on marine snow, eukaryotic microbes belonging to two very distant branches of the eukaryote tree, the fungi and the labyrinthulomycetes, dominated overall biomass. Being tolerant to cold temperature and high hydrostatic pressure, these saprotrophic organisms have the potential to significantly contribute to the degradation of organic matter in the deep sea. Our results demonstrate that the community composition on bathypelagic marine snow differs greatly from that in the ambient water leading to wide ecological niche separation between the two environments.},

In bathy- and abyssopelagic layers of the ocean (2,000–6,000 m), however, microscopic particles may not dominate oxygen consumption. In a section across the tropical Atlantic, we show that macroscopic particle peaks occurred frequently in the deep sea, whereas microscopic particles were barely detectable. In 10 of 17 deep-sea profiles ({$>$}2,000 m depth), macroscopic particle abundances were more strongly cross-correlated with oxygen deficits than microscopic particles, suggesting that biomass bound to large particles dominates overall deep-sea metabolism.},

Isotherms typically associated with the waste field near the outfall are observed just outside the Huntington Beach surf zone, where the total depth is less than 6 m, highlighting the extent of the cross-shelf transport. This advection is attributed to a mode 1 internal motion, or internal tide. On the basis of the analyses presented here, the OCSD plume cannot be ruled out as a contributor to poor bathing-water quality at Huntington Beach.},

Flagellates and other protists are assumed to be the most important predators of these ultramicrobacteria as well as of larger planktonic bacteria. However, due to controversial observations conducted previously, it is not clear as to whether fractions of the ultramicrobacteria are resistant to flagellate predation. Furthermore, it is not known if closely related bacteria vary significantly in their sensitivity to flagellate predation. We investigated the sensitivity of ultramicrobacteria affiliated with the cosmopolitan Polynucleobacter cluster to grazing by Spumella-like nanoflagellates. Laboratory grazing experiments with four closely related (≥99.6\% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) bacteria and three closely related (100\% 18S rRNA gene sequence similarity) flagellates were performed. In comparison to larger bacteria, predation on the ultramicrobacterial Polynucleobacter strains was weak, and the growth of the predating flagellates was slow. Specific clearance rates ranged between 0.14 × 105 and 2.8 × 105 units of predator size h−1. Feeding rates strongly depended on the flagellate and bacterial strain (P {$<$} 0.001). Grazing mortality rates of the three flagellate strains investigated varied for the same prey strain by up to almost fourfold. We conclude that (i) ultramicrobacteria affiliated with the Polynucleobacter cluster are not protected from grazing, (ii) strain-specific variations in grazing sensitivity even between closely related bacteria are high, and (iii) strain-specific differences in predator-prey interaction could be an important factor in the evolution and maintenance of microbial microdiversity.},

  abstract = {Sinking particles are a critical conduit for the export of organic material from surface waters to the deep ocean. Despite their importance in oceanic carbon cycling and export, little is known about the biotic composition, origins, and variability of sinking particles reaching abyssal depths. Here, we analyzed particle-associated nucleic acids captured and preserved in sediment traps at 4,000-m depth in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Over the 9-month time-series, Bacteria dominated both the rRNA-gene and rRNA pools, followed by eukaryotes (protists and animals) and trace amounts of Archaea. Deep-sea piezophile-like Gammaproteobacteria, along with Epsilonproteobacteria, comprised {$>$}80\% of the bacterial inventory. Protists (mostly Rhizaria, Syndinales, and ciliates) and metazoa (predominantly pelagic mollusks and cnidarians) were the most common sinking particle-associated eukaryotes. Some near-surface water-derived eukaryotes, especially Foraminifera, Radiolaria, and pteropods, varied greatly in their abundance patterns, presumably due to sporadic export events. The dominance of piezophile-like Gammaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria, along with the prevalence of their nitrogen cycling-associated gene transcripts, suggested a central role for these bacteria in the mineralization and biogeochemical transformation of sinking particulate organic matter in the deep ocean. Our data also reflected several different modes of particle export dynamics, including summer export, more stochastic inputs from the upper water column by protists and pteropods, and contributions from sinking mid- and deep-water organisms. In total, our observations revealed the variable and heterogeneous biological origins and microbial activities of sinking particles that connect their downward transport, transformation, and degradation to deep-sea biogeochemical processes.},

  abstract = {It has been hypothesised that several microbial processes contribute to mucilage formation and transformation. However, to date, none of these mechanisms have been consistently tested using different types of mucilage. We investigated the biochemical composition and the microbial activities occurring in 9 different types of mucilage aggregates (macroflocs, stringers, cobwebs, ribbons, stringers/cobwebs clouds, big creamy surface layer, false bottoms and anoxic false bottoms) collected during summer 2000, 2002 and 2003 in the Adriatic Sea. Larger and aged aggregates, characterized by the accumulation of carbohydrate and a low lipid fraction, displayed significant biochemical differences when compared with younger aggregates. Prokaryote abundance, C production and extracellular enzymatic activities increased from small to medium-sized aggregates (corresponding approximately to mid life span) while they decreased in larger (and aged) aggregates. The highest prokaryotic C production and enzymatic activities were coupled with highest viral abundance. In mucilage displaying the highest viral abundance a reduced incorporation of enzymatically degraded C into prokaryote biomass was observed. This result suggests a potential involvement of viruses in the impairment of the microbial loop functioning in marine aggregates. Applying a multivariate analysis to the microbial variables, 3 stages of mucilage life span can be identified: (1) an early stage characterized by a large prokaryote colonization of the aggregate and DOM accumulation; (2) a mature stage characterized by a decreased capability of incorporating degraded C into prokaryote biomass and high viral abundance and (3) an aged stage characterized by the decrease in both viral and prokaryote abundance and prokaryote activity. These results provide new insights into the microbial ecology of marine aggregates and the processes influencing their life span.},

For instance, the gender ratio in biology is more balanced than in computer science. We were interested in how this difference is reflected in the interdisciplinary field of computational/quantitative biology. To this end, we examined the proportion of female authors in publications from the PubMed and arXiv databases. There are fewer female authors on research papers in computational biology, as compared to biology in general. This is true across authorship position, year, and journal impact factor. A comparison with arXiv shows that quantitative biology papers have a higher ratio of female authors than computer science papers, placing computational biology in between its two parent fields in terms of gender representation.

  abstract = {Microbial mats are self-sustained, functionally complex ecosystems that make good models for the understanding of past and present microbial ecosystems as well as putative extraterrestrial ecosystems. Ecological theory suggests that the composition of these communities might be affected by nutrient availability and disturbance frequency. We characterized two microbial mats from two contrasting environments in the oligotrophic Cuatro Ciénegas Basin: a permanent green pool and a red desiccation pond. We analyzed their taxonomic structure and composition by means of 16S rRNA clone libraries and metagenomics and inferred their metabolic role by the analysis of functional traits in the most abundant organisms. Both mats showed a high diversity with metabolically diverse members and strongly differed in structure and composition. The green mat had a higher species richness and evenness than the red mat, which was dominated by a lineage of Pseudomonas. Autotrophs were abundant in the green mat, and heterotrophs were abundant in the red mat. When comparing with other mats and stromatolites, we found that taxonomic composition was not shared at species level but at order level, which suggests environmental filtering for phylogenetically conserved functional traits with random selection of particular organisms. The highest diversity and composition similarity was observed among systems from stable environments, which suggests that disturbance regimes might affect diversity more strongly than nutrient availability, since oligotrophy does not appear to prevent the establishment of complex and diverse microbial mat communities. These results are discussed in light of the search for extraterrestrial life. Key Words: Cuatro Ciénegas—Metagenomics—Microbial mats—Oligotrophic—Phosphorus limitation—Stromatolites.

DOI: 10.1111/j.1752-1688.2012.00689.x Abstract: We analyzed an ensemble of watershed models that predict flow, nitrogen, and phosphorus discharges. The models differed in scope and complexity and used different input data, but all had been applied to evaluate human impacts on discharges to the Patuxent River or to the Chesapeake Bay. We compared predictions to observations of average annual, annual time series, and monthly discharge leaving three basins. No model consistently matched observed discharges better than the others, and predictions differed as much as 150\% for every basin. Models that agreed best with the observations in one basin often were among the worst models for another material or basin. Combining model predictions into a model average improved overall reliability in matching observations, and the range of predictions helped describe uncertainty. The model average was not the closest to the observed discharge for every material, basin, and time frame, but the model average had the highest Nash–Sutcliffe performance across all combinations. Consistently poor performance in predicting phosphorus loads suggests that none of the models capture major controls. Differences among model predictions came from differences in model structures, input data, and the time period considered, and also to errors in the observed discharge. Ensemble watershed modeling helped identify research needs and quantify the uncertainties that should be considered when using the models in management decisions.},

  abstract = {Future climate change will affect marine productivity, as well as other many components of Earth system. We have investigated the response of marine productivity to global warming with two different ocean biogeochemical schemes and two different atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation models (GCM). Both coupled GCMs were used without flux correction to simulate climate response to increased greenhouse gases (+1\% CO2/yr for 80 years). At 2×CO2, increased stratification leads to both reduced nutrient supply and increased light efficiency. Both effects drive a reduction in marine export production (−6\%), although regionally changes can be both negative and positive (from −15\% zonal average in the tropics to +10\% in the Southern Ocean). Both coupled models and both biogeochemical schemes simulate a poleward shift of marine production due mainly to a longer growing season at high latitudes. At low latitudes, the effect of reduced upwelling prevails. The resulting reduction in marine productivity, and other marine resources, could become detectable in the near future, if appropriate long-term observing systems are implemented.},

  abstract = {The frequency of cyanobacterial proliferations in fresh waters is increasing worldwide and the presence of associated cyanotoxins represent a threat for ecosystems and human health. While the occurrence of microcystin (MC), the most widespread cyanotoxin, is well documented in freshwaters, only few studies have examined its occurrence in estuarine waters. In this study we evaluated the transfer of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins along a river continuum from a freshwater reservoir through an interconnecting estuary to the coastal area in Brittany, France. We sampled regularly over 2 years at 5 stations along the river continuum and analysed for phytoplankton and cyanotoxins, together with physico-chemical parameters. Results show that cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplanktonic community with high densities (up to 2\,×\,106 cells mL−1) at the freshwater sites during the summer and autumn periods of both years, with a cell transfer to estuarine (up to 105 cells mL−1) and marine (2\,×\,103 cells mL−1) sites. While the temporal variation in cyanobacterial densities was mainly associated with temperature, spatial variation was due to salinity while nutrients were non-limiting for cyanobacterial growth. Cyanobacterial biomass was dominated by several species of Microcystis that survived intermediate salinities. Intracellular MCs were detected in all the freshwater samples with concentrations up to 60\,μg L−1, and more intermittently with concentrations up to 1.15\,μg L−1, at the most upstream estuarine site. Intracellular MC was only sporadically detected and in low concentration at the most downstream estuarine site and at the marine outlet (respectively {$<$}0.14\,μg L-1 and {$<$}0.03\,μg L−1). Different MC variants were detected with dominance of MC-LR, RR and YR and that dominance was conserved along the salinity gradient. Extracellular MC contribution to total MC was higher at the downstream sites in accordance with the lysing of the cells at elevated salinities. No nodularin (NOD) was detected in the particulate samples or in the filtrates.},

  abstract = {Some unicellular N(2)-fixing cyanobacteria have recently been found to lack a functional photosystem II of photosynthesis. Such organisms, provisionally termed UCYN-A, of the oceanic picoplanktion are major contributors to the global marine N-input by N(2)-fixation. Since their photosystem II is inactive, they can perform N(2)-fixation during the day. UCYN-A organisms cannot be cultivated as yet. Their genomic analysis indicates that they lack genes coding for enzymes of the Calvin cycle, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and for the biosynthesis of several amino acids. The carbon source in the ocean that allows them to thrive in such high abundance has not been identified. Their genomic analysis implies that they metabolize organic carbon by a new mode of life. These unicellular N(2)-fixing cyanobacteria of the oceanic picoplankton are evolutionarily related to spheroid bodies present in diatoms of the family Epithemiaceae, such as Rhopalodia gibba. More recently, spheroid bodies were ultimately proven to be related to cyanobacteria and to express nitrogenase. They have been reported to be completely inactive in all photosynthetic reactions despite the presence of thylakoids. Sequence data show that R. gibba and its spheroid bodies are an evolutionarily young symbiosis that might serve as a model system to unravel early events in the evolution of chloroplasts. The cell metabolism of UCYN-A and the spheroid bodies may be related to that of the acetate photoassimilating green alga Chlamydobotrys.},

The organic speciation of dissolved cobalt was determined by competing ligand exchange adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (CLE-AdCSV) using nioxime as a competing ligand. The concentrations of the organic ligands (L) ranged between 26 and 73 pM, and the conditional stability constants (log K'(CoL)) of the organic complexes of Co between 17.9 and 20.1. Most dissolved cobalt was organically complexed in the water-column (60 to {$>$} 99.9\%). There were clear vertical and meridional patterns in the distribution of L and the organic speciation of DCo along the section. These patterns suggest a biological source of the organic ligands in the surface waters of the subtropical domain and northern subantarctic region, potentially driven by the cyanobacteria, and a removal of the organic Co by direct or indirect biological uptake. The highest L:DCo ratio (5.81 +/- 1.07 pM pM(-1)) observed in these surface waters reflected the combined effects of ligand production and DCo consumption. As a result of these combined effects, the calculated concentrations of inorganic Co ([Co']) were very low in the subtropical and subantarctic surface waters, generally between 10(-19) and 10(-17) M. In intermediate and deep waters, the South African margins can be a source of organic ligands, as it was suggested to be for DCo (Bown et al., 2011), although a significant portion of DCo (up to 15\%) can be stabilized and transported as inorganic species in those DCo-enriched water-masses. Contrastingly, the distribution of L does not suggest an intense biological production of L around the Antarctic Polar Front where a diatom bloom had recently occurred. Here [Co'] can be several orders of magnitude higher than those reported in the subtropical domain, suggesting that cobalt limitation was unlikely in the ACC domain. The almost invariant L:DCo ratio of similar to 1 recorded in these surface waters also reflected the conservative behaviours of both L and DCo. In deeper waters higher ligand concentrations were observed in waters previously identified as DCo sources (Bown et al., 2011). At those depths the eastward increase of DCo from the Drake Passage to the Greenwich Meridian could be associated with a large scale transport and remineralisation of DCo as organic complexes; here, the fraction stabilized as inorganic Co was also significant (up to 25\%) in the low oxygenated Upper Circumpolar Deep Waters. Organic speciation may thus be a central factor in the biogeochemical cycle of DCo in those areas, playing a major role in the bioavailability and the geochemistry of Co.},

  abstract = {A previous study based on data from a NE Atlantic site provided evidence, using an existing foodweb/vertical-flux modelling approach, that the size-structure of the phytoplankton community — rather than primary production — can be the dominant control on downward particulate organic carbon (POC) flux. In order to assess whether taking community structure into account can also provide more reliable estimates of downward POC flux in other oceanic provinces, epipelagic observations (mainly size-fractionated primary production, biomass, community structure data and heterotrophic bacterial production) and POC flux data from deep-moored sediment traps were collated from the six different ocean regions for which suitable data are available. At each site the epipelagic data were used in conjunction with two standard versions of the foodweb/vertical-flux model (one permits direct sinking of large ungrazed algae out of surface waters, the other does not) and published empirical depth/POCflux algorithms to predict the POC flux to the deep ocean. Predictions were also made using published primary-production/POC-flux algorithms, and the two sets of predictions were compared to the deep-ocean POC flux measurements. While the version of the foodweb/ vertical-flux model permitting the direct sinking of ungrazed algae provided the most reliable predictor of POC flux for five of the six sites, no conventional algorithm provided comparable predictions for more than two sites. The reliability of these predictions is discussed in the context of recent modelling studies that explore the extent to which flow fields in the water column overlying deep-moored sediment traps confound attempts to relate particle flux measurements to observations of surface-water processes. The present study suggests that the sinking of ungrazed large cells, probably diatoms, may be the key determinant of the magnitude of the downward POC flux in a variety of ocean regions. Planned ocean-observing programmes may provide sufficient epipelagic data to allow this approach to be used to improve the accuracy of basin-scale estimates of downward POC flux and hence reduce the uncertainty of the magnitude of this flux within the oceanic carbon budget.},

  abstract = {Sinking biogenic particles are centers of remineralization in the ocean's interior, a stratum which has large vertical biogeochemical gradients in the mesopelagic (i.e., 100–1000 m depth) realm. Due to difficulties in studying this region, our understanding of particle remineralization is based upon investigations employing biogeochemical algorithms, proxies, or shipboard incubations of deep-water samples. Here we circumvent many of these issues by fabricating and deploying a REspiration of Sinking Particles In the subsuRface ocEan (RESPIRE) particle interceptor in the open ocean to nonintrusively intercept settling particles at fixed depths (100–300 m). After a preprogrammed particle interception phase, the RESPIRE interceptor switches to a particle incubation mode, during which remineralization rate at in situ temperature and pressure is tracked using a dissolved-oxygen optode time series. A rotating (every 10 min) indented sphere transfers particles into a chamber that houses the dissolved-oxygen optode, and minimizes access to particles by mesozooplankton. Deployments of typically 72 h (36 h interception: 36 h incubation) yield rates of particle remineralization primarily by attached microbes, and concurrently provide samples for geochemical analyses and microbial assays to explore the relationship between bacterial community structure, enzymatic solubilisation, and trends in particle remineralization. The interceptor has also been used to follow temporal changes in microbial dynamics associated with remineralization. RESPIRE provides more realistic conditions within which remineralization rates can be measured in the ocean's interior, and will foster new linkages between the disparate disciplines of microbial physiology and particle biogeochemistry in the ocean's Twilight Zone.},

  abstract = {We developed a synthesis using diverse monitoring and modeling data for Mattawoman Creek, Maryland, USA to examine responses of this tidal freshwater tributary of the Potomac River estuary to a sharp reduction in point-source nutrient loading rate. Oligotrophication of these systems is not well understood; questions concerning recovery pathways, threshold responses, and lag times remain to be clarified and eventually generalized for application to other systems. Prior to load reductions Mattawoman Creek was eutrophic with poor water clarity (Secchi depth {$<$}0.5 m), no submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and large algal stocks (50–100 μg L−1 chlorophyll-a). A substantial modification to a wastewater treatment plant reduced annual average nitrogen (N) loads from 30 to 12 g N m−2 year−1 and phosphorus (P) loads from 3.7 to 1.6 g P m−2 year−1. Load reductions for both N and P were initiated in 1991 and completed by 1995. There was no trend in diffuse N and P loads between 1985 and 2010. Following nutrient load reduction, NO2 + NO3 and chlorophyll-a decreased and Secchi depth and SAV coverage and density increased with initial response lag times of one, four, three, one, and one year, respectively. A preliminary N budget was developed and indicated the following: diffuse sources currently dominate N inputs, estimates of long-term burial and denitrification were not large enough to balance the budget, sediment recycling of NH4 was the single largest term in the budget, SAV uptake of N from sediments and water provided a modest seasonal-scale N sink, and the creek system acted as an N sink for imported Potomac River nitrogen. Finally, using a comparative approach utilizing data from other shallow, low-salinity Chesapeake Bay ecosystems, strong relationships were found between N loading and algal biomass and between algal biomass and water clarity, two key water quality variables used as indices of restoration in Chesapeake Bay.},

These characteristics make it an excellent model system for studying the early evolution of metabolism. Here we present the whole-genome metabolic network of this organism and examine in detail the driving forces that have shaped it. We make extensive use of phylometabolic analysis, a method we recently introduced that generates trees of metabolic phenotypes by integrating phylogenetic and metabolic constraints. We reconstruct the evolution of a range of metabolic sub-systems, including the reductive citric acid (rTCA) cycle, as well as the biosynthesis and functional roles of several amino acids and cofactors. We show that A. aeolicus uses the reconstructed ancestral pathways within many of these sub-systems, and highlight how the evolutionary interconnections between sub-systems facilitated several key innovations. Our analyses further highlight three general classes of driving forces in metabolic evolution. One is the duplication and divergence of genes for enzymes as these progress from lower to higher substrate specificity, improving the kinetics of certain sub-systems. A second is the kinetic optimization of established pathways through fusion of enzymes, or their organization into larger complexes. The third is the minimization of the ATP unit cost to synthesize biomass, improving thermodynamic efficiency. Quantifying the distribution of these classes of innovations across metabolic sub-systems and across the tree of life will allow us to assess how a tradeoff between maximizing growth rate and growth efficiency has shaped the long-term metabolic evolution of the biosphere.},

  abstract = {Our view of marine microbes is transforming, as culture-independent methods facilitate rapid characterization of microbial diversity. It is difficult to assimilate this information into our understanding of marine microbe ecology and evolution, because their distributions, traits, and genomes are shaped by forces that are complex and dynamic. Here we incorporate diverse forces—physical, biogeochemical, ecological, and mutational—into a global ocean model to study selective pressures on a simple trait in a widely distributed lineage of picophytoplankton: the nitrogen use abilities of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus cyanobacteria. Some Prochlorococcus ecotypes have lost the ability to use nitrate, whereas their close relatives, marine Synechococcus, typically retain it. We impose mutations for the loss of nitrogen use abilities in modeled picophytoplankton, and ask: in which parts of the ocean are mutants most disadvantaged by losing the ability to use nitrate, and in which parts are they least disadvantaged? Our model predicts that this selective disadvantage is smallest for picophytoplankton that live in tropical regions where Prochlorococcus are abundant in the real ocean. Conversely, the selective disadvantage of losing the ability to use nitrate is larger for modeled picophytoplankton that live at higher latitudes, where Synechococcus are abundant. In regions where we expect Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus populations to cycle seasonally in the real ocean, we find that model ecotypes with seasonal population dynamics similar to Prochlorococcus are less disadvantaged by losing the ability to use nitrate than model ecotypes with seasonal population dynamics similar to Synechococcus. The model predictions for the selective advantage associated with nitrate use are broadly consistent with the distribution of this ability among marine picocyanobacteria, and at finer scales, can provide insights into interactions between temporally varying ocean processes and selective pressures that may be difficult or impossible to study by other means. More generally, and perhaps more importantly, this study introduces an approach for testing hypotheses about the processes that underlie genetic variation among marine microbes, embedded in the dynamic physical, chemical, and biological forces that generate and shape this diversity.},

  abstract = {Beneath the waves, oxygen disappears As plastic waste pollutes the oceans and fish stocks decline, unseen below the surface another problem grows: deoxygenation. Breitburg et al. review the evidence for the downward trajectory of oxygen levels in increasing areas of the open ocean and coastal waters. Rising nutrient loads coupled with climate change—each resulting from human activities—are changing ocean biogeochemistry and increasing oxygen consumption. This results in destabilization of sediments and fundamental shifts in the availability of key nutrients. In the short term, some compensatory effects may result in improvements in local fisheries, such as in cases where stocks are squeezed between the surface and elevated oxygen minimum zones. In the longer term, these conditions are unsustainable and may result in ecosystem collapses, which ultimately will cause societal and economic harm. Science, this issue p. eaam7240 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDOxygen concentrations in both the open ocean and coastal waters have been declining since at least the middle of the 20th century. This oxygen loss, or deoxygenation, is one of the most important changes occurring in an ocean increasingly modified by human activities that have raised temperatures, CO2 levels, and nutrient inputs and have altered the abundances and distributions of marine species. Oxygen is fundamental to biological and biogeochemical processes in the ocean. Its decline can cause major changes in ocean productivity, biodiversity, and biogeochemical cycles. Analyses of direct measurements at sites around the world indicate that oxygen-minimum zones in the open ocean have expanded by several million square kilometers and that hundreds of coastal sites now have oxygen concentrations low enough to limit the distribution and abundance of animal populations and alter the cycling of important nutrients. ADVANCESIn the open ocean, global warming, which is primarily caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, is considered the primary cause of ongoing deoxygenation. Numerical models project further oxygen declines during the 21st century, even with ambitious emission reductions. Rising global temperatures decrease oxygen solubility in water, increase the rate of oxygen consumption via respiration, and are predicted to reduce the introduction of oxygen from the atmosphere and surface waters into the ocean interior by increasing stratification and weakening ocean overturning circulation.In estuaries and other coastal systems strongly influenced by their watershed, oxygen declines have been caused by increased loadings of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and organic matter, primarily from agriculture; sewage; and the combustion of fossil fuels. In many regions, further increases in nitrogen discharges to coastal waters are projected as human populations and agricultural production rise. Climate change exacerbates oxygen decline in coastal systems through similar mechanisms as those in the open ocean, as well as by increasing nutrient delivery from watersheds that will experience increased precipitation.Expansion of low-oxygen zones can increase production of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas; reduce eukaryote biodiversity; alter the structure of food webs; and negatively affect food security and livelihoods. Both acidification and increasing temperature are mechanistically linked with the process of deoxygenation and combine with low-oxygen conditions to affect biogeochemical, physiological, and ecological processes. However, an important paradox to consider in predicting large-scale effects of future deoxygenation is that high levels of productivity in nutrient-enriched coastal systems and upwelling areas associated with oxygen-minimum zones also support some of the world’s most prolific fisheries. OUTLOOKMajor advances have been made toward understanding patterns, drivers, and consequences of ocean deoxygenation, but there is a need to improve predictions at large spatial and temporal scales important to ecosystem services provided by the ocean. Improved numerical models of oceanographic processes that control oxygen depletion and the large-scale influence of altered biogeochemical cycles are needed to better predict the magnitude and spatial patterns of deoxygenation in the open ocean, as well as feedbacks to climate. Developing and verifying the next generation of these models will require increased in situ observations and improved mechanistic understanding on a variety of scales. Models useful for managing nutrient loads can simulate oxygen loss in coastal waters with some skill, but their ability to project future oxygen loss is often hampered by insufficient data and climate model projections on drivers at appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Predicting deoxygenation-induced changes in ecosystem services and human welfare requires scaling effects that are measured on individual organisms to populations, food webs, and fisheries stocks; considering combined effects of deoxygenation and other ocean stressors; and placing an increased research emphasis on developing nations. Reducing the impacts of other stressors may provide some protection to species negatively affected by low-oxygen conditions. Ultimately, though, limiting deoxygenation and its negative effects will necessitate a substantial global decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as reductions in nutrient discharges to coastal waters. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science-sciencemag-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/content/sci/359/6371/eaam7240/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Low and declining oxygen levels in the open ocean and coastal waters affect processes ranging from biogeochemistry to food security.The global map indicates coastal sites where anthropogenic nutrients have exacerbated or caused O2 declines to {$<$}2 mg liter−1 ({$<$}63 μmol liter−1) (red dots), as well as ocean oxygen-minimum zones at 300 m of depth (blue shaded regions). [Map created from data provided by R. Diaz, updated by members of the GO2NE network, and downloaded from the World Ocean Atlas 2009]. Oxygen is fundamental to life. Not only is it essential for the survival of individual animals, but it regulates global cycles of major nutrients and carbon. The oxygen content of the open ocean and coastal waters has been declining for at least the past half-century, largely because of human activities that have increased global temperatures and nutrients discharged to coastal waters. These changes have accelerated consumption of oxygen by microbial respiration, reduced solubility of oxygen in water, and reduced the rate of oxygen resupply from the atmosphere to the ocean interior, with a wide range of biological and ecological consequences. Further research is needed to understand and predict long-term, global- and regional-scale oxygen changes and their effects on marine and estuarine fisheries and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {A three-component model was developed which calculates the fractional contributions of three phytoplankton size classes (micro-, nano- and picoplankton) to the overall chlorophyll-a concentration in the Atlantic Ocean. The model is an extension of the Sathyendranath et al. (2001) approach, based on the assumption that small cells dominate at low chlorophyll-a concentrations and large cells at high chlorophyll-a concentrations. Diagnostic pigments were used to infer cell size using an established technique adapted to account for small picoeukaroytes in ultra-oligotrophic environments. Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) pigment data taken between 1997 and 2004 were split into two datasets; 1935 measurements were used to parameterise the model, and a further 241 surface measurements, spatially and temporally matched to chlorophyll-a derived from SeaWiFS satellite data, were set aside to validate the model. Comparison with an independent global pigment dataset (256 measurements) also supports the broader-scale application of the model. The effect of optical depth on the model parameters was also investigated and explicitly incorporated into the model. It is envisaged that future applications would include validating multi-plankton biogeochemical models and improving primary-production estimates by accounting for community composition.},

Results indicate a convergence of the particle size distributions of OC and 234Th during the winter-spring bloom period (January-March, 2007). The observed convergence of these particle size distributions is directly correlated to the depth-integrated abundance of autotrophic pico-eukaryotes (r = 0.97, P {$<$} 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, Synechococcus (r = 0.85, P {$<$} 0.14). In addition, there are positive correlations between the sediment trap flux of OC and 234Th at 150 m and the depth-integrated abundance of pico-eukaryotes (r = 0.94, P {$<$} 0.06 for OC, and r = 0.98, P {$<$} 0.05 for 234Th) and Synechococcus (r = 0.95, P {$<$} 0.05 for OC, and r = 0.94, P {$<$} 0.06 for 234Th). An implication of these observations and recent modeling studies (Richardson and Jackson, 2007) is that, although small in size, pico-plankton may influence large particle export from the surface waters of the subtropical Atlantic.},

At the height of the diatom bloom, aggregates were observed as spikes in measurements of both particulate backscattering coefficient (bbp) and chlorophyll a fluorescence. Optical sensors on the ship and gliders were cross-calibrated through a series of simultaneous profiles, and bbp was converted to particulate organic carbon. The aggregates sank as a discrete pulse, with an average sinking rate of ∼75 m d−1; 65\% of aggregate backscattering and 90\% of chlorophyll fluorescence content was lost between 100 m and 900 m. Mean aggregate organic carbon flux at 100 m in mid-May was estimated at 514 mg C m−2 d−1, consistent with independent flux estimates. The use of optical spikes observed from gliders provides unprecedented coupled vertical and temporal resolution measurements of an aggregate flux event.},

  abstract = {Breaking up is easy to do Sinking particles transport carbon to the seafloor, where they are buried in sediments and either provide food for benthic organisms or sequester the carbon they contain. However, only ∼30\% of the maximum flux reaches depths of a kilometer. This loss cannot be fully accounted for by current measurements. Briggs et al. used data collected by robotic Biogeochemical-Argo floats to quantify total mesopelagic fragmentation and found that this process accounts for roughly half of the observed flux loss (see the Perspective by Nayak and Twardowski). Fragmentation is thus perhaps the most important process controlling the remineralization of sinking organic carbon. Science, this issue p. 791; see also p. 738 A critical driver of the ocean carbon cycle is the downward flux of sinking organic particles, which acts to lower the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. This downward flux is reduced by more than 70\% in the mesopelagic zone (100 to 1000 meters of depth), but this loss cannot be fully accounted for by current measurements. For decades, it has been hypothesized that the missing loss could be explained by the fragmentation of large aggregates into small particles, although data to test this hypothesis have been lacking. In this work, using robotic observations, we quantified total mesopelagic fragmentation during 34 high-flux events across multiple ocean regions and found that fragmentation accounted for 49 ± 22\% of the observed flux loss. Therefore, fragmentation may be the primary process controlling the sequestration of sinking organic carbon. Robotic measurements show that fragmentation of sinking particles exerts a major control on ocean CO2 storage.

However, the results of surveillance may not be available on a timescale that is optimal for guiding patient treatment. Here we present a method for inferring characteristics of an unknown bacterial sample by identifying the presence of sequence variation across the genome that is linked to a phenotype of interest, in this case drug resistance. We demonstrate an implementation of this principle using sequence k-mer content, matched to a database of known genomes. We show this technique can be applied to data from an Oxford Nanopore device in real time and is capable of identifying the presence of a known resistant strain in 5 minutes, even from a complex metagenomic sample. This flexible approach has wide application to pathogen surveillance and may be used to greatly accelerate diagnoses of resistant infections.},

We conclude there is a need for fundamental change in how we educate graduate students in the ocean sciences. The change should accommodate the interests of students as well as the needs of a changing society; the change should not be constrained by the traditions or resource challenges of the graduate institutions themselves. The limited data we have been able to obtain from schools and employers are consistent with this view: desirable careers for ocean scientists are moving rapidly toward interdisciplinary, collaborative, societally relevant activities, away from traditional academic-research/professorial jobs, but the training available to the students is not keeping pace. We offer some suggestions to mitigate the mismatch. Most importantly, although anecdotes and “gut feelings” abound, the quantitative data backing our conclusions and suggestions are very sparse and barely compelling; we urge better data collection to support curricular revision, perhaps with the involvement of professional societies.},

  abstract = {Ecological theory on biological invasions attempts to characterize the predictors of invasion success and the relative importance of the different drivers of population establishment. An outstanding question is how propagule pressure determines the probability of population establishment, where propagule pressure is the number of individuals of a species introduced into a specific location (propagule size) and their frequency of introduction (propagule number). Here, we used large-scale replicated mesocosm ponds over three reproductive seasons to identify how propagule size and number predict the probability of establishment of one of world's most invasive fish, Pseudorasbora parva, as well as its effect on the somatic growth of individuals during establishment. We demonstrated that, although a threshold of 11 introduced pairs of fish (a pair is 1 male, 1 female) was required for establishment probability to exceed 95\%, establishment also occurred at low propagule size (1–5 pairs). Although single introduction events were as effective as multiple events at enabling establishment, the propagule sizes used in the multiple introductions were above the detected threshold for establishment. After three reproductive seasons, population abundance was also a function of propagule size, with rapid increases in abundance only apparent when propagule size exceeded 25 pairs. This was initially assisted by adapted biological traits, including rapid individual somatic growth that helped to overcome demographic bottlenecks.},

Here we show how virus-derived sequences contained in CRISPRs are used by CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins from the host to mediate an antiviral response that counteracts infection. After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation. Our results demonstrate that the formation of mature guide RNAs by the CRISPR RNA endonuclease subunit of Cascade is a mechanistic requirement for antiviral defense.},

While the physical and biogeochemical variables are forecast mechanistically using the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the Chesapeake Bay, the species predictions are generated using a novel mechanistic–empirical approach, whereby real-time output from the coupled physical–biogeochemical model drives multivariate empirical habitat models of the target species. The predictions, in the form of digital images, are available via the World Wide Web to interested groups to guide recreational, management, and research activities. Though full validation of the integrated forecasts for all species is still a work in progress, we argue that the mechanistic–empirical approach can be used to generate a wide variety of short-term ecological forecasts, and that it can be applied in any marine system where sufficient data exist to develop empirical habitat models. This paper provides an overview of this system, its predictions, and the approach taken.},

Both sets of analyses revealed considerable sequence variation, which, along with bootstrap calculations, strongly support the discrimination of 3 ‘species’ level clusters (i.e. displaying {$<$}98\% within-cluster and {$>$}97\% between-cluster 16S rRNA gene sequence identity) within this clade, which are here designated as MGB/SAR324 clade groups I and II and the MGB/SAR276 clade. The biogeographical ranges of these 3 clades were analyzed using newly acquired 16S and ITS sequences from Stn ALOHA (22.45°N, 158°W), along with sequences available in the public domain. MGB/SAR324 clade group I and the MBG/SAR276 clade display a clearly restricted distribution, occurring only in tropical and subtropical waters at depths {$<$}250 m. These groups represent the first reported species- and genus-level phylotypes displaying a ‘tropical-only’ global distribution. MGB/SAR324 clade group II, which has been previously described as ubiquitous, occurs across the latitudinal gradient, but is generally restricted to deep, colder waters in the lower latitudes. Enzyme sequences associated at least with MGB/SAR324 clade group II appear to indicate a role for this group in dissolved organic phosphate cycling.},

  abstract = {The ubiquitous SAR11 bacterial clade is the most abundant type of organism in the world’s oceans, but the reasons for its success are not fully elucidated. We analysed 128 surface marine metagenomes, including 37 new Antarctic metagenomes. The large size of the data set enabled internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions to be obtained from the Southern polar region, enabling the first global characterization of the distribution of SAR11, from waters spanning temperatures −2 to 30°C. Our data show a stable co-occurrence of phylotypes within both ‘tropical’ ({$>$}20°C) and ‘polar’ ({$<$}10°C) biomes, highlighting ecological niche differentiation between major SAR11 subgroups. All phylotypes display transitions in abundance that are strongly correlated with temperature and latitude. By assembling SAR11 genomes from Antarctic metagenome data, we identified specific genes, biases in gene functions and signatures of positive selection in the genomes of the polar SAR11—genomic signatures of adaptive radiation. Our data demonstrate the importance of adaptive radiation in the organism’s ability to proliferate throughout the world’s oceans, and describe genomic traits characteristic of different phylotypes in specific marine biomes.},

Surface samples were collected approximately every 10 km along 170°W during two N–S transects, separated in time by two weeks. Phytoplankton abundance and size structure varied with distinct latitudinal trends. Autotrophic biomass was lowest north of the Polar Front reflecting the dominance of small cells. The highest biomass (170 μg C l−1) occurred at 65°S where the composition was strongly influenced by large centric diatoms. Farther south, the diatom community shifted to the dominance of smaller pennate diatoms. Total grazer biomass and size distributions followed similar patterns, ranging from 4 μg C l−1 in the north to 52 μg C l−1 in the south where larger (\&gt;20 μm) grazers were more abundant. Heterotrophic bacteria varied over an order of magnitude in abundance across the study site, with size generally increasing from north to south. In the second transect, phytoplankton biomass at 65°S was 50\% lower, and grazer biomass and bacterial populations were slightly greater, indicating the decline of the bloom. The changes in biomass and community structure along 170°W and the reduction of phytoplankton standing stock at 65°S over time suggests adjacent, yet different, microbial systems in terms of carbon flux, spanning from primarily recycling to export-dominated.},

The V9 region of the SSU rRNA gene was amplified from samples representing the epi- (10 m), meso- (800 m) and bathy- (4400 m) pelagia. The primers used are expected to amplify representatives of B80\% of known phylogenetic diversity across all three domains. Comparisons of unique sequences revealed a remarkably low degree of overlap between communities at each depth. The 444 147 sequence tags analyzed represented 62 975 unique sequences. Of these, 3707 (5.9\%) occurred at two depths, and only 298 (0.5\%) were observed at all three depths. At this level of phylogenetic resolution, Bacteria diversity decreased with depth but was still equivalent to that reported elsewhere for different soil types. Archaea diversity was highest in the two deeper samples. Eucarya observations and richness estimates are almost one order of magnitude higher than any previous marine microbial Eucarya richness estimates. The associations of many Eucarya sequences with putative parasitic organisms may have significant impacts on our understanding of the mechanisms controlling host population density and diversity, and point to a more significant role for microbial Eucarya in carbon flux through the microbial loop. We posit that the majority of sequences detected from the deep sea that have closest matches to sequences from non-pelagic sources are indeed native to the marine environment, and are possibly responsible for key metabolic processes in global biogeochemical cycles.

  abstract = {The supply of iron, relative to that of the macronutrients nitrate, phosphate, and silicic acid, plays a critical role in allowing extensive diatom blooms to develop in coastal upwelling regimes. The presence or absence of a broad continental shelf influences the supply of iron. The iron input to central California upwelling waters varies spatially and can be characterized by two end-member regimes. One end member, which includes Monterey Bay and extending north to Pt. Reyes, is an iron-replete regime where upwelling occurs over a relatively broad continental shelf that results in waters with high concentrations of dissolved and particulate iron ({$>$}10 nM) entrained together with high concentrations of nitrate and silicic acid. In these iron-replete regions, extensive blooms of large diatoms deplete macronutrient concentrations, which results in correspondingly high chlorophyll a concentrations. The other end member, located to the south of Monterey Bay off the Big Sur coast, is an iron-deplete regime where upwelling is focused offshore of a narrow continental shelf. Upwelled waters in the Big Sur region are characterized by low dissolved and particulate iron concentrations ({$<$}1 nM), together with high concentrations of nitrate and silicic acid. Extremely low iron concentrations, unused nitrate and silicic acid, and a low abundance of large diatoms characterize surface waters in these iron-deplete regions, and thus represent coastal upwelling, high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll systems limited by the micronutrient iron.},

Protein cluster cataloging defined pelagic upper-ocean viral community pan and core gene sets and suggested that this sequence space is well-sampled. Analyses of viral protein clusters, populations, and morphology revealed biogeographic patterns whereby viral communities were passively transported on oceanic currents and locally structured by environmental conditions that affect host community structure. Together, these investigations establish a global ocean dsDNA viromic data set with analyses supporting the seed-bank hypothesis to explain how oceanic viral communities maintain high local diversity.},

During the first 30 m of downflow in Reigous creek issuing from the mine tailings, 20 to 60\% of the dissolved arsenic is removed by coprecipitation with Fe(III). The microbial communities along the creek have been characterized using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and 16S rRNA gene library analyses. The results indicate a low bacterial diversity in comparison with unpolluted water. Eighty percent of the sequences obtained are related to sequences from uncultured, newly described organisms or recently associated with acid mine drainage. As expected owing to the water chemistry, the sequences recovered are mainly related to bacteria involved in the geochemical Fe and S cycles. Among them, sequences related to uncultured TrefC4 affiliated with Gallionella ferruginea, a neutrophilic Fe-oxidizing bacterium, are dominant.

  abstract = {The silica cycle within particles of marine snow from coastal waters off central California was examined. The ratios of biogenic silica to particulate organic nitrogen and to particulate org.anic carbon in aggregates were significantly greater than Redfield ratios, suggesting a large detrital silica component within the particles. Silicic acid concentrations within aggregates were ∼10-fold greater on average than those in the surrounding seawater, with interstitial concentrations up to 305 µM Si(OH)4. Silica production rates within aggregates were sufficient to deplete the interstitial silicic acid in 0.3–4.0 h, suggesting rapid cycling of Si within the aggregates. Efflux of Si(OH)4 from the aggregates predicted from molecular diffusion theory was 20-fold greater than the known maximum possible rates of silica dissolution could support. Congruence between efflux rates predicted by diffusion theory and dissolution kinetics requires the diffusion coefficient for Si(OH)4 in marine snow to be 2 orders of magnitude less than in pure seawater. Experimental determination of the concentration dependence of silicic acid use by diatoms in aggregates and by those in the surrounding seawater indicated that assemblages from both environments would experience Si-replete conditions within marine snow. Aggregation of diatoms following silicic acid depletion at the end of blooms may provide Si-replete microhabitats suitable for the formation of the heavily silicified resting spores that are central to the life-history of many species.},

Blooms vary considerably in terms of eukaryotic species composition and environmental conditions, but a limited number of heterotrophic bacterial lineages — primarily members of the Flavobacteriia, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria — dominate these communities. In this Review, we discuss the central role that these bacteria have in transforming phytoplankton-derived organic matter and thus in biogeochemical nutrient cycling. On the basis of selected field and laboratory-based studies of flavobacteria and roseobacters, distinct metabolic strategies are emerging for these archetypal phytoplankton-associated taxa, which provide insights into the underlying mechanisms that dictate their behaviours during blooms.

While most studies have focused on C input, little attention has been paid to plant invasion effects on soil respiration, especially in wetland ecosystems. Our study examined the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil respiration and C dynamics in the Yangtze River estuary. The estuary was originally occupied by two native plant species: Phragmites australis in the high tide zone and Scirpus mariqueter in the low tide zone. Mean soil respiration rates were 185.8 and 142.3 mg CO2 m−2 h−1 in S. alterniflora and P. australis stands in the high tide zone, and 159.7 and 112.0 mg CO2 m−2 h−1 in S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter stands in the low tide zone, respectively. Aboveground NPP (ANPP), SOC, and microbial biomass were also significantly higher in the S. alterniflora stands than in the two native plant stands. S. alterniflora invasion did not significantly change soil inorganic carbon or pH. Our results indicated that enhanced ANPP by S. alterniflora exceeded invasion-induced C loss through soil respiration. This suggests that S. alterniflora invasion into the Yangtze River estuary could strengthen the net C sink of wetlands in the context of global climate change.},

  abstract = {This review provides an assessment of sediment trap accuracy issues by gathering data to address trap hydrodynamics, the problem of zooplankton “swimmers,” and the solubilization of material after collection. For each topic, the problem is identified, its magnitude and causes reviewed using selected examples, and an update on methods to correct for the potential bias or minimize the problem using new technologies is presented. To minimize hydrodynamic biases due to flow over the trap mouth, the use of neutrally buoyant sediment traps is encouraged. The influence of swimmers is best minimized using traps that limit zooplankton access to the sample collection chamber. New data on the impact of different swimmer removal protocols at the US time-series sites HOT and BATS are compared and shown to be important. Recent data on solubilization are compiled and assessed suggesting selective losses from sinking particles to the trap supernatant after collection, which may alter both fluxes and ratios of elements in long term and typically deeper trap deployments. Different methods are needed to assess shallow and short- term trap solubilization effects, but thus far new incubation experiments suggest these impacts to be small for most elements. A discussion of trap calibration methods reviews independent assessments of flux, including elemental budgets, particle abundance and flux modeling, and emphasizes the utility of U-Th radionuclide calibration methods.},

  abstract = {We examined the impact of a cyclonic eddy and mode-water eddy on particle flux in the Sargasso Sea. The primary method used to quantify flux was based on measurements of the natural radionuclide, Th-234, and these flux estimates were compared to results from sediment traps in both eddies, and a Po-210/Pb-210 flux method in the mode-water eddy. Particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes at 150m ranged 1-4 mmol Cm-2 d(-1) and were comparable between methods, especially considering differences in integration times scales of each approach. Our main conclusion is that relative to summer mean conditions at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site, eddy-driven changes in biogeochemistry did not enhance local POC fluxes during this later, more mature stage of the eddy life cycle ({$>$} 6 months old). The absence of an enhancement in POC flux puts a constraint on the timing of higher POC flux events, which are thought to have caused the local O-2 minima below each eddy, and must have taken place {$>$} 2 months prior to our arrival. The mode-water eddy did enhance preferentially diatom biomass in its center, where we estimated a factor of three times higher biogenic Si flux than the BATS summer average. An unexpected finding in the highly depth-resolved Th-234 data sets is narrow layers of particle export and remineralization within the eddy. In particular, a strong excess Th-234 signal is seen below the deep chlorophyll maxima, which we attribute to remineralization of Th-234-bearing particles. At this depth below the euphotic zone, de novo particle production in the euphotic zone has stopped, yet particle remineralization continues via consumption of labile sinking material by bacteria and/or zooplankton. These data suggest that further study of processes in ocean layers is warranted not only within, but below the euphotic zone. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The oceanic biological pump drives sequestration of carbon dioxide in the deep sea via sinking particles. Rapid biological consumption and remineralization of carbon in the “twilight zone” (depths between the euphotic zone and 1000 meters) reduce the efficiency of sequestration. By using neutrally buoyant sediment traps to sample this chronically understudied realm, we measured a transfer efficiency of sinking particulate organic carbon between 150 and 500 meters of 20 and 50\% at two contrasting sites. This large variability in transfer efficiency is poorly represented in biogeochemical models. If applied globally, this is equivalent to a difference in carbon sequestration of more than 3 petagrams of carbon per year.},

  abstract = {During field measurements in a bloom of Emiliania huxleyi in the North Sea in 1993, an apparently inconsistent combination of observations was measured: (1)fCO2 was lower in the center of the bloom than in the surrounding nonbloom areas and undersaturated with respect to the atmosphere in both cases, (2) within the bloom, enhanced sedimentation of coccoliths-containing fecal pellets was observed, (3) a large atmospheric sink of 1.3 mol C m−2 was derived, and (4) in the same bloom a positive correlation between CaCO3 and fCO2 was observed, which was interpreted as an increase of fCO2 during production of CaCO3. In order to resolve the inconsistency between observations (1, 2, 3) and 4 a one-dimensional three-layer model was constructed. A positive correlation between CaCO3 and fCO2 was obtained when the model was parameterized with data obtained from field and mesocosm studies. The correlation is a feature of the decay phase of a bloom and represents a decrease of fCO2 with a decrease Of CaCO3. Thus it represents the dissolution and sedimentation of CaCO3 rather than its production. Having resolved the ambiguity within the field data by adding the dimension of time in the model, blooms of E. huxleyi can be identified as sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide. This sink is a function of the calcification to photosynthesis (C:P) ratio of the nitrate-using phytoplankton and is maximal when the C:P ratio is 0.42 (that is, E. huxleyi constitutes 97\% of the nitrate-using phytoplankton). Rather than using the model for making accurate predictions about the magnitude of this sink, a sensitivity analysis was performed to give a range of magnitudes for the range of parameter values that were obtained during previous studies. Furthermore, gaps were identified in the current knowledge of carbon fluxes within blooms of E. huxleyi.},

Over a 2-year period, we measured microcystin concentrations in water, sediment and biota (fish and shellfish) at both sites. Across both food webs we found highest levels of microcystin among consumers of suspended particulate matter, including planktivorous fishes and filter-feeding shellfish, and lower levels of toxin among piscivores, scavengers and benthic omnivores. Despite similar levels of microcystin in the water column at the two sites, we observed higher toxin levels in fish and sediments of the Curonian Lagoon. We attribute this difference to the legacy of prior toxic cyanobacteria blooms in the Curonian Lagoon and hydrologic factors that result in a predominance of autochthonously-derived organic matter in the sediments at this site. Our results suggest that a consideration of species-specific differences in feeding habits, and organic matter sources supporting food webs are important to understanding the accumulation and persistence of algal toxins in food webs and should therefore be considered in assessment of risks to aquatic biota and human health.},

These methods have found many applications in general ecology, but their importance has grown considerably in recent years, driven by the introduction of high-throughput DNA sequencing into microbial ecology. We examine the state of the art in terms of estimating the total number of taxa in a microbial population from a sample of sequences. We focus mainly on estimating the number of species within a single population (α-diversity), but we also briefly consider statistical inference for comparing the numbers of species across populations (β-diversity). We discuss the full range of statistical techniques, parametric and nonparametric as well as frequentist and Bayesian, and specific implications of their use in microbial diversity studies. We conclude with some recommendations for theoretical investigation and computational tool development.},

Here, we analyze in situ laser diffraction measurements of the PSD from a variety of estuarine and open ocean systems. The power law or “Junge-type” distribution provided a good fit to surface ocean particle size distributions measured from 6 to 250 μm. PSD slopes ranged from 2.7 to 4.7 with a mean of 3.63. Consistent with theory, high particle slopes (3.78) and low particle concentrations characterized the open ocean waters of the Atlantic and the Southern Ocean. Lower PSD slopes (3.63) and high concentrations were characteristic of estuarine waters. River plumes consistently showed the lowest PSD slopes (3.30) and highest particle concentrations characteristic of larger bloom-forming phytoplankton and production of particle aggregates. In the North Atlantic, an inverse relationship was found between PSD slope and chlorophyll concentration. Such results follow the biological paradigm that larger phytoplankton are prevalent in bloom conditions and smaller phytoplankton dominate in oligotrophic water. Large temporal variability in PSD was observed in near coastal regions prone to sediment resuspension from storms and tidal flow. Dense sea grass beds consistently had lower particle concentrations compared to surrounding waters due to reductions in current flow and sediment resuspension. Simple power law approximations of particle size distributions can be successfully used to describe and assess particle distributions in a wide array of oceanic and estuarine water types.},

  abstract = {Glacial retreat is changing biogeochemical cycling in the Arctic, where glacial runoff contributes iron for oceanic shelf primary production. We hypothesize that in Svalbard fjords, microbes catalyze intense iron and sulfur cycling in low-organic-matter sediments. This is because low organic matter limits sulfide generation, allowing iron mobility to the water column instead of precipitation as iron monosulfides. In this study, we tested this with high-depth-resolution 16S rRNA gene libraries in the upper 20 cm at two sites in Van Keulenfjorden, Svalbard. At the site closer to the glaciers, iron-reducing Desulfuromonadales, iron-oxidizing Gallionella and Mariprofundus, and sulfur-oxidizing Thiotrichales and Epsilonproteobacteria were abundant above a 12-cm depth. Below this depth, the relative abundances of sequences for sulfate-reducing Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae increased. At the outer station, the switch from iron-cycling clades to sulfate reducers occurred at shallower depths (similar to 5 cm), corresponding to higher sulfate reduction rates. Relatively labile organic matter (shown by delta C-13 and C/N ratios) was more abundant at this outer site, and ordination analysis suggested that this affected microbial community structure in surface sediments. Network analysis revealed more correlations between predicted iron-and sulfur-cycling taxa and with uncultured clades proximal to the glacier. Together, these results suggest that complex microbial communities catalyze redox cycling of iron and sulfur, especially closer to the glacier, where sulfate reduction is limited due to low availability of organic matter. Diminished sulfate reduction in upper sediments enables iron to flux into the overlying water, where it may be transported to the shelf. IMPORTANCE Glacial runoff is a key source of iron for primary production in the Arctic. In the fjords of the Svalbard archipelago, glacial retreat is predicted to stimulate phytoplankton blooms that were previously restricted to outer margins. Decreased sediment delivery and enhanced primary production have been hypothesized to alter sediment biogeochemistry, wherein any free reduced iron that could potentially be delivered to the shelf will instead become buried with sulfide generated through microbial sulfate reduction. We support this hypothesis with sequencing data that showed increases in the relative abundance of sulfate reducing taxa and sulfate reduction rates with increasing distance from the glaciers in Van Keulenfjorden, Svalbard. Community structure was driven by organic geochemistry, suggesting that enhanced input of organic material will stimulate sulfate reduction in interior fjord sediments as glaciers continue to recede.},

One technique uses dimensional analysis to determine the dependence of the spectrum's slope with fractal dimension. In this paper, we use numerical simulations to examine the assumptions underlying the dimensional analysis approach to particle size spectra. We find that the slopes of numerically computed steady-state particle size spectra disagree with those predicted by dimensional analysis. The assumptions underlying the dimensional analysis approach that are responsible for the disagreement are as follows:\, only one coagulation mechanism operates in each particular particle size range, particle loss through sedimentation occurs at particle sizes larger than those for which differential sedimentation dominates, particles only interact with like-sized particles. Including disaggregation steepens the slope of the particle size spectrum for both large and small particles and changes the shape of the spectrum. These results indicate that one should exercise caution when using the measured slopes of particle size spectra to estimate aggregate fractal dimension.},

Aggregation theory not only provides a framework for understanding these processes, but it also provides a means for making predictions and has been successfully used to predict maximum particle concentrations in the oceans and the fate of diatom blooms (including those from iron fertilization), the size spectra of particles in the oceans, and the size distributions of trace metals.

  abstract = {Organic matter (OM) plays a major role in both terrestrial and oceanic biogeochemical cycles. The amount of carbon stored in these systems is far greater than that of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, and annual fluxes of CO2 from these pools to the atmosphere exceed those from fossil fuel combustion. Understanding the processes that determine the fate of detrital material is important for predicting the effects that climate change will have on feedbacks to the global carbon cycle. However, Earth System Models (ESMs) typically utilize very simple formulations of processes affecting the mineralization and storage of detrital OM. Recent changes in our view of the nature of this material and the factors controlling its transformation have yet to find their way into models. In this review, we highlight the current understanding of the role and cycling of detrital OM in terrestrial and marine systems and examine how this pool of material is represented in ESMs. We include a discussion of the different mineralization pathways available as organic matter moves from soils, through inland waters to coastal systems and ultimately into open ocean environments. We argue that there is strong commonality between aspects of OM transformation in both terrestrial and marine systems and that our respective scientific communities would benefit from closer collaboration.},

From crab cakes to sailboats, drinking water to naval ships, the Bay touches virtually every aspect of life in the region. The Bay has inspired literature, driven the regional economy, and shaped political decision making and development patterns for homes, industry, agriculture, and transportation. As population demands increase and urban boundaries expand into pristine landscapes, the sustainability of the Chesapeake Bay and its resources face unprecedented pressures. Consequently, the public's health also is vulnerable to Bay pollution and other stresses stemming from development activities and widespread growth occurring throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. This paper will examine the linkages between the environmental quality of the Bay and the population health status, recommend ways to bridge ecological and human health concerns in the context of the Bay, and finally present a framework for developing a public health report card for the Bay.},

  abstract = {Gel particles - a class of abundant transparent organic particles - have increasingly gathered attention in marine research. Field studies on the bacterial colonization of marine gels however are still scarce. So far most studies on respective particles have focused on the upper ocean while little is known on their occurrence in the deep sea. Here, we report on the vertical distribution of the two most common gel particle types, which are polysaccharide-containing transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and proteinaceous Coomassie stainable particles (CSP), as well as numbers of bacteria attached to gel particles throughout the water column, from the surface ocean down to the bathypelagial ({$<$} 3000 m). Our study was conducted in the Arctic Fram Strait during northern hemispheres' summer in 2015. Besides data on the bacterial colonization of the two gel particle types (TEP and CSP), we present bacterial densities on different gel particle size classes according to twelve different sampling depths at four sampling locations. Gel particles were frequently abundant at all sampled depths, their concentrations decreased from the euphotic zone to the dark ocean. They were colonized by bacteria at all sampled water depths; with risen importance at the deepest water layers, where fractions of bacteria attached to gel particles [\%] increased within the total bacterial community. Due to the omnipresent bacterial colonization of gel particles at all sampled depths in our study, we presume that euphotic production of this small organic matter may affect microbial species distribution within the whole water column in the Fram Strait, down to the deep sea. Our results raise the question if changes in the bacterial community composition and functioning on gel particles occur over depth, which may affect microbial respiration and remineralization rates of respective particles in different water layers.},

The results from Survey 1 indicated that online students reported significantly lower levels of relatedness than their on-campus counterparts. Follow-up interviews were conducted with purposefully chosen students and faculty members. The findings suggested that four themes impact synchronous hybrid learning: peer relatedness, technology influence, instructor impact, and program structure. In vivo quotations were used to develop a scale to assess participants' self-efficacy of relatedness development. Survey 2 data indicated that the new scale had good psychometric quality and that students reported significantly greater levels of self-efficacy for relatedness development with classmates in their same attendance mode than with peers in the opposite format.},

The simulations tend to overestimate the volume of the OMZs, especially in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere. Compared to observations, five models introduce incorrect meridional asymmetries in the distribution of oxygen including larger southern OMZ and weaker northern OMZ, due to interhemispheric biases in intermediate water mass ventilation. Seven models show too deep an extent of the tropical hypoxia compared to observations, stemming from a deficient equatorial ventilation in the upper ocean, combined with too large a biologically driven downward flux of particulate organic carbon at depth, caused by particle export from the euphotic layer that is too high and remineralization in the upper ocean that is too weak. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} At interannual timescales, the dynamics of oxygen in the eastern tropical Pacific OMZ is dominated by biological consumption and linked to natural variability in the Walker circulation. However, under the climate change scenario RCP8.5, all simulations yield small and discrepant changes in oxygen concentration at mid depths in the tropical Pacific by the end of the 21st century due to an almost perfect compensation between warming-related decrease in oxygen saturation and decrease in biological oxygen utilization. Climate change projections are at odds with recent observations that show decreasing oxygen levels at mid depths in the tropical Pacific. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Out of the OMZs, all the CMIP5 models predict a decrease of oxygen over most of the surface and deep ocean at low latitudes and over all depths at high latitudes due to an overall slow-down of ventilation and increased temperature.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

New methods control errors sufficiently such that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified independently from a reference database. Here we discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of closed-reference OTUs—including computational costs that scale linearly with study size, simple merging between independently processed data sets, and forward prediction—and of de novo OTUs—including accurate measurement of diversity and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference databases. We argue that the improvements in reusability, reproducibility and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great that ASVs should replace OTUs as the standard unit of marker-gene analysis and reporting.},

The majority of the ribotypes appearing as rRNA or rDNA were present at least 50\% of the time, and their variation over time was less than that of most biotic and abiotic factors. Even though there were no predictable seasonal patterns in community structure, environmental parameters explained between 40 and 50\% of the observed variation in community structure, In general, summer communities correlated positively with temperature, light, bacterial production, and phosphate levels, while winter communities correlated with dissolved organic carbon concentrations. The abundance of 3 select ribotypes (SAR11, a Cytophaga subgroup, SAR116-like) varied some over time as measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The SAR11 clade was 10 times more abundant than the other 2 groups. However, the 16S rRNA to rDNA ratios, as measured by qPCR and reverse transcription-qPCR, varied greatly over time and were highest in the SAR11 population and the Cytophaga subgroup. The rRNA to rDNA ratio of the Cytophaga subgroup and SAR116-like group significantly correlated with some environmental parameters. Taken together, these results suggest that the community composition of the major members does not change much over time, but individual members do vary in abundance and activity and can be influenced by environmental factors.},

Known protist diversity and biology is largely based on cultured strains. Yet, environmental molecular surveys have unveiled entirely novel lineages that, as their prokaryotic counterparts, are essentially uncultured. Culture bias is an important drawback for any microbe-related science and is particularly severe for heterotrophic protists, which depend on organic food sources for growth. Here, we show how ecologically significant bacterivorous protists have been brought into culture by mimicking in situ conditions. Single cells sorted by serial dilution or flow cytometry were inoculated into seawater amended with natural bacterial assemblage at nearly in situ abundances. Strains belonging to lineages only known so far from environmental sequencing were isolated. Among them, Minorisa minuta gen. nov. sp. nov. forms a novel branch within Rhizaria, holding a key evolutionary position, and with an average size of 1.4 μm represents one of the smallest bacterial grazers known to date. It has a worldwide planktonic distribution and can account for 5\% of heterotrophic protists communities in coastal waters. Physiological features of this strain can partly explain its success in the environment. Culturing ecologically relevant but elusive protists provide invaluable material for ecophysiology, genomics, ecosystem modeling and evolutionary issues.},

Through a combination of molecular techniques and process rate measurements, we showed that both sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation contribute to energy flux and elemental cycling in oxygen-free waters off the coast of northern Chile. These processes may have been overlooked because in nature, the sulfide produced by sulfate reduction immediately oxidizes back to sulfate. This cryptic sulfur cycle is linked to anammox and other nitrogen cycling processes, suggesting that it may influence biogeochemical cycling in the global ocean.},

Course evaluations revealed that students were demotivated and had more negative experiences in classes taught by fixed (versus growth) mindset faculty. Faculty mindset beliefs predicted student achievement and motivation above and beyond any other faculty characteristic, including their gender, race/ethnicity, age, teaching experience, or tenure status. These findings suggest that faculty mindset beliefs have important implications for the classroom experiences and achievement of underrepresented minority students in STEM.

Digital PCR technology provides direct, standards-free quantification and may potentially alleviate or greatly reduce other qPCR limitations such as difficulty in multiplexing and susceptibility to PCR inhibition. This study examined the efficacy of employing a duplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay that simultaneously quantifies Enterococcus spp. and the human fecal-associated HF183 marker for water quality assessment. Duplex ddPCR performance was evaluated side-by-side with qPCR and simplex ddPCR using reference material and 131 fecal and water samples. Results for fecal and water samples were highly correlated between ddPCR and simplex qPCR (coefficients~{$>~$}0.93, p~{$<~$}0.001). Duplexing Enterococcus and HF183 in qPCR led to competition and resulted in non-detection or underestimation of the target with low concentration relative to the other, while results produced by simplex and duplex ddPCR were consistent and often indistinguishable from one another. ddPCR showed greater tolerance for inhibition, with no discernable effect on quantification at inhibitor concentrations one to two orders of magnitude higher than that tolerated by qPCR. Overall, ddPCR also exhibited improved precision, higher run-to-run repeatability, similar diagnostic sensitivity and specificity on the HF183 marker, but a lower upper limit of quantification than qPCR. Digital PCR has the potential to become a reliable and economical alternative to qPCR for recreational water monitoring and fecal source identification. Findings from this study may also be of interest to other aspects of water research such as detection of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the normal temporal variation in the human microbiome is critical to developing treatments for putative microbiome-related afflictions such as obesity, Crohn’s disease, inflammatory bowel disease and malnutrition. Sequencing and computational technologies, however, have been a limiting factor in performing dense time series analysis of the human microbiome. Here, we present the largest human microbiota time series analysis to date, covering two individuals at four body sites over 396 timepoints. RESULTS: We find that despite stable differences between body sites and individuals, there is pronounced variability in an individual’s microbiota across months, weeks and even days. Additionally, only a small fraction of the total taxa found within a single body site appear to be present across all time points, suggesting that no core temporal microbiome exists at high abundance (although some microbes may be present but drop below the detection threshold). Many more taxa appear to be persistent but non-permanent community members. CONCLUSIONS: DNA sequencing and computational advances described here provide the ability to go beyond infrequent snapshots of our human-associated microbial ecology to high-resolution assessments of temporal variations over protracted periods, within and between body habitats and individuals. This capacity will allow us to define normal variation and pathologic states, and assess responses to therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Current conventional wisdom argues that human-induced excesses in nutrient loadings to estuaries often stimulate ‘excess’ algal production leading to hypoxia, via bacterial pathways, and subsequent reduced recruitment/survival of finfish and shellfish. Why wouldn't such elevated production stimulate more animal production, rather than less? In a three-year study of Long Island Sound, U.S.A., a multitude of variables were quantified along a west to east gradient, to address the above question via the hypothesis that different successes among planktonic species experiencing eutrophication alter planktonic food web structure away from traditional pathways to microbial loop dominated ones. Variables studied included: nutrient concentrations and ratios (i.e. NO2, NO3, NH4, DON, PON, PO4, Silicate, N/P and N/Si), phytoplankton, protozooplanktonic ciliate, zooplankton, heterotrophic nanoplankton (HNAN), photosynthetic nanoplankton (PNAN), size-fractionated chlorophyll, larval fish and bacterial concentrations and/or species composition, and bacterial growth rates (as frequency of dividing cells, FDC). Results indicated that although current nitrogen and other nutrient loadings into the estuary are much higher than past inputs (especially in western waters), the average concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients is similar (though slightly higher) to past values. Relative proportioning among chemical species does vary from west to east, with NH4 and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) at times more prevalent in the west, especially in bottom waters. Excess loadings of nitrogen and other nutrients into the estuary are converted to elevated biomass of both small ({$<$} 10 μm), and large ({$>$}20 μm) phytoplankton in the west. Slightly enhanced bacterial densities and growth rates shadow the elevated chlorophyll levels, with distinctive Sound-wide seasonal patterns that follow not total chlorophyll, but rather PNAN concentrations. HNAN concentrations also are elevated in the west, and likely influence bacterial dynamics. Species composition of phytoplankton routinely differ west to east. Inorganic N/P are routinely low (i.e. below Redfield ratios), especially in the west, while total dissolved N/P (i.e. including DON) are similar among stations and typically are significantly higher than Redfield ratios. Associated with bacterial and {$<$}10 μm chlorophyll enhancements to an elevated diversity of ciliate species in the west. Copepod biomass is extremely enhanced in the west, indicating that while stimulating the microbial loop, eutrophication is also enhancing the secondary production preferred by larval fish and gelatinous zooplankton. Larval fish diversity is down relative to the past, but shows little contemporaneous west/east variations. So, if adult fish populations are down, but larvae are not food limited, possibly toxicity, overfishing, and/or habitat destruction which prevent a healthy, normal system response to eutrophication are culpable. It is suggested that recipients of the excess copepod production are likely gelatinous zooplankton and benthic sediments, and that unused copepod `excess' biomass likely significantly contributes to hypoxia.},

  abstract = {Vitamin traffic, the production of organic growth factors by some microbial community members and their use by other taxa, is being scrutinized as a potential explanation for the variation and highly connected behavior observed in ocean plankton by community network analysis. Thiamin (vitamin B1), a cofactor in many essential biochemical reactions that modify carbon–carbon bonds of organic compounds, is distributed in complex patterns at subpicomolar concentrations in the marine surface layer (0–300\,m). Sequenced genomes from organisms belonging to the abundant and ubiquitous SAR11 clade of marine chemoheterotrophic bacteria contain genes coding for a complete thiamin biosynthetic pathway, except for thiC, encoding the 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (HMP) synthase, which is required for de novo synthesis of thiamin's pyrimidine moiety. Here we demonstrate that the SAR11 isolate ‘Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique', strain HTCC1062, is auxotrophic for the thiamin precursor HMP, and cannot use exogenous thiamin for growth. In culture, strain HTCC1062 required 0.7 zeptomoles per cell (ca. 400\,HMP molecules per cell). Measurements of dissolved HMP in the Sargasso Sea surface layer showed that HMP ranged from undetectable (detection limit: 2.4\,pM) to 35.7\,pM, with maximum concentrations coincident with the deep chlorophyll maximum. In culture, some marine cyanobacteria, microalgae and bacteria exuded HMP, and in the Western Sargasso Sea, HMP profiles changed between the morning and evening, suggesting a dynamic biological flux from producers to consumers.},

In this study, we employed an experimental simulation of convective overturn events to determine whether the remineralization of semilabile DOC would occur in a controlled laboratory setting. Seawater culture experiments were conducted in which surface (less than or equal to10 m) and mesopelagic (250 m) 0.2-mum filtrates were inoculated with unfiltered water from less than or equal to10 and 250 m in an assortment of combinations to simulate various mixtures of nutrients, DOC quantity and quality, and microbial assemblages. Results indicate that (1) microbial inocula from the upper euphotic zone were incapable of remineralizing the seasonally accumulated semilabile DOC (mumol C L-1 resolution) on the timescales of the incubations; (2) the utilization of semilabile DOC was greatest when the inoculum source was from 250 m and the filtrate source was from the upper 10 m; and (3) the decrease in bacterioplankton diversity, estimated with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, was greater in treatments in which inoculum from 250 m was mixed with filtrate from 10 m than in treatments in which the surface inoculum was mixed with the surface filtrate. Our findings are that a portion of the surface semilabile DOC can be metabolized by microorganisms in a laboratory setting and that mesopelagic nutrients alone are insufficient to stimulate DOC drawdown {$>$} 1.3 mumol L-1. Transformations of microbial community structure were associated with the drawdown of surface DOC in simulated mixing events and suggest that microbial community structure is a factor in surface-layer DOC dynamics.},

  abstract = {In the sunlit ocean, heterotrophic and photosynthetic microbes are prey for earth’s most abundant predators. Viruses are regulators of microbial communities, terminating phytoplankton blooms, altering biogeochemical cycles through cell lysis, and driving evolution through horizontal gene transfer. However, viral infection in the marine environment is unquantified. My research seeks understand infection in the ocean through a model marine host-virus system and through coupled studies of virus diversity and gene expression in the field. The model host were diatoms, which contribute to global biogeochemical cycles, form the base of coastal food webs, and account for approximately one fifth of global photosynthesis. The first chapter details the isolation and characterization of a novel virus that infects the toxigenic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries. The virus had the largest genome of any single stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus isolated, with a gene complement atypical for ssDNA viruses. The virus had a broad host range, infecting hosts from the distantly related centric and pennate diatom groups. The infection dynamics were host dependent, varying orders of magnitude in burst size from 220 to 9,300 viruses cell-1 and between 12-60 hours in latent period. The second chapter assesses the interactions of numerous Pseudo-nitzschia hosts and natural viral communities by isolating 41 new Pseudo-nitzschia and challenging them with 20 environmental virus samples. Pseudo-nitzschia cultures were infected in 8\% of the crosses. Viral infectivity intensified during the summer when the most permissive hosts were isolated, and viral communities were most infective of co-occurring hosts. Genotyping of the Pseudo-nitzschia cultures revealed subgroups of genetically identical hosts that were differentially infected suggesting that diatom diversity is an impediment to viral termination of diatom blooms. In the third chapter, viral infection was measured by comparing viral metagenomes to host metatranscriptomes on a coastal to open ocean transect. A small fraction of the total viral population was actively infecting. Viral groups such as the archeoviruses, virophage, and ssDNA viruses had different distributions and were differentially enriched in particle-associated and free-living metatranscriptomes. Viral expression was not correlated with virus to host ratios suggesting that microbial populations were at different stages of infection. Finally, auxiliary metabolic genes in Synechococcus phage were differentially expressed between stations despite similar community composition suggesting that auxiliary genes help viruses succeed under certain conditions. By linking culture based and cultureindependent explorations of viral ecology, this research highlights the diversity of viruses in the ocean and the lifestyles that have made them successful.},

SAR11 are dominant heterotrophs in oligotrophic systems; thus, resolving their temporal dynamics can provide important insights to the cycling of organic and inorganic nutrients. This quantitative time-series data revealed distinct annual distribution patterns of SAR11 abundance in the euphotic (0-120) and upper mesopelagic (160-300 m) zones that were reproducibly correlated with seasonal mixing and stratification of the water column. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) data generated from a decade of samples collected at BATS were combined with the FISH data to model the annual dynamics of SAR11 subclade populations. 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed to verify the correlation of the T-RFLP data with SAR11 clade structure. Clear vertical and temporal transitions were observed in the dominance of three SAR11 ecotypes. The mechanisms that lead to shifts between the different SAR11 populations are not well understood, but are probably a consequence of finely tuned physiological adaptations that partition the populations along physical and chemical gradients in the ecosystem. The correlation between evolutionary descent and temporal/spatial patterns we describe, confirmed that a minimum of three SAR11 ecotypes occupy the Sargasso Sea surface layer, and revealed new details of their population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Global trade by merchant ships is a leading mechanism for the unintentional transfer of marine organisms, including non-indigenous species, to bays and estuaries worldwide. To reduce the likelihood of new invasions, ships are increasingly being required to manage their ballast water (BW) prior to discharge in coastal waters. In the United States, most overseas arrivals have been required to manage BW discharge since 2004, primarily through ballast water exchange (BWE), which flushes out ballast tanks in the open ocean ({$>$}200 miles from shore). Studies have found BWE to generally reduce the abundance of organisms, and the amount of water exchanged has been estimated at 96–100\%. Despite its widespread use, the overall effect of this management strategy on net propagule supply through time has not been explored. Here, temporal changes in zooplankton concentrations and the volume of BW discharged in Chesapeake Bay, U.S. were evaluated, comparing pre-management era and post-management era time periods. Chesapeake Bay is a large port system that receives extensive BW discharge, especially from bulk cargo vessels (bulkers) that export coal overseas. For bulkers arriving from overseas, mean zooplankton concentrations of total and coastal indicator taxa in BW did not decline between pre- (1993–2000) and post management (2012–2013) eras, when controlling for season and sampling method. Moreover, bulkers discharged 21 million tonnes (82\% of total for Chesapeake Bay) of overseas BW in 2013, representing a 374\% increase in volume when compared to 2005. The combination of BW discharge volume and zooplankton concentration data indicates that (a) net propagule supply by bulkers has increased since BWE began in Chesapeake Bay; and (b) changes in vessel behaviour and trade have contributed strongly to this outcome. Specifically, the coal-driven increase in BW discharge volume from 2005–2013, concurrent with the onset of BWE regulations, worked to counteract intended results from BW management. A long-term analysis of bulker arrivals (1994–2013) reveals a 20-year minimum in arrival numbers in 2000, just when the implementation of BWE began. This study underscores the need to consider shifts in trade patterns, in order to advance and evaluate effective management strategies for biological invasions.},

  abstract = {Seawater samples were collected from the euphotic zone of the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda in August of 1989 and March–April of 1990. Microbial population abundances, chlorophyll concentration, particulate carbon and particulate nitrogen were measured. Calculations were performed to establish the relative and absolute importance of the various microbial assemblages. The choice of conversion factors (g C and N cell−1, or g C and N μm−3) for the microbial populations dramatically affected the estimation of “living” and “detrital” particulate material in the samples, and the relative importance of the various microbial groups. Averaged over all samples on either of the two cruises, microbial biomass constituted a greater proportion of the total particulate carbon and nitrogen during March–April (55\% and 63\%, respectively), than during August (≈24\% and 30\%, respectively) using “constrained” conversion factors that were derived. Accordingly, detrital material constituted the bulk of the particulate material during August, but was similar to the amount of microbial biomass during March–April. The bacterial assemblage constituted the largest single pool of microbial carbon (35\%) and nitrogen (45\%) in the water, and a significant fraction of the total particulate carbon (≈10–20\%) and nitrogen (≈15–30\%). Phototrophic nanoplankton (microalgae 2–20 μm in size) were second in overall biomass, and often dominated the microbial biomass in the deep chlorophyll maxima that were present during both cruises. The results temper recent assertions concerning the overwhelming importance of bacterial biomass in the oligotrophic Sargasso Sea but still support a major role for these microorganisms in the open ocean as repositories for carbon and nutrients.},

This study evaluated survival of two surrogate coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis (MHV). These viruses remained infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks. At 25°C, time required for 99\% reduction in reagent-grade water was 22 days for TGEV and 17 days for MHV. In pasteurized settled sewage, times for 99\% reduction were 9 days for TGEV and 7 days for MHV. At 4°C, there was {$<$}1log10 infectivity decrease for both viruses after four weeks. Coronaviruses can remain infectious for long periods in water and pasteurized settled sewage, suggesting contaminated water is a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated.},

One of the main factors limiting the use of shotgun metagenomics on wide scale projects is the high cost associated with the approach. We set out to determine~if it is possible to use shallow shotgun metagenomics to characterize complex biological matrices while reducing costs. We used a staggered mock community to estimate the optimal threshold for species detection. We measured the variation of several summary statistics simulating a decrease in sequencing depth by randomly subsampling a number of reads. The main statistics that were compared are diversity estimates, species abundance, and ability of reconstructing de novo the metagenome in terms of length and completeness. Our results show that diversity indices of complex prokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral communities can be accurately estimated with 500,000 reads or less, although particularly complex samples may require 1,000,000 reads. On the contrary, any task involving the reconstruction of the metagenome performed poorly, even with the largest simulated subsample (1,000,000 reads). The length of the reconstructed assembly was smaller than the length obtained with the full dataset, and the proportion of conserved genes that were identified in the meta-genome was drastically reduced compared to the full sample. Shallow shotgun metagenomics can be a useful tool to describe the structure of complex matrices, but it is not adequate to reconstruct-even partially-the metagenome.},

  abstract = {A fraction of organic carbon produced in the oceans by phytoplankton sinks storing 5–15 gigatonnes of carbon annually in the ocean interior. The accepted paradigm is that rapid aggregation of phytoplankton cells occurs, forming large, fresh particles which sink quickly; this concept is incorporated into ecosystem models used to predict the future climate. Here we demonstrate a slower, less efficient export pathway in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Lipid biomarkers suggest that the large, fast-sinking particles found beneath the mixed layer are compositionally distinct from those found in the mixed layer and thus not directly and efficiently formed from phytoplankton cells. We postulate that they are formed from the in situ aggregation of smaller, slow-sinking particles over time in the mixed layer itself. This export pathway is likely widespread where smaller phytoplankton species dominate. Its lack of representation in biogeochemical models suggests that they may be currently overestimating the ability of the oceans to store carbon if large, fast-sinking, labile particles dominate simulated particle export. Plain Language Summary The oceans are one of the largest sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide on our planet. One method by which this occurs is through the production of organic material (phytoplankton—plant-like cells) in the surface ocean, which capture atmospheric carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Eventually, the phytoplankton die and sink out of the surface ocean, transporting huge amounts of carbon to the deep ocean where it is stored for centuries or even millennia. Our current understanding is that generally, most organic material sinks quickly as large, fast-sinking (hundreds of meters per day) particles (clumps of dead phytoplankton cells). However, in our study in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, we were able to show that a different and much slower process occurs where phytoplankton first aggregate to smaller, slower sinking detrital particles and eventually form very degraded larger particles that sink to the deep. This has consequences for estimating ocean carbon storage as smaller particles are respired much quicker than larger particles. Thus, where they are an important part of this carbon sink, such as in the Equatorial Pacific, the proportion phytoplankton-captured atmospheric carbon dioxide being stored in the deep ocean is likely reduced.},

  abstract = {The efficiency of the ocean’s biological carbon pump (BCPeff – here the product of particle export and transfer efficiencies) plays a key role in the air-sea partitioning of CO2. Despite its importance in the global carbon cycle, the biological processes that control BCPeff are poorly known. We investigate the potential role that zooplankton play in the biological carbon pump using both in situ observations and model output. Observed and modelled estimates of fast, slow and total sinking fluxes are presented from three oceanic sites: the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, the temperate North Atlantic and the equatorial Pacific oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We find that observed particle export efficiency is inversely related to primary production likely due to zooplankton grazing, in direct contrast to the model estimates. The model and observations show strongest agreement in remineralization coefficients and BCPeff at the OMZ site where zooplankton processing of particles in the mesopelagic zone is thought to be low. As the model has limited representation of zooplankton-mediated remineralization processes, we suggest that these results point to the importance of zooplankton in setting BCPeff, including particle grazing and fragmentation, and the effect of diel vertical migration. We suggest that improving parameterizations of zooplankton processes may increase the fidelity of biogeochemical model estimates of the biological carbon pump. Future changes in climate such as the expansion of OMZs may decrease the role of zooplankton in the biological carbon pump globally, hence increasing its efficiency.},

  abstract = {Studies of nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in the oligotrophic surface waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean have been constrained because ambient concentrations are typically at or below the detection limits of standard colorometric methods, except during periods of deep vertical mixing. Here we report the application of high-sensitivity analytical methods-determinations of nitrate plus nitrite (N + N) by chemiluminescence and soluble reactive phosphorus (SR-P) by the magnesium induced co-precipitation (MAGIC) protocol-to surface waters along a transect from the Sargasso Sea at 26 degreesN through the Gulf Stream at 37 degreesN, including sampling at the JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) station. The results were compared with data from the BATS program, and the HOT station in the Pacific Ocean, permitting cross-ecosystem comparisons. Microbial populations were analyzed along the transect, and an attempt was made to interpret their distributions in the context of the measured nutrient concentrations. Surface concentrations of N+N and SRP during the March 1998 transect separated into 3 distinct regions, with the boundaries corresponding roughly to the locations of the BATS station (similar to 31 degreesN) and the Gulf Stream (similar to 37 degreesN). Although N+N and SRP co-varied, the [N+N]:[SR-P] molar ratios increased systematically from similar to1 to 10 in the southern segment, remained relatively constant at similar to 40-50 between 31 degreesN and 37 degreesN, then decreased again systematically to ratios {$<$} 10 north of the Gulf Stream. Dissolved organic N (DON) and P (DOP) dominated (greater than or equal to 90\%) the total dissolved N (TDN) and P (TDP) pools except in the northern portion of the transect. The [DON]: [DOP] molar ratios were relatively invariant (similar to 30-60) across the entire transect. Heterotrophic prokaryotes (operationally defined as “bacteria”), Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, ultra-and nanophytoplaakton, cryptophytes, and coccolithophores were enumerated by flow cytometry. The abundance of bacteria was well correlated with the concentration of SRP, and that of the ultra- and nanophytoplankton was well correlated with the concentration of N+N. The only group whose concentration was correlated with temperature was Prochlorococcus, and its abundance was unrelated to the concentrations of nutrients measured at the surface. We combined our transect results with time-series measurements from the BATS site and data from select depth profiles, and contrasted these North Atlantic data sets with time-series of N and P nutrient measurements from a station in the North Pacific subtropical gyre near Hawaii [Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) site]. Two prominent differences are readily observed from this comparison. The [N + N]: [SRP] molar ratios are much less than 16: 1 during stratified periods in surface waters at the BATS site, as is the case at the HOT site year round. However, following deep winter mixing, this ratio is much higher than 16, 1 at BATS. Also, SRP concentrations in the upper 100 m at BATS fall in the range 1-10 nM during stratified periods, which is at least one order of magnitude lower than at the HOT site. That two ecosystems with comparable rates of primary and export production would differ so dramatically in their nutrient dynamics is intriguing, and highlights the need for detailed cross ecosystem comparisons.

Despite its proximity to the coast, oligotrophic conditions prevailed at this station (yearly mean of Chl a = 0.43 μg dm−3, NO3 = 0.55 μmol dm−3 and PO4 = 0.04 μmol dm−3). Episodic meteorological events (dominant winds, inputs from the Rhone River) induced rapid oscillations (within 15 days) in temperature and sometimes salinity that resulted in rapid changes in phytoplankton succession and a high variability in C/P ratios within the particulate and dissolved organic matter. Throughout the year, BP ranged from 0.01 to 0.82 μg C dm−3 h−1 and bacterial growth efficiency varied from 1 to 39 \%, with higher values in summer. Enrichment experiments showed that BP was limited most of the year by phosphorus availability (except in winter). A significant positive correlation was found between in situ temperature, BP, BR and phos. Finally, we found that temperature and phosphate availability were the main factors driving heterotrophic bacterial activity and thus play a fundamental role in carbon fluxes within the marine ecosystem.},

A recurrent second FMax was observed in the ETPM, which was formed only when the upper limit of the OMZ (9.0 mu mol L-1) overlapped with the 1\% downwelling blue irradiance depth (E-d490). The presence of the second FMax increased the total integrated water column chlorophyll from 20\% to 40\%. The second FMax was absent from areas where oxygenated California Current Water (CCW) deepened the upper limit of the OMZ below 1\% E-d490. The poleward Mexican Coastal Current carried less oxygenated Subtropical Subsurface Water into the area, and enabled the formation of the second FMax.

A management strategy aimed at improving water clarity through reduction of nutrient and solids loads to the bay is under development. The strategy is informed through the use of the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Modeling Package. We describe herein aspects of the model devoted to suspended solids, a major contributor to poor water clarity. Our approach incorporates a dynamic model of inorganic solids into an eutrophication model, in order to account for interactions between physical and biotic factors which influence suspended solids transport and fate. Solids budgets based on the model indicate that internal production of organic solids is the largest source of suspended solids to the mainstem bay. Scenario analysis indicates that control of solids loads reduces solids concentration in the vicinity of the loading sources. Control of nutrient loads provides more widespread but lesser reductions in suspended solids.},

Cyanobacteria, often referred to as algae, are one of the many microorganisms capable of reaching bloom abundances. In recent years, HABs have increased in prevalence in the Chesapeake Bay due to eutrophication from nutrient and pollution runoff into the watershed. Our research focused on the mitigation of HABs, specifically blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa, a cyanobacterium that blooms annually in the upper Chesapeake and its tributaries. Our mitigation approach used sediment-flocculant mixtures to remove cyanobacteria cells from the water column. We explored the environmental impact of our efforts and the potential for indigenous grass restoration by incorporating submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) seeds into our mitigation technique. Based on our data regarding efficacy, cost, environmental safety, and public opinion, we suggest mixtures consisting of local sediments and the flocculant chitosan for use in mitigating M. aeruginosa HABs in the Chesapeake Bay.},

The vehicles are often equipped with sensors measuring temperature, conductivity, chlorophyll a fluorescence (Chl a), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence, phycoerithrin (PE) fluorescence and spectral volume scattering function at 117 degrees, providing users with high resolution, real time data. However, calibration of these instruments can be problematic. Most in situ calibrations are performed by deploying complementary instrument packages or water samplers in the proximity of the glider. Laboratory calibrations of the mounted sensors are difficult due to the placement of the instruments within the body of the vehicle. For the laboratory calibrations of the Slocum glider instruments we developed a small calibration chamber where we can perform precise calibrations of the optical instruments aboard our glider, as well as sensors from other deployment platforms. These procedures enable us to obtain pre- and post-deployment calibrations for optical fluorescence instruments, which may differ due to the biofouling and other physical damage that can occur during long-term glider deployments. We found that biofouling caused significant changes in the calibration scaling factors of fluorescent sensors, suggesting the need for consistent and repetitive calibrations for gliders as proposed in this paper.

  abstract = {The ratio of two in situ optical measurements – chlorophyll fluorescence (Chl F) and optical particulate backscattering (bbp) – varied with changes in phytoplankton community composition during the North Atlantic Bloom Experiment in the Iceland Basin in 2008. Using ship-based measurements of Chl F, bbp, chlorophyll a (Chl), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigments, phytoplankton composition and carbon biomass, we found that oscillations in the ratio varied with changes in plankton community composition; hence we refer to Chl F/bbp as an "optical community index". The index varied by more than a factor of 2, with low values associated with pico- and nanophytoplankton and high values associated with diatom-dominated phytoplankton communities. Observed changes in the optical index were driven by taxa-specific chlorophyll-to-autotrophic carbon ratios and by physiological changes in Chl F associated with the silica limitation. A Lagrangian mixed-layer float and four Seagliders, operating continuously for 2 months, made similar measurements of the optical community index and followed the evolution and later demise of the diatom spring bloom. Temporal changes in optical community index and, by implication, the transition in community composition from diatom to post-diatom bloom communities were not simultaneous over the spatial domain surveyed by the ship, float and gliders. The ratio of simple optical properties measured from autonomous platforms, when carefully validated, provides a unique tool for studying phytoplankton patchiness on extended temporal scales and ecologically relevant spatial scales and should offer new insights into the processes regulating patchiness.},

In contrast to macroscopic organisms, their environmental preferences and ecological interdependencies remain difficult to assess, requiring laborious molecular surveys at diverse sampling sites. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of previously sampled microbial lineages in the environment. We grouped publicly available 16S ribosomal RNA sequences into operational taxonomic units at various levels of resolution and systematically searched these for co-occurrence across environments. Naturally occurring microbes, indeed, exhibited numerous, significant interlineage associations. These ranged from relatively specific groupings encompassing only a few lineages, to larger assemblages of microbes with shared habitat preferences. Many of the coexisting lineages were phylogenetically closely related, but a significant number of distant associations were observed as well. The increased availability of completely sequenced genomes allowed us, for the first time, to search for genomic correlates of such ecological associations. Genomes from coexisting microbes tended to be more similar than expected by chance, both with respect to pathway content and genome size, and outliers from these trends are discussed. We hypothesize that groupings of lineages are often ancient, and that they may have significantly impacted on genome evolution.},

  abstract = {Historically, the biodiversity and composition of species in a locality was thought to be influenced primarily by deterministic factors. In such cases, species' niches create differential responses to environmental conditions and interspecific interactions, which combine to determine that locality's biodiversity and species composition. More recently, proponents of the neutral theory have placed a premium on how stochastic factors, such as birth, death, colonization, and extinction (termed “ecological drift”) influence diversity and species composition in a locality independent of their niches. Here, I develop the hypothesis that the relative importance of stochastic ecological drift and/or priority effects depend on the harshness of the ecological filter in those habitats. I established long-term experimental ponds to explore the relative importance of community assembly history and drought on patterns of community compositional similarity among ponds that were otherwise similar in their environmental conditions. I show considerable site-to-site variation in pond community composition in the absence of drought that likely resulted from a combination of stochastic ecological drift and priority effects. However, in ponds that experienced drought, I found much higher similarity among communities that likely resulted from niche-selection filtering out species from the regional pool that could not tolerate such environmental harshness. These results implicate the critical role for understanding the processes of community assembly when examining patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales.},

  abstract = {In aquatic systems, bacterial community succession is a function of top-down and bottom-up factors, but little information exists on “sideways” controls, such as bacterial predation by Bdellovibrio-like organisms (BLOs), which likely impacts nutrient cycling within the microbial loop and eventual export to higher trophic groups. Here we report transient response of estuarine microbiota and BLO spp. to tidal-associated dissolved organic matter supply in a river-dominated estuary, Apalachicola Bay, Florida. Both dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations oscillated over the course of the tidal cycle with relatively higher concentrations observed at low tide. Concurrent with the shift in dissolved organic matter (DOM) supply at low tide, a synchronous increase in numbers of bacteria and predatorial BLOs were observed. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism of small subunit rDNA, cloning, and sequence analyses revealed distinct shifts such that, at low tide, significantly higher phylotype abundances were observed from γ-Proteobacteria, δ-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria. Conversely, diversity of α-Proteobacteria, β-Proteobacteria, and Chlamydiales-Verrucomicrobia group increased at high tides. To identify metabolically active BLO guilds, tidal microcosms were spiked with six 13C-labeled bacteria as potential prey and studied using an adaptation of stable isotope probing. At low tide, representative of higher DOM and increased prey but lower salinity, BLO community also shifted such that mesohaline clusters I and VI were more active; with an increased salinity at high tide, halotolerant clusters III, V, and X were predominant. Eventually, 13C label was identified from higher micropredators, indicating that trophic interactions within the estuarine microbial food web are potentially far more complex than previously thought.},

  abstract = {I review the mathematical and biological aspects of Hubbell's (2001) neutral theory of species abundance for ecological communities, and clarify its historical connections with closely related approaches in population genetics. A selective overview of the empirical evidence for and against this theory is provided, with a special emphasis on tropical plant communities. The neutral theory predicts many of the basic patterns of biodiversity, confirming its heuristic power. The strict assumption of equivalence that defines neutrality, equivalence among individuals, finds little empirical support in general. However, a weaker assumption holds for stable communities, the equivalence of average fitness among species. One reason for the surprising success of the neutral theory is that all the theories of species coexistence satisfying the fitness equivalence assumption, including many theories of niche differentiation, generate exactly the same patterns as the neutral theory. Hubbell's neutral theory represents an important synthesis and a much needed demonstration of the pivotal role of intraspecific variability in ecology. Further improvements should lead to an explicit linking to niche-based processes. This research programme will depend crucially on forthcoming theoretical and empirical achievements.},

Here we investigated the presence of virulence factors and genetic diversity of V. parahaemolyticus isolated from water, oyster, and sediment samples from the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. Of more than 2,350 presumptive Vibrio collected, more than half were confirmed through PCR as V. parahaemolyticus, with ten encoding both tdh and trh and six encoding only trh. Potentially pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus were then serotyped with O1:KUT and O3:KUT predominant. Furthermore, PFGE was performed and the constructed dendrogram displayed high diversity, as did results from multiple-locus VNTR analysis. Vibrio parahaemolyticus was readily isolated from Chesapeake Bay waters but was less frequently isolated from oyster and sediment samples collected during this study. Potentially pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus was isolated in fewer numbers and the isolates displayed expansive diversity. Although characteristics of the pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus were highly variable and the percent of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus detected was low, it is important to note that, pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus are present in the Chesapeake Bay, warranting seafood monitoring to minimize risk of disease for the public, and to reduce the economic burden of V. parahaemolyticus related illness.},

Current RNA-Seq based normalization methods that have been adapted for microbiome data fail to consider the unique characteristics of microbiome data, which contain a vast number of zeros due to the physical absence or under-sampling of the microbes. Normalization methods that specifically address the zero-inflation remain largely undeveloped. Here we propose geometric mean of pairwise ratios—a simple but effective normalization method—for zero-inflated sequencing data such as microbiome data. Simulation studies and real datasets analyses demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust than competing methods, leading to more powerful detection of differentially abundant taxa and higher reproducibility of the relative abundances of taxa.},

In order to analyze the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 by statistical data based on the confirmed positive cases which are collected between December 31, 2019 to April 25, 2020. The present analysis reveals that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the major countries lie on the Equator is 78,509 cases, the countries lie on the Tropic of Cancer is 62,930 cases (excluding China) and the countries lie on the Tropic of Capricorn is 22,842 cases. The tropical countries, which comes between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn is reported to be 1,77,877 cases. The temperate zone countries, which are above and below the tropical countries are reported to be 25,66,171 cases so, the pandemic analysis describes the correlation between latitude, temperate zones, PM2.5 and local environmental factors. Hence, the temperature plays a pivotal role in the spreading of coronavirus at below 20~°C. The spreading of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Northern and Southern Hemispheres has inverse order against absorption of insolated energy. In temperate zone countries, the concentration of PM2.5 at below 20~μg/m3 has higher spreading rate of SARS-CoV-2 cases. The effect of insolation energy and PM2.5, it is confirmed that the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 is explained by dumb-bell model and solid/liquid interface formation mechanism. The present meta-analysis also focuses on the impact of GHSI, HDI, PD and PM2.5 on spreading of SARS-CoV-2 cases.},

Standardized methods for biodiversity assessment and monitoring are needed. Species diversity is one of the most widely adopted metrics for assessing patterns and processes of biodiversity, at both ecological and biogeographic scales. However, those perspectives differ because of the types of data that can be feasibly collected, resulting in differences in the questions that can be addressed. Despite a theoretical consensus on diversity metrics, standardized methods for its measurement are lacking, especially at the scales needed to monitor biodiversity for conservation and management purposes. We review the conceptual framework for species diversity, examine common metrics, and explore their use for biodiversity conservation and management. Key differences in diversity measures at ecological and biogeographic scales are the completeness of species lists and the ability to include information on species abundances. We analyse the major pitfalls and problems with quantitative measurement of species diversity, look at the use of weighting measures by phylogenetic distance, discuss potential solutions and propose a research agenda to solve the major existing problems.},

The principle at the basis of the method is that RNA is separated from DNA after extraction with an acidic solution containing guanidinium thiocyanate, sodium acetate, phenol and chloroform, followed by centrifugation. Under acidic conditions, total RNA remains in the upper aqueous phase, while most of DNA and proteins remain either in the interphase or in the lower organic phase. Total RNA is then recovered by precipitation with isopropanol and can be used for several applications. The original protocol, enabling the isolation of RNA from cells and tissues in less than 4 hours, greatly advanced the analysis of gene expression in plant and animal models as well as in pathological samples, as demonstrated by the overwhelming number of citations the paper gained over 20 years.},

  abstract = {Our ability to define and quantify individual microbe-microbe interactions with traditional community ecology principles is still in development yet these relationships are key to understanding microbial roles in the ocean. Application of molecular methods, such as community fingerprinting and metagenomics have added significant insight into marine viral and microbial ecology in general over the last decade. Great progress has been made in identifying what organisms or taxonomic groups are present, their abundances and their genomic context. Metagenomic and genomic studies have highlighted the phylogenetic and functional diversity of viruses in the ocean. However, aside from work on the limited number of cultured organisms, our understanding of microbe-microbe relationships is often broad and does not typically lead to systematic identification of multiple relationships from the environment at the same time. The ease and feasibility of these molecular tools are increasingly an essential part of the microbial ecologists' toolbox. Continuing research with microbial association networks can lead to a better understanding of how individual members of a diverse microbial community relate to one another and will ultimately facilitate predictions on how resilient or susceptible the microbial community may be to their future ocean climate. The microbial community at the San Pedro Ocean Time-series was characterized in great detail -- with a specific focus on viral and bacterial communities and inter-microbe relationships as part of the USC Microbial Observatory program. First, ten-years of observations of bacterial communities in the euphotic zone revealed seasonal and annual trends in the surface ocean (Chapter 2). There were only a few dissimilarities between the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) depths in terms of the microbial constituents; thus, a core euphotic zone microbiome at this location was described based on taxonomic identity and persistence of organisms. Differences between depths were not in the taxonomic composition of the bacterial communities, but rather were observed in depth-specific association networks. More specifically, it was the relative abundances and correlations between the OTUs that differed, suggesting that microbial interactions differ between depths. Second, a new molecular fingerprinting assay was developed to characterize the T4-like myovirus family -- an abundant and diverse group of viruses in the ocean (Chapter 3). Seasonal trends were also observed for this virus family over a three-year period. A persistent subset of all OTUs was also identified, some of which demonstrated seasonality while others were moderately abundant and steady year-round. Third, interrogation of individual relationships between members of viral, bacterial and protistan communities in the surface ocean by statistical and network-based analyses led to identification of individual virus-bacteria and protist-bacteria correlations (Chapter 4). In general, T4-like viruses and bacteria were more tightly coupled than protists to bacteria based on network analysis and shifts in community composition. Lastly, differences in the water column were observed by viral metagenomics and found that mesopelagic viruses differed from the upper water column (Chapter 5). Photosynthesis genes, from cyanophage most likely, were primarily seen in the euphotic zone. Siphoviruses were a larger proportion of the community below the euphotic zone. Collectively, this dissertation detailed temporal variability in microbial communities by identifying several hundred viral and bacterial OTUs over time and the underlying connections. These results will provide new insights into the individual links that sustain community-level relationships within the microbial loop and our understanding of microbial roles in the ocean.},

Bacterial communities in the euphotic zone were investigated for over a decade at the San Pedro Ocean Time-series station (SPOT) off southern California. Community composition was assessed by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) and coupled with measurements of oceanographic parameters for the surface ocean (0–5 m) and deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM, average depth \textasciitilde 30 m). SAR11 and cyanobacterial ecotypes comprised typically more than one-third of the measured community; diversity within both was temporally variable, although a few operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were consistently more abundant. Persistent OTUs, mostly Alphaproteobacteria (SAR11 clade), Actinobacteria and Flavobacteria, tended to be abundant, in contrast to many rarer yet intermittent and ephemeral OTUs. Association networks revealed potential niches for key OTUs from SAR11, cyanobacteria, SAR86 and other common clades on the basis of robust correlations. Resilience was evident by the average communities drifting only slightly as years passed. Average Bray-Curtis similarity between any pair of dates was \textasciitilde 40\%, with a slight decrease over the decade and obvious near-surface seasonality; communities 8–10 years apart were slightly more different than those 1–4 years apart with the highest rate of change at 0–5 m between communities {$<$}4 years apart. The surface exhibited more pronounced seasonality than the DCM. Inter-depth Bray-Curtis similarities repeatedly decreased as the water column stratified each summer. Environmental factors were better predictors of shifts in community composition than months or elapsed time alone; yet, the best predictor was community composition at the other depth (that is, 0–5 m versus DCM).},

We evaluated these relationships through microbial association network analysis of samples collected approximately monthly from March 2008 to January 2011 in the surface ocean (0-5\,m) at the San Pedro Ocean Time series station. Bacterial, T4-like myoviral and protistan communities were described by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of the gene encoding the major capsid protein (g23) and 18S ribosomal DNA, respectively. Concurrent shifts in community structure suggested similar timing of responses to environmental and biological parameters. We linked T4-like myoviral, bacterial and protistan operational taxonomic units by local similarity correlations, which were then visualized as association networks. Network links (correlations) potentially represent synergistic and antagonistic relationships such as viral lysis, grazing, competition or other interactions. We found that virus-bacteria relationships were more cross-linked than protist-bacteria relationships, suggestive of increased taxonomic specificity in virus-bacteria relationships. We also found that 80\% of bacterial-protist and 74\% of bacterial-viral correlations were positive, with the latter suggesting that at monthly and seasonal timescales, viruses may be following their hosts more often than controlling host abundance.},

For example, Synechococcus is restricted to the first 100 m, whereas Prochlorococcus extends much deeper in oligotrophic waters. This is in part explained by differences in adaptation to nutrient and light regimes. However, they could also be subjected to different predation rates. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the consumption of these two picoplankters by an algivorous ciliate, Strombidium sulcatum, and a bactivorous ciliate. Uronema sp. For both ciliate species, removal rates were higher by a factor of 3 to 10, for Synechococcus compared to Prochlorococcus when prey items were presented alone or together. The growth of the two ciliates fed Synechococcus and/or Prochlorococcus also differed. S. sulcatum grew well on both prey items, whether alone or together, whereas Uronema sp. grew slowly when fed Synechococcus and very poorly when fed Prochlorococcus either alone or with Synechococcus. Our results suggest that Prochlorococcus may be less subject to ciliate predation than Synechococcus.},

  abstract = {Ammonia oxidation, the first step in nitrification, is performed by certain Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria and Crenarchaea to generate metabolic energy. Ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes from both Bacteria and Crenarchaea have been found in a variety of marine ecosystems, but the relative importance of Bacteria versus Crenarchaea in ammonia oxidation is unresolved, and seasonal comparisons are rare. In this study, we compared the abundance of betaproteobacterial and crenarchaeal amoA genes in the coastal Arctic Ocean during summer and winter over 2 years. Summer and winter betaproteobacterial amoA clone libraries were significantly different, although the gene sequences were similar to those found in temperate and polar environments. Betaproteobacterial and crenarchaeal amoA genes were 30- to 115-fold more abundant during the winter than during the summer in both years of the study. Archaeal amoA genes were more abundant than betaproteobacterial amoA genes in the first year, but betaproteobacterial amoA was more abundant than archaeal amoA the following year. The ratio of archaeal amoA gene copies to marine group I crenarchaeal 16S rRNA genes averaged 2.9 over both seasons and years, suggesting that ammonia oxidation was common in Crenarchaea at this location. Potential nitrification rates, as well as the total amoA gene abundance, were highest in the winter when competition with phytoplankton was minimal and ammonium concentrations were the highest. These results suggest that ammonium concentrations were important in determining the rates of ammonia oxidation and the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing Betaproteobacteria and Crenarchaea.},

However, ligands for PRRs are not exclusive to pathogens, and are abundantly produced by the resident microbiota during normal colonization. Mechanism(s) that underlie this paradox have remained unclear. Recent studies reveal that gut bacterial ligands from the microbiota signal through PRRs to promote host tissue and immune development, and protection from disease. Furthermore, evidence from both invertebrate and vertebrate models reveals that innate immune receptors are required to promote long-term colonization by the microbiota. This emerging perspective challenges current paradigms in immunology, and suggests that PRRs may have evolved, in part, to mediate the bidirectional crosstalk between microbial symbionts and their hosts.},

  abstract = {Ocean time-series provide vital information needed for assessing ecosystem change. This paper summarizes the historical context, major program objectives, and future research priorities for three contemporary ocean time-series programs: The Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT), the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS), and the CARIACO Ocean Time-Series. These three programs operate in physically and biogeochemically distinct regions of the world's oceans, with HOT and BATS located in the open-ocean waters of the subtropical North Pacific and North Atlantic, respectively, and CARIACO situated in the anoxic Cariaco Basin of the tropical Atlantic. All three programs sustain near-monthly shipboard occupations of their field sampling sites, with HOT and BATS beginning in 1988, and CARIACO initiated in 1996. The resulting data provide some of the only multi-disciplinary, decadal-scale determinations of time-varying ecosystem change in the global ocean. Facilitated by a scoping workshop (September 2010) sponsored by the Ocean Carbon Biogeochemistry (OCB) program, leaders of these time-series programs sought community input on existing program strengths and for future research directions. Themes that emerged from these discussions included: 1. Shipboard time-series programs are key to informing our understanding of the connectivity between changes in ocean-climate and biogeochemistry. 2. The scientific and logistical support provided by shipboard time-series programs forms the backbone for numerous research and education programs. Future studies should be encouraged that seek mechanistic understanding of ecological interactions underlying the biogeochemical dynamics at these sites. 3. Detecting time-varying trends in ocean properties and processes requires consistent, high-quality measurements. Time-series must carefully document analytical procedures and, where possible, trace the accuracy of analyses to certified standards and internal reference materials. 4. Leveraged implementation, testing, and validation of autonomous and remote observing technologies at time-series sites provide new insights into spatiotemporal variability underlying ecosystem changes. 5. The value of existing time-series data for formulating and validating ecosystem models should be promoted. In summary, the scientific underpinnings of ocean time-series programs remain as strong and important today as when these programs were initiated. The emerging data inform our knowledge of the ocean's biogeochemistry and ecology, and improve our predictive capacity about planetary change.},

Here we review Europa's suitability for life from the perspective of these three requirements. It is likely, though not yet certain, that Europa harbors a subsurface ocean of liquid water whose volume is about twice that of Earth's oceans. Little is known about Europa's inventory of carbon, nitrogen, and other biogenic elements, but lower bounds on these can be placed by considering the role of cometary delivery over Europa's history. Sources of free energy are challenging for a world covered with an ice layer kilometers thick, but it is possible that hydrothermal activity and/or organics and oxidants provided by the action of radiation chemistry at Europa's surface and subsequent mixing into Europa's ocean could provide the electron donors and acceptors needed to power a Europan ecosystem. It is not premature to draw lessons from the search for life on Mars with the Viking spacecraft for planning exobiological missions to Europa.},

The estimated MVBS exhibited distinct patterns of DVM at all three mooring sites. Between February and October, the timing of the DVM and the residence time of zooplankton at depth were clearly governed by the day–night rhythm. Mean daily cycles of the ADCP-derived vertical velocity were calculated for successive months and showed maximum ascent and descent velocities of 16 and –15 mm sÀ1. However, a change of the MVBS pattern occurred in late spring/early austral summer (October/ November), when the zooplankton communities ceased their synchronous vertical migration at all three mooring sites. Elevated MVBS values were then concentrated in the uppermost layers ( o 50 m) at 66.51S. This period coincided with the decay of sea ice coverage at 641S and 66.51S between early November and mid-December. Elevated chlorophyll concentrations, which were measured at the end of the deployment, extended from 671S to 651S and indicated a phytoplankton bloom in the upper 50 m. Thus, we propose that the increased food supply associated with an ice edge bloom caused the zooplankton communities to cease their DVM in favour of feeding.},

  abstract = {Advances in computational statistics provide a general framework for the highdimensional models typically needed for ecological inference and prediction. Hierarchical Bayes (HB) represents a modelling structure with capacity to exploit diverse sources of information, to accommodate influences that are unknown (or unknowable), and to draw inference on large numbers of latent variables and parameters that describe complex relationships. Here I summarize the structure of HB and provide examples for common spatiotemporal problems. The flexible framework means that parameters, variables and latent variables can represent broader classes of model elements than are treated in traditional models. Inference and prediction depend on two types of stochasticity, including (1) uncertainty, which describes our knowledge of fixed quantities, it applies to all ÔunobservablesÕ (latent variables and parameters), and it declines asymptotically with sample size, and (2) variability, which applies to fluctuations that are not explained by deterministic processes and does not decline asymptotically with sample size. Examples demonstrate how different sources of stochasticity impact inference and prediction and how allowance for stochastic influences can guide research.},

With a combination of flow cytometry, microscopy and high-pressure liquid chromatography pigment analysis, we characterized the phytoplankton community structure across the front. The observed phytoplankton community fell into two distinct assemblages, largely separated by the front, but which also reflected patterns in the distribution of Kuroshio and Oyashio water masses shaped by mesoscale lateral mixing. Phytoplankton biomass was elevated where there was a positive vertical flux of nitrate towards the surface, and the frontal circulation drove a lateral transport of nutrients southwards into the subtropical gyre. The observations showed that the phytoplankton respond to forcing on several scales: the phytoplankton community across the front was shaped by a combination of the large scale biogeography of the region, mesoscale mixing of populations and finer scale modification of the light and nutrient environment.},

His original data on measles outbreaks on 19 islands over the 15 year period from 1949 to 1964 are reanalysed, and the confounding effects of island accessibility and population density upon estimates of the population threshold for measles endemicity are illustrated. Using later data, we extend Black’s analysis into the post-l\%5 measles vaccination era both for the islands he studied and for 22 others, and then explore the potential of intra-island comparisons. Although Black confined himself to measles, this paper suggests that his ideas are extendable to a wide range of other infectious dies. Island epidemiology has implications both for practical questions of disease control and for academic questions of the persistence and origin of diseases.},

  abstract = {Anomalies in the behaviour of calcium carbonate in natural solutions diminish when considered in context. Best values found by traditional oceanographie methods for the apparent solubility product constant K'CaCO3 in sea water at atmospheric pressure are consistent mineralogically—at 36 parts per thousand salinity and T-25°C, K'aragonlte is estimated as 1.12 × 10−6 and K'calcite as 0.61 × 10−6. At 30°C the corresponding values are 0.98 × 10−6 for aragonite and 0.53 × 10−6 for calcite. Because the K' computations do not compensate for ionic activity, however, they cannot give thermodynamically satisfactory results. It is of interest, therefore, that approximate methods and information now available permit the estimation from the same basic data of an activity product constant KCaCO3 close to that found in solutions to which Debye-Hückel theory applies. Such methods indicate approximate Karagonite 7.8 × 10−9 for surface sea water at 29°C; Kcalcite would be proportionately lower. Field data and experimental results indicate that the mineralogy of precipitated CaCO3 depends primarily on degree of supersaturation, thus also on kinetic or biologic factors that facilitate or inhibit a high degree of supersaturation. The shallow, generally hypersaline bank waters west of Andros Island yield aragonitic sediments with O18O16 ratios that imply precipitation mainly during the warmer months, when the combination of a high rate of evaporation, increasing salinity (and ionic strength), maximal temperatures and photosynthetic removal of CO2 result in high apparent supersaturation. The usual precipitate from solutions of low ionic strength is calcite, except where the aragonite level of supersaturation is reached as a result of diffusion phenomena (e.g. dripstones), gradual and marked evaporation, or biologic intervention. Published data also suggest the possibility of distinct chemical milieus for crystallographic variations in skeletal calcium carbonate. It appears that in nature aragonite precipitates from solutions that are supersaturated with respect to both calcite and aragonite and calcite between saturation levels for the two species. Such a relation is consistent with Ostwald's rule of successive reactions. Aragonitc of marine origin persists in contact with supersaturated interstitial solutions at ordinary temperature and pressure. Conversion to calcite follows transfer to solutions undersaturated with respect to aragonite or upon exposure to the moist atmosphere.},

Under optimized PCR conditions, both viral DNA as well as plant (jute and mesta) genomic DNA were amplified from the lysate. dPCR required fewer reagents and less incubation time reducing both time and cost of detection. Significance and Impact of the Study Identification of begomoviruses by serology is not suitable due to difficulty in preparing high titre and specific antisera. Begomoviruses are routinely detected by PCR-based techniques using universal or specific primers. However, it is a prerequisite to isolate pure DNA from the samples before PCR. DNA extraction from some plants such as jute, mesta is very difficult due to the presence of mucilage and other impurities. Therefore, we have developed a method of direct PCR without DNA extraction for detection of begomoviruses from these crops. It is the first report of a direct PCR method in jute and mesta.},

  abstract = {Ruminant livestock systems contribute significantly to emission of methane, a potent greenhouse gas as they waste a portion of the ingested energy (2–15\%) as methane and a large proportion (75–95\%) of the ingested nitrogen as ammonia. Recently, numerous researches have been conducted to evaluate plant secondary metabolites, including essential oils (EO), as natural feed additives in ruminant nutrition and to exploit their potential to improve rumen fermentation efficiency. Essential oils appeared to be very promising compounds as they selectively reduced methane production and protein breakdown in both in vitro and in vivo studies. However, in some studies, the use of EO as feed additives was accompanied with decreased feed degradability and lowered volatile fatty acid. These adverse effects could be attributed to their broad and often non-specific antimicrobial activities within the rumen. Future research should be directed to identification of the active and useful EO compounds, optimization of EO doses, and use of a whole-farm approach with a focus on animal welfare, performance and economic benefits.},

This study examined the presence and proportions of the different subgroups of F+ coliphages in a variety of fecal wastes and surface waters with well-defined potential waste impacts. Municipal wastewater samples had high proportions of F+ DNA and group II and III F+ RNA coliphages. Bovine wastewaters also contained a high proportion of F+ DNA coliphages, but group I and IV F+ RNA coliphages predominated. Swine wastewaters contained approximately equal proportions of F+ DNA and RNA coliphages, and group I and III F+ RNA coliphages were most common. Waterfowl (gull and goose) feces contained almost exclusively F+ RNA coliphages of groups I and IV. No F+ coliphages were isolated from the feces of the other species examined. F+ coliphage recovery from surface waters was influenced by precipitation events and animal or human land use. There were no significant differences in coliphage density among land use categories. Significant seasonal variation was observed in the proportions of F+ DNA and RNA coliphages. Group I F+ RNA coliphages were the vast majority (90\%) of those recovered from surface waters. The percentage of group I F+ RNA coliphages detected was greatest at background sites, and the percentage of group II F+ RNA coliphages was highest at human-impacted sites. Monitoring of F+ coliphage groups can indicate the presence and major sources of microbial inputs to surface waters, but environmental effects on the relative occurrence of different groups need to be considered.},

Here using a 1/6° HYCOM model and data from three research cruises in May–June 2010, September–October 2011, and July 2012, we investigate the pathways and properties of the plume. Four plume pathways for export of freshwater from the western tropical North Atlantic are identified. These consist of direct and indirect pathways to the northwest, and eastward pathways toward the subtropical gyre and toward Africa in the North Equatorial Counter Current. Because of the seasonality and cooccurrence of these pathways, plume characteristics are highly variable. Two pathways export water to the Caribbean, however the time scales associated with those direct and indirect pathways (3 versus 6+ months) differ, leading to different salinity characteristics of the plume water. Models results show that the Amazon river and tropical precipitation have similar magnitude impact on the observed seasonal cycle of freshwater within the western tropical Atlantic and at the 8°N, 38°W PIRATA mooring. Freshwater associated with the Amazon also influences surface salinity in winter as far as 20W in the model. The mean plume salinity minimum leads maximum discharge, highlighting the importance of currents and advection rather than discharge in maintaining plume properties. Plume pathways are tied to the underlying current structure, with the North Equatorial Counter Current jet preventing direct freshwater transport into the southern hemisphere. The plume influences underlying currents as well, generating vertical current shear that leads to enhanced eddy stirring and mixing in the model simulations.},

  abstract = {The direct respiration of sinking organic matter by attached bacteria is often invoked as the dominant sink for settling particles in the mesopelagic ocean. However, other processes, such as enzymatic solubilization and mechanical disaggregation, also contribute to particle flux attenuation by transferring organic matter to the water column. Here we use observations from the North Atlantic Ocean, coupled to sensitivity analyses of a simple model, to assess the relative importance of particle-attached microbial respiration compared to the other processes that can degrade sinking particles. The observed carbon fluxes, bacterial production rates, and respiration by water column and particle-attached microbial communities each spanned more than an order of magnitude. Rates of substrate-specific respiration on sinking particle material ranged from 0.007 ± 0.003 to 0.173 ± 0.105 dayÀ1. A comparison of these substrate-specific respiration rates with model results suggested sinking particle material was transferred to the water column by various biological and mechanical processes nearly 3.5 times as fast as it was directly respired. This finding, coupled with strong metabolic demand imposed by measurements of water column respiration (729.3 ± 266.0 mg C mÀ2 dÀ1, on average, over the 50 to 150 m depth interval), suggested a large fraction of the organic matter evolved from sinking particles ultimately met its fate through subsequent remineralization in the water column. At three sites, we also measured very low bacterial growth efficiencies and large discrepancies between depth-integrated mesopelagic respiration and carbon inputs.},

  abstract = {Jellyfish blooms occur in many estuarine and coastal regions and may be increasing in their magnitude and extent worldwide. Voracious jellyfish predation impacts food webs by converting large quantities of carbon (C), fixed by primary producers and consumed by secondary producers, into gelatinous biomass, which restricts C transfer to higher trophic levels because jellyfish are not readily consumed by other predators. In addition, jellyfish release colloidal and dissolved organic matter (jelly-DOM), and could further influence the functioning of coastal systems by altering microbial nutrient and DOM pathways, yet the links between jellyfish and bacterioplankton metabolism and community structure are unknown. Here we report that jellyfish released substantial quantities of extremely labile C-rich DOM, relative to nitrogen (25.6 ± 31.6 C:1N), which was quickly metabolized by bacterioplankton at uptake rates two to six times that of bulk DOM pools. When jelly-DOM was consumed it was shunted toward bacterial respiration rather than production, significantly reducing bacterial growth efficiencies by 10\% to 15\%. Jelly-DOM also favored the rapid growth and dominance of specific bacterial phylogenetic groups (primarily γ-proteobacteria) that were rare in ambient waters, implying that jelly-DOM was channeled through a small component of the in situ microbial assemblage and thus induced large changes in community composition. Our findings suggest major shifts in microbial structure and function associated with jellyfish blooms, and a large detour of C toward bacterial CO2 production and away from higher trophic levels. These results further suggest fundamental transformations in the biogeochemical functioning and biological structure of food webs associated with jellyfish blooms.},

Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81–99\% of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome.},

  abstract = {Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, is a naturally occurring inhabitant of the Chesapeake Bay and serves as a predictor for other clinically important vibrios, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus. A system was constructed to predict the likelihood of the presence of V. cholerae in surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay, with the goal to provide forecasts of the occurrence of this and related pathogenic Vibrio spp. Prediction was achieved by driving an available multivariate empirical habitat model estimating the probability of V. cholerae within a range of temperatures and salinities in the Bay, with hydrodynamically generated predictions of ambient temperature and salinity. The experimental predictions provided both an improved understanding of the in situ variability of V. cholerae, including identification of potential hotspots of occurrence, and usefulness as an early warning system. With further development of the system, prediction of the probability of the occurrence of related pathogenic vibrios in the Chesapeake Bay, notably V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus, will be possible, as well as its transport to any geographical location where sufficient relevant data are available.},

  abstract = {In most environments, microbial interactions take place within microscale cell aggregates. At the scale of these aggregates (∼100μm), interactions are likely to be the dominant driver of population structure and dynamics. In particular, organisms that exploit interspecific interactions to increase ecological performance often co-aggregate. Conversely, organisms that antagonize each other will tend to spatially segregate, creating distinct micro-communities and increased diversity at larger length scales. We argue that, in order to understand the role that biological interactions play in microbial community function, it is necessary to study microscale spatial organization with enough throughput to measure statistical associations between taxa and possible alternative community states. We conclude by proposing strategies to tackle this challenge.},

Pore water NH4 + concentrations below 0.5-m sediment depth averaged 5 ± 2 mmol L−1 with average adsorbed NH4 + concentrations of 11 μmol g−1. Elevated NH4 + concentrations found in rapidly accreting dredge channels are partly a result of the rapid advective burial of both reactive organic matter and pore water. Elutriate tests, a dilution of sediment with site water, yielded adsorbed NH4 + concentrations very similar to those using the more typical KCl extraction. Intact deep sediment sections exposed to overlying water, used to simulate postdredging conditions, showed high initial fluxes of ammonium and no development of coupled nitrification–denitrification under the cold incubation conditions. Despite high concentrations and effluxes of NH4 + during dredging, the amount of NH4 + release during dredging was {$<$}0.5\% of northern Chesapeake Bay sediment fluxes. The likelihood of large environmental effects of nitrogen release during the dredging of navigational channels in the Chesapeake Bay is low.},

Observations of N2 efflux in estuarine sediments across the salinity gradient of the tidal Potomac River, a eutrophic subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay, were used to evaluate environmental controls of microbial denitrification. Rates of denitrification were measured using N2:Ar ratios in core incubations and were similar to other nitrogen-enriched estuaries, with summer and spring N2-N efflux rates averaging 54 ± 47 and 153 ± 97 μmol m−2 h−1, respectively. The paradigm of higher denitrification rates at lower salinities was not supported by observations during summer and spring conditions along this estuarine salinity gradient. Low bottom water oxygen concentrations in the lower, more saline part of the estuary resulted in low rates of coupled nitrification/denitrification. The most favorable region for denitrification in the tidal Potomac River occurred where changes in salinity were most rapid and oxygen concentrations were not depleted, with high rates observed within the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) zone. Overall, the key role of salinity in the tidal Potomac River in controlling denitrification appears to be in the focusing of materials into ETM and providing stratification in the lower estuary that restricts the vertical exchange of oxygen necessary for coupled nitrification/denitrification.},

Despite intense bloom conditions in the mesocosm (chlorophyll a concentrations exceeding 165 mg/l and c exceeding 9 m-1), most optical parameters covaried linearly with biochemical parameters. There were significant positive correlations for dry mass versus the particle attenuation coefficient (cp) at 660 nm, particulate organic carbon versus the computed particle scattering coefficient (bp) at 660 nm, and chlorophyll a versus the measured particulate absorption coefficient (ap) at 660 nm, and chlorophyll a versus the measured absorption coefficient for phytoplankton (a.) at 673 run. Multiple-component model simulations of optical and biochemical measurements accurately predicted particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and chlorophyll a concentrations using cp and ap measurements. Similar equations for cp and ap estimates using the biochemical measurements are also presented.

  abstract = {Although prokaryotes are small in size, they are a significant biomass component in aquatic planktonic ecosystems and play a major role in biogeochemical processes. A review of the recent literature shows that the relative importance of prokaryotes to material and energy fluxes is maximized in low-productivity (oligotrophic) ecosystems and decreases in high-productivity (eutrophic) ecosystems. We conclude that competition with eukaryotic autotrophs for dissolved nutrients and competition with phagotrophic heterotrophs and physical processes (sinking, photooxidation) for organic carbon (C) play important roles in determining the relative abundance and impact of prokaryotes in aquatic systems. Oligotrophic systems have low nutrient concentrations, with high proportions of dissolved nutrients in organic form, which favors prokaryotic heterotrophs over phytoplankton. Furthermore, a high proportion of the available organic C is dissolved rather than particulate, which favors prokaryotic heterotrophs over phagotrophic heterotrophs. In eutrophic systems, increased relative concentrations and loading of inorganic nutrients and increased relative concentrations of particulate organic C select for phytoplankton and phagotrophic heterotrophs over prokaryotic heterotrophs. Increased particle sinking fluxes and/or decreased excretion of organic carbon (EOC) may also decrease the relative importance of prokaryotic heterotrophs in eutrophic systems. In oligotrophic systems, interactions between autotrophs and heterotrophs are tightly coupled because the dominant heterotrophs are similar in size and growth rates, as well as having similar nutrient composition to the dominant autotrophs, small phytoplankton. In eutrophic systems, increased productivity passes through zooplankton that are larger and have slower growth rates than the autotrophs, leading to a greater potential for decoupled auto- and heterotrophic production and increased export production.},

  abstract = {Sensitive and quantitative detection of foodborne enteric viruses is classically achieved by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). Recently, digital PCR (dPCR) was described as a novel approach to genome quantification without need for a standard curve. The performance of microfluidic digital RT-PCR (RT-dPCR) was compared to RT-qPCR for detecting the main viruses responsible for foodborne outbreaks (human Noroviruses (NoV) and Hepatitis A virus (HAV)) in spiked lettuce and bottled water. Two process controls (Mengovirus and Murine Norovirus) were used and external amplification controls (EAC) were added to examine inhibition of RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR. For detecting viral RNA and cDNA, the sensitivity of the RT-dPCR assays was either comparable to that of RT-qPCR (RNA of HAV, NoV GI, Mengovirus) or slightly (around 1 log10) decreased (NoV GII and MNV-1 RNA and of HAV, NoV GI, NoV GII cDNA). The number of genomic copies determined by dPCR was always from 0.4 to 1.7 log10 lower than the expected numbers of copies calculated by using the standard qPCR curve. Viral recoveries calculated by RT-dPCR were found to be significantly higher than by RT-qPCR for NoV GI, HAV and Mengovirus in water, and for NoV GII and HAV in lettuce samples. The RT-dPCR assay proved to be more tolerant to inhibitory substances present in lettuce samples. This absolute quantitation approach may be useful to standardize quantification of enteric viruses in bottled water and lettuce samples and may be extended to quantifying other human pathogens in food samples.},

Recent experimental work is beginning to unpick essential functions that can be attributed to the stable microbiota of humans. To be able to manipulate the microbiome to improve health, we need to understand community structure and composition and we need models to quantify and predict stability. Coyte et al. applied concepts and tools from community ecology to gut microbiome assembly. Independently developed models converged on a surprising answer: A high diversity of species is likely to coexist stably when the system is dominated by competitive, rather than cooperative, interactions. Science, this issue p. 663 The human gut harbors a large and complex community of beneficial microbes that remain stable over long periods. This stability is considered critical for good health but is poorly understood. Here we develop a body of ecological theory to help us understand microbiome stability. Although cooperating networks of microbes can be efficient, we find that they are often unstable. Counterintuitively, this finding indicates that hosts can benefit from microbial competition when this competition dampens cooperative networks and increases stability. More generally, stability is promoted by limiting positive feedbacks and weakening ecological interactions. We have analyzed host mechanisms for maintaining stability—including immune suppression, spatial structuring, and feeding of community members—and support our key predictions with recent data. Diversity and competition are more likely than cooperation to lead to gut microbial community stability.

  abstract = {Interactions among microbes and stratification across depths are both believed to be important drivers of microbial communities, though little is known about how microbial associations differ between and across depths. We have monitored the free-living microbial community at the San Pedro Ocean Time-series station, monthly, for a decade, at five different depths: 5 m, the deep chlorophyll maximum layer, 150 m, 500 m and 890 m (just above the sea floor). Here, we introduce microbial association networks that combine data from multiple ocean depths to investigate both within- and between-depth relationships, sometimes time-lagged, among microbes and environmental parameters. The euphotic zone, deep chlorophyll maximum and 890 m depth each contain two negatively correlated ‘modules’ (groups of many inter-correlated bacteria and environmental conditions) suggesting regular transitions between two contrasting environmental states. Two-thirds of pairwise correlations of bacterial taxa between depths lagged such that changes in the abundance of deeper organisms followed changes in shallower organisms. Taken in conjunction with previous observations of seasonality at 890 m, these trends suggest that planktonic microbial communities throughout the water column are linked to environmental conditions and/or microbial communities in overlying waters. Poorly understood groups including Marine Group A, Nitrospina and AEGEAN-169 clades contained taxa that showed diverse association patterns, suggesting these groups contain multiple ecological species, each shaped by different factors, which we have started to delineate. These observations build upon previous work at this location, lending further credence to the hypothesis that sinking particles and vertically migrating animals transport materials that significantly shape the time-varying patterns of microbial community composition.},

  abstract = {Antibodies that recognize commensal microbial antigens may be cross reactive with a part of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope glycoprotein gp41. To improve understanding of the role of the microbiota in modulating the immune response to HIV vaccines, we studied the associations of the gut microbiota composition of participants in the HIV Vaccine Trials Network 096 clinical trial with their HIV-specific immune responses in response to vaccination with a DNA-prime, pox virus boost strategy designed to recapitulate the only efficacious HIV-vaccine trial (RV144). We observed that both levels of IgG antibodies to gp41 at baseline and post-vaccination levels of IgG antibodies to the Con.6.gp120.B, ZM96.gp140 and gp70 B.CaseA V1-V2 antigens were associated with three co-occurring clusters of family level microbial taxa. One cluster contained several families positively associated with gp41-specific IgG and negatively associated with vaccine-matched gp120, gp140 and V1-V2-specific IgG responses. A second cluster contained families that negatively associated with gp41 and positively associated with gp120, gp140 and V1-V2-specific IgG responses. A third cluster contained microbial groups that did not correlate with any immune responses. Baseline and post-vaccination levels of gp41 IgG were not significantly correlated, suggesting that factors beyond the microbiome that contribute to immune response heterogeneity. Sequence variant richness was positively associated with gp41, p24, pg140 and V1-V2 specific IgG responses, gp41 and p24 IgA responses, and CD4+ T cell responses to HIV-1 proteins. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that the gut microbiota may be an important predictor of vaccine response.},

  abstract = {Marine microbes make up a key part of ocean food webs and drive ocean chemistry through a range of metabolic processes. A fundamental question in ecology is whether the diversity of organisms in a community shapes the ecological functions of that community. While there is substantial evidence to support a positive link between diversity and ecological productivity for macro-organisms in terrestrial environments, this relationship has not previously been verified for marine microbial communities. One factor complicating the understanding of this relationship is that many marine microbes are dormant and are easily dispersed by ocean currents, making it difficult to ensure that the organisms found in a given environmental sample accurately reflect processes occurring in that environment. Another complication is that, due to microbes great range of genotypic and phenotypic variability, communities with distantly related species may have greater range of metabolic functions than communities have the same richness and evenness, but in which the species present are more closely related to each other. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Galand et~al. (2015) provide compelling evidence that the most metabolically active communities are those in which the nondormant portion of the microbial community has the highest phylogenetic diversity. They also illustrate that focusing on the active portion of the community allows for detection of temporal patterns in community structure that would not be otherwise evident. The authors’ point out that the presence of many dormant organisms that do not contribute to ecosystem functioning is a feature that makes microbial ecosystems fundamentally different from macro-ecosystems and that this difference needs to be accounted for in microbial ecology theory.},

  abstract = {The “transfer efficiency” of organic particles from the surface to depth is a critical determinant of ocean carbon sequestration. Recently, direct observations and geochemical analyses have revealed a systematic geographical pattern of transfer efficiency, which is highest in high latitude regions and lowest in the subtropical gyres. We evaluate the possible causes of this pattern using a mechanistic model of sinking particle dynamics. The model represents the size distribution of particles, the effects of mineral ballast, seawater temperature (which influences both particle settling velocity and microbial metabolic rates), and O2. Parameters are optimized within reasonable ranges to best match the observational constraints. Our model shows that no single factor can explain the observed pattern of transfer efficiency, but the biological effect of temperature on remineralization rate and particle size effects together can reproduce most of the regional variability with both factors contributing to low transfer efficiency in the subtropical gyres and high transfer efficiency in high latitudes. Particle density from mineral ballast has a similar directional effect to temperature and size but plays a substantially smaller role in our optimum solution, due to the opposing patterns of silicate and calcium carbonate ballasting. Oxygen effects modestly improved model fit by depressing remineralization rates and thus increasing transfer efficiency in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Our model implies that climate-driven changes to upper ocean temperature and associated changes in surface plankton size distribution would reduce the carbon sequestration efficiency in a warmer ocean.},

We combined diel and spatial sampling of ammonium concentrations throughout the water column with measurements of ammonium production from sinking particles that were collected and incubated on particle-collector/incubators traps. We observed that while ammonium concentrations were usually evident at concentrations up to one micro-molar below the primary chlorophyll maximum in the upper oxycline above the oxygen minimum zone, they were undetectable within the core of the oxygen minimum zone throughout the incubation. Particles, however did produce ammonium throughout the oxygen minimum zone. The production of ammonium by particles but its absence throughout the oxygen minimum zone suggests that it is removed efficiently by microorganisms in the low oxygen water column, presumably either through anammox or assimilation processes. We also hypothesized that migrating swarms of zooplankton and micronekton, observed via acoustics, would correspond with diel increases in ammonium concentration, as those organisms are known to produce ammonium. We did not see such a signal, again suggesting that any ammonium produced by these organisms is quickly removed in the water column.},

Bacterial community composition was characterized with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal DNA. Average community doubling time was calculated from bacterial production ([14C]leucine incorporation) and bacterial abundance (direct counts). Freshwater and marine populations advected into the estuary represented a large fraction of the bacterioplankton community in all seasons. However, a unique estuarine community formed at intermediate salinities in summer and fall, when average doubling time was much shorter than water residence time, but not in spring, when doubling time was similar to residence time. Sequencing of DNA in DGGE bands demonstrated that most bands represented single phylotypes and that matching bands from different samples represented identical phylotypes. Most river and coastal ocean bacterioplankton were members of common freshwater and marine phylogenetic clusters within the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. Estuarine bacterioplankton also belonged to these phyla but were related to clones and isolates from several different environments, including marine water columns, freshwater sediments, and soil.},

Pyrosequencing of small subunit ribosomal RNA gene hypervariable regions to characterize microbial communities along a hydrological continuum in arctic tundra showed a pattern of decreasing diversity downslope, with highest species richness in soil waters and headwater streams, and lowest richness in lake water. In a downstream lake, 58\% and 43\% of the bacterial and archaeal taxa, respectively, were also detected in diverse upslope communities, including most of the numerically dominant lake taxa. In contrast, only 18\% of microbial eukaryotic taxa in the lake were detected upslope. We suggest that patterns of diversity in surface waters are structured by initial inoculation from microbial reservoirs in soils followed by a species-sorting process during downslope dispersal of both common and rare microbial taxa. Our results suggest that, unlike for metazoans, a substantial portion of bacterial and archaeal diversity in surface freshwaters may originate in complex soil environments.},

  abstract = {The Columbia River estuary is a dynamic system in which estuarine turbidity maxims trap and extend the residence time of particles and particle-attached bacteria over those of the water and free-living bacteria. Particle-attached bacteria dominate bacterial activity in the estuary and are an important part of the estuarine food web. PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes from particle-attached and free-living bacteria in the Columbia River, its estuary, and the adjacent coastal ocean were cloned, and 239 partial sequences were determined. A wide diversity was observed at the species level within at least six different bacterial phyla, including most subphyla of the class Proteobacteria. In the estuary, most particle-attached bacterial clones (75\%) were related to members of the genus Cytophaga or of the alpha, gamma, or beta subclass of the class Proteobacteria. These same clones, however, were rare in or absent from either the particle-attached or the free-living bacterial communities of the river and the coastal ocean. In contrast, about half (48\%) of the free-living estuarine bacterial clones were similar to clones from the river or the coastal ocean. These free-living bacteria were related to groups of cosmopolitan freshwater bacteria (beta-proteobacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and Verrucomicrobium spp,) and groups of marine organisms (gram-positive bacteria and alpha-proteobacteria [SAR11 and Rhodobacter spp.]). These results suggest that rapidly growing particle-attached bacteria develop into a uniquely adapted estuarine community and that free-living estuarine bacteria are similar to members of the river and the coastal ocean microbial communities. The high degree of diversity in the estuary is the result of the mixing of bacterial communities from the river, estuary, and coastal ocean.},

  abstract = {Anoxia occurs in bottom waters of stratified estuaries when respiratory consumption of oxygen, primarily by bacteria, outpaces atmospheric and photosynthetic reoxygenation. Once water becomes anoxic, bacterioplankton must change their metabolism to some form of anaerobic respiration. Analysis of redox chemistry in water samples spanning the oxycline of Chesapeake Bay during the summer of 2004 suggested that there was a succession of respiratory metabolism following the loss of oxygen. Bacterial community doubling time, calculated from bacterial abundance (direct counts) and production (anaerobic leucine incorporation), ranged from 0.36 to 0.75 day and was always much shorter than estimates of the time that the bottom water was anoxic (18 to 44 days), indicating that there was adequate time for bacterial community composition to shift in response to changing redox conditions. However, community composition (as determined by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16S rRNA genes) in anoxic waters was very similar to that in surface waters in June when nitrate respiration was apparent in the water column and only partially shifted away from the composition of the surface community after nitrate was depleted. Anoxic water communities did not change dramatically until August, when sulfate respiration appeared to dominate. Surface water populations that remained dominant in anoxic waters were Synechococcus sp., Gammaproteobacteria in the SAR86 clade, and Alphaproteobacteria relatives of Pelagibacter ubique, including a putative estuarine-specific Pelagibacter cluster. Populations that developed in anoxic water were most similar ({$<$}92\% similarity) to uncultivated Firmicutes, uncultivated Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria in the genus Thioalcalovibrio, and the uncultivated SAR406 cluster. These results indicate that typical estuarine bacterioplankton switch to anaerobic metabolism under anoxic conditions but are ultimately replaced by different organisms under sulfidic conditions.},

  abstract = {Marine bacterioplankton in the coastal region off Aveiro (NW Portugal) develop under the influence of the plume of a mesotrophic estuarine system (Ria de Aveiro) and, more recently, under the influence of the discharges of a marine sewage outfall (S. Jacinto). In an attempt to compare the degree of disturbance introduced by these 2 features to the abundance of sewage bacteria and heterotrophic activity of natural bacterioplankton, water samples were collected at 10 offshore and nearshore locations. Rates of ectoenzymatic activity and monomer incorporation were determined as proxies for potential heterotrophic activity of natural bacterial communities. ATP and chl a concentrations were used as estimates of the total abundance of phytoplankton. Faecal coliforms and total colony counts were used as indicators of sewage bacteria contamination. However, ATP, chl a, faecal coliforms, total colony counts, ammopeptidase activity and the maximum rate of leucine incorporation (leucine Vm) correlated negatively with linear distance to the mouth of the estuary, establishing the estuarine plume as an importance source of disturbance. Chl a, aminopeptidase activity and total colony counts also correlated negatively with linear distance to the sewage outfall, but no significant impact on the concentration of faecal bacteria could be detected. Compliance with the European Union Bathing Water Directive 76/160/EEC was achieved in 97\% of samples. The ratio between P-glucosidase activity (polymer degradation) and glucose incorporation (monomer uptake) increased as the distance from the mouth of the estuary and from the sewage outfall increased. This indicates that, in addition to inputs of bacteria and nutrients, changes in the quality of the available organic substrates and/or sewage-related toxic effects may impose a shift in the functioning of heterotrophic bacterioplankton communities in this costal area.},

  abstract = {Large-insert genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries of two culturally and economically important oyster species, Crassostrea virginica and C. gigas, have been developed as part of an international effort to develop tools and reagents that will advance our ability to conduct genetic and genomic research. A total of 73,728 C. gigas clones with an average insert size of 152 kb were picked and arrayed representing an 11.8-fold genome coverage. A total of 55,296 clones with an average insert size of 150 kb were picked and arrayed for C. virginica, also representing an 11.8-fold genome coverage. The C. gigas and C. virginica libraries were screened with probes derived from selected oyster genes using high-density BAC colony filter arrays. The probes identified 4 to 25 clones per gene for C. virginica and 5 to 50 clones per gene for C. gigas. We conducted a preliminary analysis of genetic polymorphism represented in the C. gigas library. The results suggest that the degree of divergence among similar sequences is highly variable and concentrated in intronic regions. Evidence supporting allelic polymorphism is reported for two genes and allelic and/or locus specific polymorphism for several others. Classical inheritance studies are needed to confirm the nature of these polymorphisms. The oyster BAC libraries are publicly available to the research community on a cost-recovery basis at www.genome.clemson.edu.},

In this study, observed floc size versus settling velocity, volume distributions of particles 2μm–1cm in diameter, and calculated effective densities for all particle sizes provided estimates of the mass distribution in suspension, which is used to apportion mass among component particles, microflocs, and macroflocs. Measurements were made during relatively quiescent environmental conditions. Observations of size distributions based on mass demonstrate an increase in the component particle fraction through time. The increase in the percentage of component particles in suspension had implications on water column properties, as small changes in the component particle fraction affected water column optical transmission in a way that was not as easily detected by changes in the volume concentration distribution or total mass concentration. Flocs larger than 133μm in diameter only comprised one quarter to one third of the mass in suspension. This finding may explain why suspension bulk clearance rates are often an order of magnitude lower than those predicted by other methods.},

  abstract = {Fish have been shown to be sensitive indicators of environmental quality   in Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Fish composition also reflects aquatic   macrophyte communities, which provide them with critical habitat.   Although investigators have shown that the relationship between water   quality and fish community structure can be used to indicate wetland   health, we speculate that this relationship is a result of the stronger,   more direct relationship between water quality and macrophytes, together   with the ensuing interconnection between macrophyte and fish   assemblages. In this study, we use data collected from 115 Great Lakes   coastal marshes to test the hypothesis that plants are better predictors   of fish species composition than is water quality. First we use   canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to conduct an ordination of the   fish community constrained by water quality parameters. We then use   co-correspondence analysis (COCA) to conduct a direct ordination of the   fish community with the plant community data. By comparing the statistic   'percent fit,' which refers to the cumulative percentage variance of the   species data, we show that plants are consistently better predictors of   the fish community than are water quality variables in three separate   trials: all wetlands in the Great Lakes basin (whole: 21.2\% vs 14.0\%; n   = 60), all wetlands in Lakes Huron and Superior (Upper: 20.3\% vs 18.8\%;   n = 32), and all wetlands in Georgian Bay and the North Channel   (Georgian Bay: 18\% vs 17\%; n = 70).

  abstract = {A major percentage (20 to 40\%) of global marine fixed-nitrogen loss occurs in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). Concentrations of O2 and the sensitivity of the anaerobic N2-producing processes of anammox and denitrification determine where this loss occurs. We studied experimentally how O2 at nanomolar levels affects anammox and denitrification rates and the transcription of nitrogen cycle genes in the anoxic OMZ off Chile. Rates of anammox and denitrification were reversibly suppressed, most likely at the enzyme level. Fifty percent inhibition of N2 and N2O production by denitrification was achieved at 205 and 297 nM O2, respectively, whereas anammox was 50\% inhibited at 886 nM O2. Coupled metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that transcripts encoding nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), nitrite reductase (nirS), and nitric oxide reductase (norB) decreased in relative abundance above 200 nM O2. This O2 concentration did not suppress the transcription of other dissimilatory nitrogen cycle genes, including nitrate reductase (narG), hydrazine oxidoreductase (hzo), and nitrite reductase (nirK). However, taxonomic characterization of transcripts suggested inhibition of narG transcription in gammaproteobacteria, whereas the transcription of anammox narG, whose gene product is likely used to oxidatively replenish electrons for carbon fixation, was not inhibited. The taxonomic composition of transcripts differed among denitrification enzymes, suggesting that distinct groups of microorganisms mediate different steps of denitrification. Sulfide addition (1 ␮M) did not affect anammox or O2 inhibition kinetics but strongly stimulated N2O production by denitrification. These results identify new O2 thresholds for delimiting marine nitrogen loss and highlight the utility of integrating biogeochemical and metatranscriptomic analyses. IMPORTANCE The removal of fixed nitrogen via anammox and denitrification associated with low O2 concentrations in oceanic oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) is a major sink in oceanic N budgets, yet the sensitivity and dynamics of these processes with respect to O2 are poorly known. The present study elucidated how nanomolar O2 concentrations affected nitrogen removal rates and expression of key nitrogen cycle genes in water from the eastern South Pacific OMZ, applying state-of-the-art 15N techniques and metatranscriptomics. Rates of both denitrification and anammox responded rapidly and reversibly to changes in O2, but denitrification was more O2 sensitive than anammox. The transcription of key nitrogen cycle genes did not respond as clearly to O2, although expression of some of these genes decreased. Quantifying O2 sensitivity of these processes is essential for predicting through which pathways and in which environments, from wastewater treatment to the open oceans, nitrogen removal may occur.},

The area is also important biogeochemically, because the outgassing of recently upwelled water is modulated by contrasting degrees of biological activity. However, very few field measurements of primary production and planktonic respiration have been undertaken within the Eastern Boundary Current (EBC) system off Chile. In this study an estimate of primary production (PP) and surface planktonic community respiration is presented from several research cruises in the HCS and adjacent oceanic areas. The highest production levels were found near the coast correlating closely with known upwelling areas. Both gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration(CR) showed important spatial and temporal fluctuations. The highest water column integrated GPP was measured in the southern and central fishing area (19.9 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and off the Antofagasta upwelling ecosystem (9.3 g C m(-2) d(-1)). The range of GPP agrees well with values reported for Peru (0.05 to 11.7 g C m(-2) d(-1)). The Coquimbo upwelling system, despite being an area of persistent upwelling, showed lower production and community respiration values than the Antofagasta and Concepcion Shelf areas. The lowest surface IPP values were measured within the oceanic region adjacent to the northern coastal upwelling zones (0.8 +/- 0.5 mu g C 1(-1) h(-1)), though slightly enhanced biological production was found within the Nazca Ridge (1.5 +/- 2.1 mu g C 1(-1) h(-1)) that separates the Chilean and Peruvian deep basins.},

  abstract = {Background Marine snow (small amorphous aggregates with colloidal properties) is present in all oceans of the world. Surface water warming and the consequent increase of water column stability can favour the coalescence of marine snow into marine mucilage, large marine aggregates representing an ephemeral and extreme habitat. Marine mucilage characterize aquatic systems with altered environmental conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated, by means of molecular techniques, viruses and prokaryotes within the mucilage and in surrounding seawater to examine the potential of mucilage to host new microbial diversity and/or spread marine diseases. We found that marine mucilage contained a large and unexpectedly exclusive microbial biodiversity and hosted pathogenic species that were absent in surrounding seawater. We also investigated the relationship between climate change and the frequency of mucilage in the Mediterranean Sea over the last 200 years and found that the number of mucilage outbreaks increased almost exponentially in the last 20 years. The increasing frequency of mucilage outbreaks is closely associated with the temperature anomalies. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that the spreading of mucilage in the Mediterranean Sea is linked to climate-driven sea surface warming. The mucilage can act as a controlling factor of microbial diversity across wide oceanic regions and could have the potential to act as a carrier of specific microorganisms, thereby increasing the spread of pathogenic bacteria.},

  abstract = {The morphological and climatic conditions of the Atlantic coast of northern Portugal result in a prevailing upwelling circulation over the continental shelf. A submarine outfall releases wastewater into the ocean c. 3 km directly offshore (at similar to16 m water depth) from S. Jacinto, 5 km to the north of the inlet to the estuarine coastal lagoon system of the Ria de Aveiro. The buoyant plume has a distinctive reddish brown colour and is clearly visible at the water surface. The transport and dispersion of the plume was monitored by airborne photography and by in situ water sampling. Results revealed the surface currents present and water mass fronts in the nearshore zone of the Aveiro coast. During the spring and summer, the plume was not transported offshore in the manner expected by the upwelling shelf circulation. Instead, it was commonly observed to be transported alongshore with the prevailing southerly circulation or with an onshore component. The transport to the south caused the outfall plume to interact with the circulation associated with the tidal currents generated in the inlet channel to the Ria de Aveiro. The observations suggest that the trophic status of the Ria de Aveiro is unlikely to change because of the operation of the submarine outfall. Furthermore, this study demonstrates how simple observations of wastewater discharge from a submarine outfall can be used to improve understanding of nearshore circulation.},

  abstract = {In the ocean, organic particles harbour diverse bacterial communities, which collectively digest and recycle essential nutrients. Traits like motility and exo-enzyme production allow individual taxa to colonize and exploit particle resources, but it remains unclear how community dynamics emerge from these individual traits. Here we track the taxon and trait dynamics of bacteria attached to model marine particles and demonstrate that particle-attached communities undergo rapid, reproducible successions driven by ecological interactions. Motile, particle-degrading taxa are selected for during early successional stages. However, this selective pressure is later relaxed when secondary consumers invade, which are unable to use the particle resource but, instead, rely on carbon from primary degraders. This creates a trophic chain that shifts community metabolism away from the particle substrate. These results suggest that primary successions may shape particle-attached bacterial communities in the ocean and that rapid community-wide metabolic shifts could limit rates of marine particle degradation.},

  abstract = {Timely assessment of the aggregate health of small-area human populations is essential for guiding the optimal investment of resources needed for preventing, avoiding, controlling, or mitigating human exposure risks, as well as for maintaining or promoting health. Seeking those interventions yielding the greatest benefit with respect to the allocation of resources is critical for making progress toward community sustainability, reducing health disparities, promoting social justice, and maintaining or improving collective health and well-being. More informative, faster, and less-costly approaches are needed for guiding investigation of cause-effect linkages involving communities and stressors originating from both the built and natural environments. One such emerging approach involves the continuous monitoring of sewage for chemicals that serve as indicators of the collective status of human health (or stress/disease) or any other facet relevant to gauging time-trends in community-wide health. This nascent approach can be referred to as Sewage Chemical-Information Mining (SCIM) and involves the monitoring of sewage for the information that resides in the form of natural and anthropogenic chemicals that enter sewers as a result of the everyday actions, activities, and behaviors of humans. Of particular interest is a specific embodiment of SCIM that would entail the targeted monitoring of a broad suite of endogenous biomarkers of key physiologic processes (as opposed to xenobiotics or their metabolites). This application is termed BioSCIM—an approach roughly analogous to a hypothetical community-wide collective clinical urinalysis, or to a hypothetical en masse human biomonitoring program. BioSCIM would be used for gauging the status or time-trends in community-wide health on a continuous basis. This paper presents an update on the progress made with the development of the BioSCIM concept in the period of time since its original publication in 2012, as well as the next steps required for its continued development., BioSCIM: sewage chemical-information mining targeted at endogenous biomarkers.,},

  abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic (Coronavirus disease 2019) continues to expose countless unanticipated problems at all levels of the world's complex, interconnected society — global domino effects involving public health and safety, accessible health care, food security, stability of economies and financial institutions, and even the viability of democracies. These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations. An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental scientists over the last 20~years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology — WBE) holds the potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology — one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations.},

The sites in question are characterized by rather complex discharge conditions and irregular topography. These factors are seen to assert significant controls on the spreading of the plumes in the marine receiving waters. Semi-empirical theoretical models are applied to these cases, and the comparisons with the remotely-sensed data are shown to be qualitatively good. The consequences of inadequate and incomplete source data are shown to be serious for quantitative comparisons between held (i.e., remotely-sensed) data and model predictions and examples are presented to show that very good quantitative agreement is obtained when water depths, discharge geometries, source excess temperatures, and crossflow velocities are known with even moderate precision. In contrast, cases are discussed where information on these observables is either not available or of questionable quality; for such cases, quantitative agreement between predicted and observed temperatures is poor, even when plausible estimates are made for the values of missing input data. It is demonstrated that under certain tidal conditions for these sites, the surrounding topography plays a significant role in the dynamics of the cooling water discharge fields, by steering the resulting effluent field, and hence affecting the level of mixing of the effluent with the receiving ambient water. The study has also confirmed the usefulness of the length scale parameterisation approach for the analysis and interpretation of cooling water plume trajectories.},

The dynamics of toxic and non-toxic strains were documented via quantification of the microcystin synthetase gene (mcyD) and ribosomal RNA gene, 16S. During the 2-year field study, Microcystis blooms were comprised of \&gt;106 cell equivalents L−1 and the percentage of toxic strains ranged from 1 to 100\%. The natural microzooplankton community was able to graze on both strains of Microcystis in two-thirds of experiments, with a slight preference for the non-toxic strains in most experiments. Cultured mesozooplankters (Daphnia pulex and Hyalella azteca) grazed at least one strain (toxic or non-toxic) of Microcystis in only one-third of experiments conducted. In contrast, the wild mesozooplankton community grazed at least one strain of Microcystis in every experiment with electivity indices showing a preference towards toxic strains in most experiments. This finding demonstrates that natural mesozooplankton were better grazers of both toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis than their cultured counterparts. Overall, both microzooplankton and mesozooplankton were capable of grazing toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis with similar success and at similar rates. As such, the ability to synthesize microcystin does not seem to offer toxic Microcystis populations a significant defense against grazing by co-occurring zooplankton communities.},

In our study we identified 79 novel CRESS DNA viruses from three mollusc species (Austrovenus stutchburyi, Paphies subtriangulata and Amphibola crenata) and benthic sediments from the Avon-Heathcote estuary in Christchurch, New Zealand. The genomes recovered have varying genome architectures, with all encoding at least two major ORFs that have either unidirectional or bidirectional organisation. Analysis of the Reps of the viral genomes showed they are all highly diverse, with only one Rep sequence sharing 65\% amino acid identity with the Rep of gastropod-associated circular DNA virus (GaCSV). Our study adds significantly to the wealth of CRESS DNA viruses recovered from freshwater and marine environments and extends our knowledge of the distribution of these viruses.},

  abstract = {A new 2° resolution global climatology of the mixed layer depth (MLD) based on individual profiles is constructed. Previous global climatologies have been based on temperature or density-gridded climatologies. The criterion selected is a threshold value of temperature or density from a near-surface value at 10 m depth (ΔT = 0.2°C or Δσθ = 0.03 kg m−3). A validation of the temperature criterion on moored time series data shows that the method is successful at following the base of the mixed layer. In particular, the first spring restratification is better captured than with a more commonly used larger criteria. In addition, we show that for a given 0.2°C criterion, the MLD estimated from averaged profiles results in a shallow bias of 25\% compared to the MLD estimated from individual profiles. A new global seasonal estimation of barrier layer thickness is also provided. An interesting result is the prevalence in mid- and high-latitude winter hemispheres of vertically density-compensated layers, creating an isopycnal but not mixed layer. Consequently, we propose an optimal estimate of MLD based on both temperature and density data. An independent validation of the maximum annual MLD with oxygen data shows that this oxygen estimate may be biased in regions of Ekman pumping or strong biological activity. Significant differences are shown compared to previous climatologies. The timing of the seasonal cycle of the mixed layer is shifted earlier in the year, and the maximum MLD captures finer structures and is shallower. These results are discussed in light of the different approaches and the choice of criterion.},

The novel coronavirus (CoV) recognises, with high probability, a zoonotic origin but the role of animals in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is still largely unknown. However, CoVs have been known in animals since several decades, so that veterinary coronavirologists have a great expertise on how to face CoV infections in animals, which could represent a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. In the present paper, we provide an up-to-date review of the literature currently available on animal CoVs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the emergence of novel CoV strains with different antigenic, biologic and/or pathogenetic features. A full comprehension of the mechanisms driving the evolution of animal CoVs will help better understand the emergence, spreading, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2.},

The role of heterotrophs at the base of the food web in providing energy to the higher trophic levels was studied in temporary ponds in Central and Southern Portugal. The relative quantification of the hetero and autotrophic biomass at the base of the food web in each pond was derived from the polar fatty acid (PLFA) composition of seston through the application of the matrix factorization program CHEMTAX that used specific PLFA and their relative proportion as markers for e.g., classes of bacteria, algae and fungi. The species composition of the culturable microbial communities was identified through their fatty acid profiles. The biomass in the lower trophic level of some ponds presented an even proportion of auto to heterotrophic organisms whilst either bacteria or algae dominated in others. In a selected subset of ponds, the incorporation of bacterial fatty acids was observed to occur in potentially herbivorous zooplankton crustacean. Zooplankton consumed and incorporated bacterial fatty acids into their body tissues, including into their phospholipids, which indicates that energy of heterotrophic origin contributes to the aquatic food webs of temporary ponds.},

We used the scyphomedusa Chrysaora quinquecirrha as a model to examine physical factors that control jellyfish populations and to develop an ecological forecasting system. Over 700 in situ observations collected from Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries during 1987–2000 were used to develop habitat models that predict the probability of occurrence and the likely concentration of medusae as a function of sea-surface temperature and salinity. Medusae were found within a relatively narrow range of temperature (26 to 30°C) and salinity (10 to 16). Regression analyses reveal that a combination of temperature and salinity is a significant predictor of medusa occurrence. Assessments of the predictive performance of these models using medusae and environmental data collected at independent survey sites (n = 354) indicated that model-predicted medusa occurrence and concentration correspond well with observations. Our models can be forced with near-real time and retrospective estimates of temperature and salinity to generate probability of occurrence maps of C. quinquecirrha medusa presence and abundance in order to better understand how this top predator varies in space and time, and how this species could potentially affect energy flow through the Chesapeake Bay system.},

  abstract = {Zooplankton and microbes play a key role in the ocean's biological cycles by releasing and consuming copious amounts of particulate and dissolved organic matter. Additionally, zooplankton provide a complex microhabitat rich in organic and inorganic nutrients in which bacteria thrive. In this study, we assessed the phylogenetic composition and metabolic potential of microbial communities associated with crustacean zooplankton species collected in the North Atlantic. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we found significant differences between the microbial communities associated with zooplankton and those inhabiting the surrounding seawater. Metagenomic analysis of the zooplankton-associated microbial community revealed a highly specialized bacterial community able to exploit zooplankton as microhabitat and thus, mediating biogeochemical processes generally underrepresented in the open ocean. The zooplankton-associated bacterial community is able to colonize the zooplankton's internal and external surfaces using a large set of adhesion mechanisms and to metabolize complex organic compounds released or exuded by the zooplankton such as chitin, taurine and other complex molecules. Moreover, the high number of genes involved in iron and phosphorus metabolisms in the zooplankton-associated microbiome suggests that this zooplankton-associated bacterial community mediates specific biogeochemical processes (through the proliferation of specific taxa) that are generally underrepresented in the ambient waters.},

Here, we explore the possibility of identifying phytoplanktonic biodiversity hotspots from satellite. We define a Shannon entropy index based on patchiness in ocean color bio-optical anomalies. This index provides a high resolution (1 degree) global coverage. It shows a relation to temperature and mid-latitude maxima in accordance with those previously evidenced in microbiological biodiversity model and observational studies. Regional maxima are in remarkable agreement with several known biodiversity hotspots for plankton organisms and even for higher levels of the marine trophic chain, as well as with some in situ planktonic biodiversity estimates (from Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise). These results encourage to explore marine biodiversity with a coordinated effort of the molecular, ecological and remote sensing communities.},

The characteristics of the energy composition of multiple scattering, are analyzed and it is proposed that, based on the model of single scattering, if the flux of the second scattering is considered additionally, the precision of the model will be remarkably improved and the calculation is still very simple. The factor of the second scattering is deduced to build a double scattering model, and the practical arithmetic for the calculation of the model is put forward. The result of applying this model in the water area around the Zhujiang(Pearl) River outfall shows that the precision is obviously improved. The result also shows that the seriously polluted water area is distributed in the northeast of Lingding Sea, the Victoria Bay of Hong Kong, and the Shengzhen Bay.},

From March 1999 through September 2000, paired oyster samples were collected biweekly from two shellfish-growing areas in Mobile Bay, Ala. The presence and densities of V. parahaemolyticus were determined by using DNA probes targeting the thermolabile hemolysin (tlh) and thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh) genes for confirmation of total and pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, respectively. V. parahaemolyticus was detected in all samples with densities ranging from {$<$}10 to 12,000 g−1. Higher V. parahaemolyticus densities were associated with higher water temperatures. Pathogenic strains were detected in 34 (21.8\%) of 156 samples by direct plating or enrichment. Forty-six of 6,018 and 31 of 6,992 V. parahaemolyticus isolates from enrichments and direct plates, respectively, hybridized with the tdh probe. There was an apparent inverse relationship between water temperature and the prevalence of pathogenic strains. Pathogenic strains were of diverse serotypes, and 97\% produced urease and possessed a tdh-related hemolysin (trh) gene. The O3:K6 serotype associated with pandemic spread and recent outbreaks in the United States was not detected. The efficient screening of numerous isolates by colony lift and DNA probe procedures may account for the higher prevalence of samples with tdh+ V. parahaemolyticus than previously reported.},

  abstract = {The biological carbon pump, a fundamental component of the global carbon cycle, is a mechanism comprised of biological processes that transfer large amounts of organic carbon from the upper ocean to the ocean’s interior. It sequesters CO2 for weeks to hundreds or even millions of years through the sinking of a complex mix of biogeo-chemical material. As particles sink the flux of particulate organic carbon attenuates and only a fraction of the flux reaches the ocean’s depth. Quantifying the attenuation of sinking particulate carbon flux is key to assess the amount of carbon sequestered in the twilight zone. Current knowledge of the particle flux attenuation relies on a reduced number of direct measurements, usually fitted to a power law, that tries to describe the result of a large variety of biological, physical and chemical processes involved. We present a stochastic simulation for particle production, sinking and degradation in the oceans that includes most of the essential ingredients to ultimately describe the sinking carbon flux in the ocean and where all the complex biogeochemical behavior is captured by macroscopic parameters. The algorithm proposed interprets these phenomena probabilistically and is an ideal framework to describe the observed patterns of particle flux attenuation in depth. Particles are randomly produced and degraded with depth-dependent functions, which reproduces the variability of these processes in nature. Hence, the simulation proposed provides a suitable approach to analyse sinking carbon when different particle sizes or speeds are used. Furthermore, production and degradation phenomena are time-dependent, this way their seasonal evolution can be additionally explored and the simulation results in an ideal test-bed for the assessment of both steady and non-steady state situations. In addition, the theoretical formulation proposed provides a simple frame to include particle-metals interactions through adsorption and desorption processes. In this paper we relate typical parametrizations of the flux attenuation curve to their corresponding degradation rate and propose an alternative parametrization to model the flux degradation function which is negligible at very large depths, therefore producing a constant residual flux, and remains finite in the euphotic zone. This degradation function is implemented in the simulation and applied to estimate the scavenging of the naturally occurring radioisotopes 234Th and 210Po. We use the results to estimate effective adsorption and desorption rate constants for both isotopes. We found that the degradation rate, rather than the half-life, controls the depth at which the parent and daughter reach equilibrium. Thus, this depth is ruled by a combination of the degradation rate and the particle sinking velocity.},

The mercury-resistant bacteria were found to belong to Pseudomonas, Proteus, Xanthomonas, Alteromonas, Aeromonas, and Enterobacteriaceae. All these environmental bacterial strains tolerant to mercury used in this study were capable of growth at a far higher concentration (50 ppm) of mercury than previously reported. Likewise, their ability to grow in the presence of toxic xenobiotics, either singly or in combination, was superior to that of bacteria incapable of growth in media containing 5 ppm mercury. Plasmid-curing assays done in this study ascertained that resistance to mercury antibiotics, and toxic xenobiotics is mediated by chromosomally borne genes and/or transposable elements rather than by plasmids.},

Spectral analysis of the data shows, however, that the temporal variability also has a large random component. Coherence among all constituent fluxes is very high, indicating that the composition of the sinking material is remarkably uniform throughout periods of greatly changing flux levels. The oxygen isotopic composition of tests of the epipelagic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber intercepted by the trap at a depth of 3200 m represents a reliable recorder of near-surface hydrography one month prior to the tests' arrival in the trap. This tie between hydrographic changes at the surface and changes in quality and quantity of the sediment-trap samples reveals an inverse relationship between surface temperature and the amount of material sinking out of the euphotic zone and injected into deep water. That inverse relationship relates primary sedimentation in the deep sea to the annual cycle of seasons at the sea surface. As the period of lowest surface temperature coincides with the period of greatest mixed-layer depth, and thereby highest nutrient availability, it also confirms the close coupling of sedimentation, including that of abiogenic particles, in the open ocean to primary productivity.},

  abstract = {The ocean's biological pump transfers carbon from the surface euphotic zone into the deep ocean, reducing the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Despite its climatic importance, there are large uncertainties in basic metrics of the biological pump. Previous estimates of the strength of the biological pump, as measured by the amount of organic carbon exported from the euphotic zone, range from about 4–12 Pg C yr−1. The fate of exported carbon, in terms of how efficiently it is transferred into the deep ocean, is even more uncertain. Here we present a new model of the biological pump that assimilates satellite and oceanographic tracer observations to constrain rates and patterns of organic matter production, export and remineralization in the ocean. The data-assimilated model predicts a global particulate organic carbon (POC) flux out of the euphotic zone of ∼9 Pg C yr−1. The particle export ratio (the ratio of POC export to net primary production) is highest at high latitudes and lowest at low latitudes, but low-latitude export is greater than predicted by previous models, in better agreement with observed patterns of long-term carbon export. Particle transfer efficiency (Teff) through the mesopelagic zone is controlled by temperature and oxygen, with highest Teff for high-latitude regions and oxygen minimum zones. In contrast, Teff in the deep ocean (below 1000 m) is controlled by particle sinking speed, with highest deep-ocean Teff below the subtropical gyres. These results emphasize the utility of both remote sensing and oceanographic tracer observations for constraining the operation of the biological pump.},

  abstract = {The sinking and decomposition of particulate organic matter are critical processes in the ocean's biological pump, but are poorly understood and crudely represented in biogeochemical models. Here we present a mechanistic model for particle fluxes in the ocean that solves the evolution of the particle size distribution with depth. The model can represent a wide range of particle flux profiles, depending on the surface particle size distribution, the relationships between particle size, mass and velocity, and the rate of particle mass loss during decomposition. Spatially variable flux profiles are embedded in a data-constrained ocean circulation model, where the most uncertain parameters governing particle dynamics are tuned to achieve an optimal fit to the global distribution of phosphate. The resolution of spatially variable particle sizes has a significant effect on modeled organic matter production rates, increasing production in oligotrophic regions and decreasing production in eutrophic regions compared to a model that assumes spatially uniform particle sizes and sinking fluxes. The mechanistic particle model can reproduce global nutrient distributions better than, and sediment trap fluxes as well as, other commonly used empirical formulas. However, these independent data constraints cannot be simultaneously matched in a closed P budget commonly assumed in ocean models. Through a systematic addition of model processes, we show that the apparent discrepancy between particle flux and nutrient data can be resolved through P burial, but only if that burial is associated with a slowly decaying component of organic matter as might be achieved through protection by ballast minerals. Moreover, the model solution that best matches both datasets requires a larger rate of P burial (and compensating inputs) than have  been previously estimated. Our results imply a marine PO4 inventory with a residence time of a few thousand years, similar to that of the relatively dynamic N cycle.},

Due to their small size, dynamic and episodic nature, these hazards are difficult to sample adequately using traditional in situ oceanographic methods. Complex coastal circulation and persistent cloud cover can further complicate detection and monitoring of these hazards. We use imagery from space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), complemented by field measurements, to examine these hazards in the SCB. The hazards are detectable in SAR imagery because they deposit surfactants on the sea surface, smoothing capillary and small gravity waves to produce areas of reduced backscatter compared with the surrounding ocean. We suggest that high-resolution SAR, which obtains useful data regardless of darkness or cloud cover, could be an important observational tool for assessment and monitoring of coastal marine pollution hazards in the SCB and other urbanized coastal regions.},

In this paper we explore the use of PLFA as chemotaxonomic markers for phytoplankton species. The PLFA composition was determined for 23 species relevant to estuarine phytoplankton. The taxonomic groups investigated were Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Prasinophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Dinophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Rhodophyceae, Pavlovophyceae and Prymnesiophyceae. Most of these taxonomic groups have a characteristic PLFA composition, although a few contain truly unique PLFA biomarkers. The PLFA composition was used to derive species composition and abundance of the phytoplankton in the Scheldt estuary (border region between Belgium and the Netherlands) in April, July and October 2003, using the matrix factorization program CHEMTAX. The results agree well with results from HPLC-derived pigment analysis of the same samples. The advantages of using PLFA instead of pigments, or rather in addition to pigments, are that (1) information on bacteria can be derived in addition to information on photosynthetic taxa, (2) in some cases more or different taxa can be distinguished and (3) the isotopic composition of PLFA can be measured relatively easily, allowing the measurement of group-specific primary production.},

  abstract = {Comparisons of the abundances and size distributions of marine snow (aggregated particles {$>$}0.5mm in diameter) in the upper 100m of the water column at ten stations off Southern California in the late afternoon with those in the same parcel of water the following morning, after nocturnal vertical migration by zooplankton had occurred, revealed the existence of a previously undescribed process affecting marine particle dynamics. Aggregate abundances increased overnight and changes were positively and significantly correlated only with the abundance of the common euphausiid, Euphausia pacifica, and with no other biological or physical factor. Moreover, mean aggregate size decreased and aggregate size distributions shifted toward smaller size classes when euphausiids were abundant. The only conclusion consistent with these findings was that euphausiids were physically disaggregating marine snow into smaller, more numerous aggregates through shear stresses generated while swimming. Video-recording of both tethered and free-swimming E. pacifica in the laboratory dramatically confirmed that aggregates passing within 8–10mm of the animal's abdomen were fragmented either by entrainment and direct impact with the beating pleopods or by eddies generated during swimming. At the abundances observed in this study, swimming E. pacifica would have sufficiently disturbed 3–33\% of the water column each night to disrupt the aggregates contained therein. This is the first evidence for the fragmentation of large particles by the swimming activities of zooplankton and suggests that macrozooplankton and micronekton play a significant role in the particle dynamics of the water column regardless of whether they consume particles or not. Disaggregation of marine snow by swimming and migrating animals may alter the sizes of particles available to grazers and microbial colonizers and reduce the flux of particulate carbon by generating smaller particles, which potentially sink more slowly and reside longer in the water column. This newly discovered process reduces carbon flux while simultaneously conserving carbon and provides a previously unconsidered link between animal behavior and the biogeochemistry of the sea. It may help explain the exponential reduction in particle flux with depth observed in parts of the ocean and help balance oceanic carbon models.},

Little is known, however, about whether aggregates are commonly grazed by zooplankton in the field. While previous laboratory studies have shown that the euphausiid Euphausia pacifica, and the copepod, Calanus pacificus, common crustacean zooplankters, consume marine snow if it is the only food source available, it is not known if euphausiids will select marine snow in the presence of edible dispersed cells, as readily occurs in nature. To examine this question, we offered E. pacifica the diatom, Nitzschia angularis in aggregated and dispersed form as prey simultaneously. Aggregates and dispersed food contained identical cell types so that differing prey quality, taste or motility would not be a factor. A new method was developed to track food sources by labeling the frustules of aggregated cells with different naturally occurring, but rare, stable isotopes of silicon, 30Si and 29Si. Food selection was then estimated by measuring the isotopic composition of silica within fecal pellets produced by animals feeding on mixtures of the two labeled foods. Results indicate that E. pacifica consumed both aggregates and dispersed cells, even when more cells were made available in dispersed form than in aggregated form. This suggests that aggregates may indeed be a food source in the field, even when dispersed cells are relatively abundant. The method of labeling diatom cells with stable isotopes of silica may prove useful for future grazing experiments to distinguish identical cell types.},

  abstract = {The seasonal dynamics of the Southern California Current (SCC) is investigated using a primitive equation ocean model with real coastlines and topography. The model is tested with different wind forcing, and the resulting flow fields are compared to the mean and seasonal circulation inferred from long-term in situ observations (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI)). The model integration forced with the output winds of a regional atmospheric model (RSM) best captures the statistics of the observed circulation, with a 0.9 correlation coefficient for the streamlines and 0.5 for the velocity fields. The model integrations reveal a pronounced linear response of the flow field to changes in winds on the shelf region. A dynamical feature inferred from CalCOFI hydrography, also suggested in TOPEX/ERS maps, is an annually recurrent westward propagation of SSH anomalies originated in the Southern California Bight (SCB) during the upwelling season. The RSM integration is the only one to capture the correct timing and spatial evolution of this process. We therefore use this model integration for guidance in constructing a dynamical framework to interpret the observed circulation and its variability. During the upwelling season in spring, there is an upward tilt of the isopycnals along the coast directly forced by the winds in the Bight. As the spring transitions to the summer the upwelling winds relax in the Bight but are still strong in the region offshore, approximately in correspondence of the continental slope (positive wind-stress curl condition). Anomalous denser waters in the location of the Southern California Eddy are maintained and reinforced by the combined interaction of the coastal/islands geometry and the wind-stress curl (through Ekman dynamics). The adjustment process to the denser water initiates a westward propagation of ocean density anomaly through Rossby waves, and reinforces the cyclonic gyre-like circulation of the SCE (increasing positive vorticity). Surface poleward flow, maintained by the positive wind-stress curl, is also reinforced in proximity of Point Conception as a consequence of the adjustment. During the summer the cyclonic gyre becomes increasingly unstable as the core of the ocean anomalies crosses the continental slope. Instability processes within the cyclonic region, characterized by a sharp increase in EKE, shed eddies that leave the region either drifting to the west or interacting with existing eddies in the region offshore. The EKE reaches a seasonal maximum at the end the summer in the cyclonic region, and in late fall further offshore where the eddies are fully developed. The shedding of eddies cannot be directly seen in the CalCOFI observations because of the sampling aliasing. For this point we rely on the strong suggestion of the model, which we assume is able to capture the leading order dynamics. Additional integrations with a linearized version of the model are also presented to reinforce our interpretation of the westward propagation of the isopycnal anomalous displacement associated with Rossby wave dynamics.},

We consider the origins of this phenomenon, the implications of spatial autocorrelation for macro?scale patterns of species diversity and set out a clarification of the statistical problems generated by its presence. Location To illustrate the issues involved, we analyse the species richness of the birds of western/central Europe, north Africa and the Middle East. Methods Spatial correlograms for richness and five environmental variables were generated using Moran's I coefficients. Multiple regression, using both ordinary least?squares (OLS) and generalized least squares (GLS) assuming a spatial structure in the residuals, were used to identify the strongest predictors of richness. Autocorrelation analyses of the residuals obtained after stepwise OLS regression were undertaken, and the ranks of variables in the full OLS and GLS models were compared. Results Bird richness is characterized by a quadratic north?south gradient. Spatial correlograms usually had positive autocorrelation up to c. 1600~km. Including the environmental variables successively in the OLS model reduced spatial autocorrelation in the residuals to non?detectable levels, indicating that the variables explained all spatial structure in the data. In principle, if residuals are not autocorrelated then OLS is a special case of GLS. However, our comparison between OLS and GLS models including all environmental variables revealed that GLS de?emphasized predictors with strong autocorrelation and long?distance clinal structures, giving more importance to variables acting at smaller geographical scales. Conclusion Although spatial autocorrelation should always be investigated, it does not necessarily generate bias. Rather, it can be a useful tool to investigate mechanisms operating on richness at different spatial scales. Claims that analyses that do not take into account spatial autocorrelation are flawed are without foundation.},

  abstract = {Natural or spilled oil in the ocean can interact with marine snow and sediment from riverine sources and form Marine Oil Snow (MOS) aggregates including aggregates consisting of phytoplankton, detritus, and feces. Such aggregates have a fractal structure and can transport oil from the surface layers to greater depths in the ocean, eventually settling on the seafloor. In recent studies of the Deepwater Horizon and IXTOC-1 oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, this process was identified as one of the main mechanisms for transporting oil vertically in the water column. We have adapted a stochastic, one-dimensional numerical model that uses coagulation theory to simulate MOS formation and sinking in the ocean and predict the time evolution of physical properties and spatial distribution of MOS. Here we present the model development, calibration, and validation with measured MOS field data in the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon spill. We use a sensitivity analysis to identify critical parameters, and suggest future model improvements and areas where further experimental investigation is needed to improve our understanding of MOS formation and sedimentation. The model can be used during response and planning activities associated with oil spills in the marine environments.},

  abstract = {The oceanic circulation in the Southern California Bight (SCB) is influenced by the large-scale California Current offshore, tropical remote forcing through the coastal wave guide alongshore, and local atmospheric forcing. The region is characterized by local complexity in the topography and coastline. All these factors engender variability in the circulation on interannual, seasonal, and intraseasonal time scales. This study applies the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) to the SCB circulation and its multiple-scale variability. The model is configured in three levels of nested grids with the parent grid covering the whole US West Coast. The first child grid covers a large southern domain, and the third grid zooms in on the SCB region. The three horizontal grid resolutions are 20km, 6.7km, and 1km, respectively. The external forcings are momentum, heat, and freshwater flux at the surface and adaptive nudging to gyre-scale SODA reanalysis fields at the boundaries. The momentum flux is from a three-hourly reanalysis mesoscale MM5 wind with a 6km resolution for the finest grid in the SCB. The oceanic model starts in an equilibrium state from a multiple-year cyclical climatology run, and then it is integrated from years 1996 through 2003. In this paper, the 8-year simulation at the 1km resolution is analyzed and assessed against extensive observational data: High-Frequency (HF) radar data, current meters, Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) data, hydrographic measurements, tide gauges, drifters, altimeters, and radiometers. The simulation shows that the domain-scale surface circulation in the SCB is characterized by the Southern California Cyclonic Gyre, comprised of the offshore equatorward California Current System and the onshore poleward Southern California Countercurrent. The simulation also exhibits three subdomain-scale, persistent (i.e., standing), cyclonic eddies related to the local topography and wind forcing: the Santa Barbara Channel Eddy, the Central-SCB Eddy, and the Catalina-Clemente Eddy. Comparisons with observational data reveal that ROMS reproduces a realistic mean state of the SCB oceanic circulation, as well as its interannual (mainly as a local manifestation of an ENSO event), seasonal, and intraseasonal (eddy-scale) variations. We find high correlations of the wind curl with both the alongshore pressure gradient (APG) and the eddy kinetic energy level in their variations on time scales of seasons and longer. The geostrophic currents are much stronger than the wind-driven Ekman flows at the surface. The model exhibits intrinsic eddy variability with strong topographically related heterogeneity, westward-propagating Rossby waves, and poleward-propagating coastally-trapped waves (albeit with smaller amplitude than observed due to missing high-frequency variations in the southern boundary conditions).},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli is a widely utilized indicator of the sanitary quality of bivalve molluscan shellfish sold for human consumption. However, it is now well documented that shellfish that meet the E. coli standards for human consumption may contain human enteric viruses that cause gastroenteritis and hepatitis. In this study we investigated using F-specific RNA bacteriophage (FRNA bacteriophage) to indicate the likely presence of such viruses in shellfish sold for consumption. FRNA bacteriophage and E. coli levels were determined over a 2-year period for oysters (Crassostrea gigas) harvested from four commercial sites chosen to represent various degrees of sewage pollution. Three sites were classified as category B sites under the relevant European Community (EC) Directive (91/492), which required purification (depuration) of oysters from these sites before sale. One site was classified as a category A site, and oysters from this site could be sold directly without further processing. Samples were tested at the point of sale following commercial processing and packaging. All of the shellfish complied with the mandatory EC E. coli standard (less than 230 per 100 g of shellfish flesh), and the levels of contamination for more than 90\% of the shellfish were at or below the level of sensitivity of the assay (20 E. coli MPN per 100 g), which indicated good quality based on this criterion. In contrast, FRNA bacteriophage were frequently detected at levels that exceeded 1,000 PFU per 100 g. High levels of FRNA bacteriophage contamination were strongly associated with harvest area fecal pollution and with shellfish-associated disease outbreaks. Interestingly, FRNA bacteriophage contamination exhibited a marked seasonal trend that was consistent with the trend of oyster-associated gastroenteritis in the United Kingdom. The correlation between FRNA bacteriophage contamination and health risk was investigated further by using a reverse transcription-PCR assay for Norwalk-like virus (NLV). NLV contamination of oysters was detected only at the most polluted site and also exhibited a seasonal trend that was consistent with the trend of FRNA bacteriophage contamination and with the incidence of disease. The results of this study suggest that FRNA bacteriophage could be used as viral indicators for market-ready oysters.},

  abstract = {Studies of the distribution of suspended particulate matter in the waters over Hueneme, Redondo, Newport, and La Jolla submarine canyons off southern California are combined with analyses of recordings of canyon-floor currents to evaluate the influence of canyons on the seaward dispersal of fine, terrigenous sediment. The canyon surveys were undertaken during the fall and winter months of 1971 to 1973 when suspended-sediment concentrations and composition over the mainland shelf are controlled principally by terrigenous-sediment supply. Consequently, particle concentrations at all levels generally increased toward the coast; highest values, exceeding 6 mg per 1, were present in the Newport and Hueneme areas because of the relative proximity of large rivers. The vertical distribution of suspended particulate matter is influenced strongly by the density structure of the water column on the shelf and slope, and sharply bounded, midwater, turbidity maxima are well developed over the shelf where sediment supply is comparatively large. Nepheloid layers were present and ranged from a few meters to {$>$}200 m in thickness with peak particle concentrations of 5 to 7 mg per 1 over the inner shelf and within the steep-walled, headward portions of each canyon. Although a nepheloid layer is a characteristic component of suspensate distribution in all sampled areas, maximum particle concentrations were {$<$} 10 mg per 1 and therefore were far below those required to penetrate the water-column stratification and to produce significant density underflows. Nevertheless, computation by a modified Chézy formula of mean flow velocity due to suspended sediment above the canyon axes suggests that the slow, net downcanyon water transport demonstrated by Shepard and Marshall (1973) may be explained in part by the mechanism of turbid-layer flow. This conclusion is tentative, and the mechanism can only be evaluated adequately when more measurements of canyon currents and suspended sediment become available.},

  abstract = {Studies of the distribution of suspended particulate matter in submarine canyons off southern California are reported. Simultaneously collected light beam transmission and salinity/ temperature data demonstrate an association of particle maxima with the relatively steep segments of the vertical, water-density gradient over shelf, slope, and canyon environments. Within the submarine canyons that cut the mainland shelf, mid-water particle maxima contain high percentages of terrigenous detritus supplied by seacard flew from canyon nepheloid layers. The concentrations of particulate matter in the canyon nepheloid layers rarely, if ever, exceed 10 mg/l even in areas close to major rivers; typical peak values in the canyon heads are 3 to 6 mg/l. It is concluded that turbid-layer, density-excess underflows are not possible at these low concentrations. Further, the suggestion of an earlier report that the slow, net downcanyon transport in Pacific coast canyons could be driven by the suspended particles is not supported by our most recent results from Santa Cruz Canyon. Bottom currents in this canyon are vigorous and show a net downcanyon flow that is far too strong to be explained by turbid-layer flow. While submarine canyons off southern California are an important pathway for fine sediment leaving the shelf, it is likely that no more than 10–15\% of the annual terrigenous supply moves to deeper water by way of the canyons.},

One unquantified risk of aquatic biological invasions is the potential for biofilms within ships’ ballast water tanks to harbor pathogens, and, in turn, seed other waters. To begin to evaluate this vector, we collected biofilm samples from tanks’ surfaces and deployed controlled-surface sampling units within tanks. We then measured a variety of microbial metrics within the biofilms to test the hypotheses that pathogens are present in biofilms and that biofilms have higher microbial densities compared to ballast water. Field experiments and sampling of coastwise and oceangoing ships arriving at ports in Chesapeake Bay and the North American Great Lakes showed the presence of abundant microorganisms, including pathogens, in biofilms. These results suggest that ballast-tank biofilms represent an additional risk of microbial invasion, provided they release cells into the water or they are sloughed off during normal ballasting operations.},

  abstract = {A prominent vector of aquatic invasive species to coastal regions is the discharge of water, sediments, and biofilm from ships’ ballastwater tanks. During eight years of studying ships arriving to the lower Chesapeake Bay, we developed an understanding of the mechanisms by which invasive microorganisms might arrive to the region via ships. Within a given ship, habitats included ballast water, unpumpable water and sediment (collectively known as residuals), and biofilms formed on internal surfaces of ballast-water tanks. We sampled 69 vessels arriving from foreign and domestic ports, largely from Western Europe, the Mediterranean region, and the US East and Gulf coasts. All habitats contained bacteria and viruses. By extrapolating the measured concentration of a microbial metric to the estimated volume of ballast water, biofilm, or residual sediment and water within an average vessel, we calculated the potential total number of microorganisms contained by each habitat, thus creating a hierarchy of risk of delivery. The estimated concentration of microorganisms was greatest in ballast water ) sediment and water residuals ) biofilms. From these results, it is clear microorganisms may be transported within ships in a variety of ways. Using temperature tolerance as a measure of survivability and the temperature difference between ballast-water samples and the water into which the ballast water was discharged, we estimated 56\% of microorganisms could survive in the lower Bay. Extrapolated delivery and survival of microorganisms to the Port of Hampton Roads in lower Chesapeake Bay shows on the order of 1020 microorganisms (6.8 · 1019 viruses and 3.9 · 1018 bacteria cells) are discharged annually to the region.},

  abstract = {The Mediterranean climate exerts a major influence on the basic properties of the Mediterranean Sea, which constrains the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem. Seasonal variations in the marine climate follow the expected unimodal seasonality only for temperature, while most other forcing factors show a complex variance structure, with dominant time scales of 50–100 days (e.g. wave action), and with some of the factors acting as random factors (‘white noise’) at the annual scale (e.g. rainfall), thereby limiting the predictability of the system. The resulting ecosystem seasonality is unconventional and poorly linked to temperature. The prolonged period of high atmospheric pressure and associated high irradiance and calm waters in late winter is the main seasonal trigger in the NW Mediterranean Sea, setting the development of a phytoplankton bloom, as well as the recruitment of the benthos. Decadal changes in the Mediterranean marine climate are characterized by the dominance of oscillations with a 22-year period, suggesting an important solar forcing on the climate. This forcing masks the monotonous trends, such as the warming and increased sea level in the Mediterranean, expected from anthropogenic forcing. Records of decadal changes in the ecosystem often display a monotonous trend in the deterioration of water quality, indicative of human effects as the main forcing agent, while climatic forcing, which displays oscillatory variation, is of secondary importance. The paucity of long-term records precludes a robust analysis of ecosystem response to decadal climatic forcing. This absence can be partially remediated by the ability to interrogate the long-lived organisms that represent an important, albeit endangered component of Mediterranean biodiversity, to extract records (e.g. growth, temperature, changes in the nature of the dissolved inorganic carbon pool) of the changes they have witnessed.},

  abstract = {A census of clean room surface-associated bacterial populations was derived from the results of both the cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and DNA microarray (PhyloChip) analyses. Samples from the Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Multiple Testing Facility (LMA-MTF), the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazard and Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF), and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF) clean rooms were collected during the various assembly phases of the Phoenix and Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) spacecraft. Clone library-derived analyses detected a larger bacterial diversity prior to the arrival of spacecraft hardware in these clean room facilities. PhyloChip results were in agreement with this trend but also unveiled the presence of anywhere from 9- to 70-fold more bacterial taxa than cloning approaches. Among the facilities sampled, the JPL-SAF (MSL mission) housed a significantly less diverse bacterial population than either the LMA-MTF or KSC-PHSF (Phoenix mission). Bacterial taxa known to thrive in arid conditions were frequently detected in MSL-associated JPL-SAF samples, whereas proteobacterial lineages dominated Phoenix-associated KSC-PHSF samples. Comprehensive bacterial censuses, such as that reported here, will help space-faring nations preemptively identify contaminant biomatter that may compromise extraterrestrial life detection experiments. The robust nature and high sensitivity of DNA microarray technologies should prove beneficial to a wide range of scientific, electronic, homeland security, medical, and pharmaceutical applications and to any other ventures with a vested interest in monitoring and controlling contamination in exceptionally clean environments.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the improved estimation of mesoscale surface ocean circulation obtained by merging TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) and ERS-1 and -2 altimeter measurements between October 1992 and May 1998. Once carefully intercalibrated and homogenized, these data are merged through an advanced global objective analysis method that allows us to correct for residual long wavelength errors and uses realistic correlation scales of ocean dynamics. The high-resolution (0.25°×0.25°) merged T/P+ERS-1 and -2 sea level anomaly maps provide more homogeneous and reduced mapping errors than either individual data set and more realistic sea level and geostrophic velocity statistics than T/P data alone. Furthermore, the merged T/P+ERS-1 and -2 maps yield eddy kinetic energy (EKE) levels 30\% higher than maps of T/P alone. They also permit realistic global estimates of east and north components of EKE and their seasonal variations, to study EKE sources better. A comparison of velocity statistics with World Ocean Circulation Experiment surface drifters in the North Atlantic shows very good agreement. Comparison with contemporary current meter data in various oceanic regimes also produces comparable levels of energy and similar ratios of northward and eastward energy, showing that the maps are suitable to studying anisotropy. The T/P + ERS zonal and meridional components of the mapped currents usually present comparable rms variability, even though the variability in the Atlantic is more isotropic than that in the Pacific, which exhibits strong zonal changes. The EKE map presents a very detailed description, presumably never before achieved at a global scale. Pronounced seasonal changes of the EKE are found in many regions, notably the northeastern Pacific, the northeastern and northwestern Atlantic, the tropical oceans, and the zonally extended bands centered near 20°S in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans and at 20°N in the northwestern Pacific.},

Monthly high spring tides cause salinity destratification in the moderately stratified estuary, which oscillates between stratified (top-to-bottom salinity difference {$>$}1‰) and vertically homogeneous (salinity difference {$<$}1‰) conditions on a time scale of 1–10 days. Bacterial abundance and carbon biomass ranged from 1 to 8 × 109 cells · liter’ and 20 to 100 µg C · liter−1. Thymidine incorporation into cold TCA-insoluble fractions ranged from 1 to 10 × 10−9 mol · liter 1 · d−1; bacterial carbon production rates and specific growth rates were estimated at 7–75 µg C· liter−1 · d−1 and 0.2–1.1 · d−1. Biomass increased steadily during the destratification process while production remained constant. Production then increased twofold to threefold in 12 h during the period of maximum water-column homogeneity. Increased vertical mixing and possibly stimulation of phytoplankton production are suggested as the major causes of this bacterial response to destratification.},

  abstract = {There has been an explosion of research on marine microbial foodweb processes in the past decade. Today it is widely accepted that about 50\% of the primary production in marine and fresh water is processed by bacteria each day (Williams, 1981; Cole et al., 1988). This striking finding was stimulated, as others have noted, by the introduction of convenient methods for the estimation of microbial biomass and activities in natural waters. Hobbie et al. (1977) and Watson et al. (1977) demonstrated conclusively that bacterial populations in the sea were large. By 1980, in addition to the pioneering and prescient work by Sorokin (e.g., Sorokin, 1971, 1973), reports of bacterial production measurements had begun to emerge (Sieburth et al., 1977; Karl, 1979; Larsson and Hagstrom, 1979; Fuhrman and Azam, 1980). Brock (1971) and Sieburth (1977) wrote early reviews on the subject, and Pomeroy (1974) introduced the importance of marine microbial processes to a large audience. In this chapter we review recent research on bacterial production in the ocean. The emphasis is on the open sea, but we will also discuss other marine habitats, partly because there are still few comprehensive studies of oceanic bacterial production. There is an equally large and rapidly growing literature on bacterial production in fresh waters (Cole et al., 1988; Currie, 1990) which deserves a review of its own, as well as comparison with the marine findings (Hobbie, 1988). We will not review related work in sediments, nor for the most part, related work on bacteriovores.},

However, establishment success also depends on the environment to which species are introduced: for a given species, some locations will be more favourable for establishment than others. * We present equations for modelling the expected relationship between establishment probability and founding population size when demographic stochasticity, Allee effects and, for the first time, environmental heterogeneity are operating. * We show that heterogeneity in environmental conditions can change the shape of the relationship between establishment probability and founding population size through a disproportionate decline in the probability of establishment in larger populations, the opposite of an Allee effect. This outcome is likely in most empirical data sets relating founding population size to establishment probability, and highlights that unfavourable environments are often the major cause of establishment failures. It also emphasizes the insights that can be gained from applying models with a theoretical underpinning.},

  abstract = {As dominant members of marine mesozooplankton communities, copepods play critical roles in oceanic food webs and biogeochemical cycling. Despite the ecological significance of copepods, little is known regarding the causes of copepod mortality, and up to 35\% of total copepod mortality cannot be accounted for by predation alone. Viruses have been established as ecologically important infectious agents in the oceans; however, viral infection has not been investigated in mesozooplankton communities. Here we used molecular and microscopic techniques to document viral infection in natural populations of the calanoid copepods Acartia tonsa (Dana) and Labidocera aestiva (Wheeler) in Tampa Bay, FL. Viral metagenomics revealed previously undocumented viruses in each species, named Acartia tonsa copepod circo-like virus (AtCopCV) and Labidocera aestiva copepod circo-like virus (LaCopCV). LaCopCV was found to be extremely prevalent and abundant in L. aestiva populations, with up to 100\% prevalence in some samples and average viral loads of 1.13 × 105 copies per individual. LaCopCV transcription was also detected in the majority of L. aestiva individuals, indicating viral activity. AtCopCV was sporadically detected in A. tonsa populations year-round, suggesting temporal variability in viral infection dynamics. Finally, virus-like particles of unknown identity were observed in the connective tissues of A. tonsa and L. aestiva by transmission electron microscopy, demonstrating that viruses were actively proliferating in copepod connective tissue as opposed to infecting gut contents, parasites, or symbionts. Taken together, these results provide strong independent lines of evidence for active viral infection in dominant copepod species, indicating that viruses may significantly influence mesozooplankton ecology.},

To calibrate these models, we have compiled a synthesis of field observations related to ecosystem size structure, primary production and particle export from around the globe. The empirical model captures 61\% of the observed variance in the ratio of particle export to primary production (the pe ratio) using sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll concentrations (or primary productivity) as predictor variables. To describe the mechanisms responsible for pe-ratio variability, we present size-based formulations of phytoplankton grazing and sinking particle export, combining them into an alternative, mechanistic model. The formulation of grazing dynamics, using simple power laws as closure terms for small and large phytoplankton, reproduces 74\% of the observed variability in phytoplankton community composition wherein large phytoplankton augment small ones as production increases. The formulation for sinking particle export partitions a temperature-dependent fraction of small and large phytoplankton grazing into sinking detritus. The mechanistic model also captures 61\% of the observed variance in pe ratio, with large phytoplankton in high biomass and relatively cold regions leading to more efficient export. In this model, variability in primary productivity results in a biomass-modulated switch between small and large phytoplankton pathways.},

  abstract = {Networks from a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems have been recently described as “small-world” and “scale-free.” However, studies disagree whether ecological networks called food webs possess the characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions required for membership in these classes of networks. Our analysis suggests that the disagreements are based on selective use of relatively few food webs, as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25–172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that although some food webs have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal functional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power–law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.},

These models demonstrate good climate fidelity as described in part I of this study while incorporating explicit and consistent carbon dynamics. The two models differ almost exclusively in the physical ocean component; ESM2M uses the Modular Ocean Model version 4.1 with vertical pressure layers, whereas ESM2G uses generalized ocean layer dynamics with a bulk mixed layer and interior isopycnal layers. On land, both ESMs include a revised land model to simulate competitive vegetation distributions and functioning, including carbon cycling among vegetation, soil, and atmosphere. In the ocean, both models include new biogeochemical algorithms including phytoplankton functional group dynamics with flexible stoichiometry. Preindustrial simulations are spun up to give stable, realistic carbon cycle means and variability. Significant differences in simulation characteristics of these two models are described. Because of differences in oceanic ventilation rates, ESM2M has a stronger biological carbon pump but weaker northward implied atmospheric CO2 transport than ESM2G. The major advantages of ESM2G over ESM2M are improved representation of surface chlorophyll in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and thermocline nutrients and oxygen in the North Pacific. Improved tree mortality parameters in ESM2G produced more realistic carbon accumulation in vegetation pools. The major advantages of ESM2M over ESM2G are reduced nutrient and oxygen biases in the southern and tropical oceans.},

The two models differ exclusively in the physical ocean component; ESM2M uses Modular Ocean Model version 4p1 with vertical pressure layers while ESM2G uses Generalized Ocean Layer Dynamics with a bulk mixed layer and interior isopycnal layers. Differences in the ocean mean state include the thermocline depth being relatively deep in ESM2M and relatively shallow in ESM2G compared to observations. The crucial role of ocean dynamics on climate variability is highlighted in El Niño–Southern Oscillation being overly strong in ESM2M and overly weak in ESM2G relative to observations. Thus, while ESM2G might better represent climate changes relating to total heat content variability given its lack of long-term drift, gyre circulation, and ventilation in the North Pacific, tropical Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, and depth structure in the overturning and abyssal flows, ESM2M might better represent climate changes relating to surface circulation given its superior surface temperature, salinity, and height patterns, tropical Pacific circulation and variability, and Southern Ocean dynamics. The overall assessment is that neither model is fundamentally superior to the other, and that both models achieve sufficient fidelity to allow meaningful climate and earth system modeling applications. This affords the ability to assess the role of ocean configuration on earth system interactions in the context of two state-of-the-art coupled carbon–climate models.},

  abstract = {Bacteria in the 16S rRNA clade SAR86 are among the most abundant uncultivated constituents of microbial assemblages in the surface ocean for which little genomic information is currently available. Bioinformatic techniques were used to assemble two nearly complete genomes from marine metagenomes and single-cell sequencing provided two more partial genomes. Recruitment of metagenomic data shows that these SAR86 genomes substantially increase our knowledge of non-photosynthetic bacteria in the surface ocean. Phylogenomic analyses establish SAR86 as a basal and divergent lineage of γ-proteobacteria, and the individual genomes display a temperature-dependent distribution. Modestly sized at 1.25–1.7 Mbp, the SAR86 genomes lack several pathways for amino-acid and vitamin synthesis as well as sulfate reduction, trends commonly observed in other abundant marine microbes. SAR86 appears to be an aerobic chemoheterotroph with the potential for proteorhodopsin-based ATP generation, though the apparent lack of a retinal biosynthesis pathway may require it to scavenge exogenously-derived pigments to utilize proteorhodopsin. The genomes contain an expanded capacity for the degradation of lipids and carbohydrates acquired using a wealth of tonB-dependent outer membrane receptors. Like the abundant planktonic marine bacterial clade SAR11, SAR86 exhibits metabolic streamlining, but also a distinct carbon compound specialization, possibly avoiding competition.},

The eukaryotic phytoplankton were dominated by populations of small nanoplankton (mostly 2–4 μm diameter), though populations of coccolithophores and sometimes pennate diatoms also could be distinguished. Flow cytometric measurements of population abundances, individual cell light scattering (which can be related to cell size), and chlorophyll fluorescence were made. Synechococcus and the eukaryotic phytoplankton reached their greatest concentrations during the spring bloom each year when the water column was deeply mixed and nutrients were detectable in surface waters. The maximum cell concentration for Prochlorococcus was in the summer and fall of each year, with a deeper sub-surface maximum than Synechococcus. Picoplankton chlorophyll fluorescence and estimated cell size were greater at depth than near the surface, and were lowest in midsummer for both Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. In the summer and fall, Prochlorococcus cells were often smallest at mid-depth, even when fluorescence per cell and cell concentration were lower at the surface. For the eukaryotes (including coccolithophores), cell concentrations were high during the spring in both 1992 and 1993, and in fall 1992. At these times, mean cell size and fluorescence were low. Improved size and carbon estimates were made and it was found that the estimated contribution of phytoplankton carbon to total particulate organic carbon, integrated over the upper 200 m, averaged 33\% (range 21–43\%) with no pronounced seasonal pattern.},

OMZ formation is often fueled by high surface primary production, and sinking organic particles can be hotspots of interactions and activity within microbial communities. This study investigated the diversity of OMZ protist communities in two biomass size fractions ({$>$}30 and 30–1.6 μm filters) from the world’s largest permanent OMZ in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Diversity was quantified via Illumina MiSeq sequencing of V4 region of 18S SSU rRNA genes in samples spanning oxygen gradients at two stations. Alveolata and Rhizaria dominated the two size fractions at both sites along the oxygen gradient. Community composition at finer taxonomic levels was partially shaped by oxygen concentration, as communities associated with versus anoxic waters shared only ∼32\% of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) (97\% sequence identity) composition. Overall, only 9.7\% of total OTUs were recovered at both stations and under all oxygen conditions sampled, implying structuring of the eukaryotic community in this area. Size-fractionated communities exhibited different taxonomical features (e.g. Syndiniales Group I in the 1.6–30 μm fraction) that could be explained by the microniches created on the surface-originated sinking particles.},

  abstract = {Carbon and nutrients are transported out of the surface ocean and sequestered at depth by sinking particles. Sinking particle sizes span many orders of magnitude and the relative influence of small particles on carbon export compared to large particles has not been resolved. To determine the influence of particle size on carbon export, the flux of both small (11–64μm) and large ({$>$}64μm) particles in the upper mesopelagic was examined during 5 cruises of the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) in the Sargasso Sea using neutrally buoyant sediment traps mounted with tubes containing polyacrylamide gel layers and tubes containing a poisoned brine layer. Particles were also collected in surface-tethered, free-floating traps at higher carbon flux locations in the tropical and subtropical South Atlantic Ocean. Particle sizes spanning three orders of magnitude were resolved in gel samples, included sinking particles as small as 11μm. At BATS, the number flux of small particles tended to increase with depth, whereas the number flux of large particles tended to decrease with depth. The carbon content of different sized particles could not be modeled by a single set of parameters because the particle composition varied across locations and over time. The modeled carbon flux by small particles at BATS, including all samples and depths, was 39±20\% of the modeled total carbon flux, and the percentage increased with depth in 4 out of the 5months sampled. These results indicate that small particles ({$<$}64μm) are actively settling in the water column and are an important contributor to carbon flux throughout the mesopelagic. Observations and models that overlook these particles will underestimate the vertical flux of organic matter in the ocean.},

  abstract = {The composition of sinking particles and the mechanisms leading to their transport ultimately control how much carbon is naturally sequestered in the deep ocean by the “biological pump.” While detrital particles often contain much of the sinking carbon, sinking of intact phytoplankton cells can also contribute to carbon export, which represents a direct flux of carbon from the atmosphere to the deep ocean by circumventing the surface ocean food web. Phytoplankton that contributed to carbon flux were identified in sinking material collected by short-term sediment trap deployments conducted along a transect off the eastern shore of South America. Particulate organic carbon flux at 125 m depth did not change significantly along the transect. Instead, changes occurred in the composition and association of phytoplankton with detrital particles. The fluxes of diatoms, coccolithophores, dinoflagellates, and nano-sized cells at 125 m were unrelated to the overlying surface population abundances, indicating that functional-group specific transport mechanisms were variable across locations. The dominant export mechanism of phytoplankton at each station was putatively identified by principal component analysis and fell into one of three categories; (1) transport and sinking of individual, viable diatom cells, (2) transport by aggregates and fecal pellets, or (3) enhanced export of coccolithophores through direct settling and/or aggregation.},

The retention and export of these materials inside a system depends on the residence time (RT). A long-term simulation of time-varying RT of the Chesapeake Bay was conducted over the period from 1980 to 2012. The 33-year simulation results show that the mean RT of the entire Chesapeake Bay system ranges from 110 to 264days, with an average value of 180days. The RT was larger in the bottom layers than in the surface layers due to the persistent stratification and estuarine circulation. A clear seasonal cycle of RT was found, with a much smaller RT in winter than in summer, indicating materials discharged in winter would be quickly transported out of the estuary due to the winter-spring high flow. Large interannual variability of the RT was highly correlated with the variability of river discharge (R2=0.92). The monthly variability of RT can be partially attributed to the variability of estuarine circulation. A strengthened estuarine circulation results in a larger bottom influx and thus reduces the RT. Wind exerts a significant impact on the RT. The upstream wind is more important in controlling the lateral pattern of RT in the mainstem.},

Large between-county disparities were evident for every cause, with the gap in age-standardized mortality rates between counties in the 90th and 10th percentiles varying from 14.0 deaths per 100 000 population (cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases) to 147.0 deaths per 100 000 population (cardiovascular diseases). Geographic regions with elevated mortality rates differed among causes: for example, cardiovascular disease mortality tended to be highest along the southern half of the Mississippi River, while mortality rates from self-harm and interpersonal violence were elevated in southwestern counties, and mortality rates from chronic respiratory disease were highest in counties in eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia. Counties also varied widely in terms of the change in cause-specific mortality rates between 1980 and 2014.

There were significant differences between the results which may partly relate to small-scale spatial and temporal patchiness in the turbidity field. Owen Tubes generally give settling velocities an order of magnitude smaller than the direct video measurements, which may indicate that the tubes disrupt flocs on sampling. Between Owen Tubes different methods of calculating the results may lead to different median settling velocities, especially at low concentrations. However, a well-controlled sampling protocol with the settling tubes gave consistent results. The direct video methods appear to give comparable results, and need to be evaluated further.},

We report sinking particle characteristics determined from image analysis of thousands of individual particles collected in viscous polyacrylamide gels placed in free-drifting sediment traps at two sites: a high phytoplankton biomass site over the central plateau (A3) and a moderate biomass site at its periphery (C5). The particles were divided into three types (1) oval fecal pellets, (2) cylindrical fecal pellets, and (3) aggregates. The aggregates were most abundant and mainly consisted of agglomerations of the cylindrical fecal pellets. Conversion of the pellet and aggregate volumes to carbon contents suggests export fluxes of 50-60 mg C m−2 d−2 at 100-m depth, in reasonable agreement with independent estimates from carbon and 234Th measurements. Our observation that the majority of the particle flux was processed through the heterotrophic foodweb contrasts with the results of artificial iron-fertilization experiments and with models for export from productive diatomdominated waters that emphasize direct export of phytoplankton detritus. The KEOPS results may offer more appropriate scaling for the response of ecosystem structure and carbon export to persistent iron fertilization in the Southern Ocean.},

  abstract = {The rise of grazing resistant planktonic bacteria in freshwater lakes during vernal phytoplankton blooms is favoured by predation of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF). The spring period is also characterized by increased availability of organic carbon species that are in parts derived from cellular debris generated during bacterivory or viral lysis, such as peptidoglycan, chitin and their subunit N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). We tested the hypothesis that two dominant grazing resistant bacterial taxa, the ac1 tribe of Actinobacteria (ac1) and filamentous bacteria from the LD2 lineage (Saprospiraceae), profit from such carbon sources during periods of intense HNF predation. The abundances of ac1 and LD2 rose in parallel with HNF, and disproportionally high fractions of cells from both lineages were involved in NAG uptake. Members of ac1 and LD2 were significantly more enriched after NAG addition to lake water. However, highest growth rates of both bacterial lineages were found on chitin and peptidoglycan. Moreover, the direct or indirect transfer of organic carbon from peptidoglycan to LD2 filaments could be demonstrated. We thus provide evidence that these taxa may benefit twofold from protistan predation: by removal of their competitors, and by specific physiological adaptations to utilize carbon sources that are released during grazing or viral lysis.},

Once oxygen becomes depleted in the system, microbial communities use energetically favourable alternative electron acceptors for respiration. The extent to which changes in respiration are reflected in community gene expression have only recently been investigated. Metatranscriptomes prepared from near-bottom water plankton over a 4-month time series in central Chesapeake Bay demonstrated changes consistent with terminal electron acceptor availability. The frequency of respiration-related genes in metatranscriptomes was examined by BLASTx against curated databases of genes intimately and exclusively involved in specific electron acceptor utilization pathways. The relative expression of genes involved in denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium were coincident with changes in nitrate, nitrite and ammonium concentrations. Dissimilatory iron and manganese reduction transcript ratios increase during anoxic conditions and corresponded with the highest soluble reactive phosphate and manganese concentrations. The sulfide concentration peaked in late July and early August and also matched dissimilatory sulfate reduction transcript ratios. We show that rather than abrupt transitions between terminal electron acceptors, there is substantial overlap in time and space of these various anaerobic respiratory processes in Chesapeake Bay.},

Clear seasonal succession of the bacterioplankton community was observed. After binning of sequences into previously described and highly resolved phylogenetic groups (tribes), their temporal dynamics revealed extensive synchrony and associations with seasonal events such as ice coverage, ice-off, mixing and phytoplankton blooms. Coupling between closely and distantly related tribes was resolved by time-dependent rank correlations, suggesting ecological coherence that was often dependent on taxonomic relatedness. Association networks with the abundant freshwater Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria in focus revealed complex interdependencies within bacterioplankton communities and contrasting linkages to environmental conditions. Accordingly, unique ecological features can be inferred for each tribe and reveal the natural history of abundant cultured and uncultured freshwater bacteria.},

  abstract = {Structured Abstract Background Economic science has evolved over several decades toward greater emphasis on empirical work. The data revolution of the past decade is likely to have a further and profound effect on economic research. Increasingly, economists make use of newly available large-scale administrative data or private sector data that often are obtained through collaborations with private firms, giving rise to new opportunities and challenges. {$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://science-sciencemag-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/346/6210/1243089/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{$>$}The rising use of non–publicly available data in economic research. Here we show the percentage of papers published in the American Economic Review (AER) that obtained an exemption from the AER’s data availability policy, as a share of all papers published by the AER that relied on any form of data (excluding simulations and laboratory experiments). Notes and comments, as well as AER Papers and Proceedings issues, are not included in the analysis. We obtained a record of exemptions directly from the AER administrative staff and coded each exemption manually to reflect public sector versus private data. Our check of nonexempt papers suggests that the AER records may possibly understate the percentage of papers that actually obtained exemptions. The asterisk indicates that data run from when the AER started collecting these data (December 2005 issue) to the September 2014 issue. To make full use of the data, we define year 2006 to cover October 2005 through September 2006, year 2007 to cover October 2006 through September 2007, and so on. Advances These new data are affecting economic research along several dimensions. Many fields have shifted from a reliance on relatively small-sample government surveys to administrative data with universal or near-universal population coverage. This shift is transformative, as it allows researchers to rigorously examine variation in wages, health, productivity, education, and other measures across different subpopulations; construct consistent long-run statistical indices; generate new quasi-experimental research designs; and track diverse outcomes from natural and controlled experiments. Perhaps even more notable is the expansion of private sector data on economic activity. These data, sometimes available from public sources but other times obtained through data-sharing agreements with private firms, can help to create more granular and real-time measurement of aggregate economic statistics. The data also offer researchers a look inside the “black box” of firms and markets by providing meaningful statistics on economic behavior such as search and information gathering, communication, decision-making, and microlevel transactions. Collaborations with data-oriented firms also create new opportunities to conduct and evaluate randomized experiments. Economic theory plays an important role in the analysis of large data sets with complex structure. It can be difficult to organize and study this type of data (or even to decide which variables to construct) without a simplifying conceptual framework, which is where economic models become useful. Better data also allow for sharper tests of existing models and tests of theories that had previously been difficult to assess. Outlook The advent of big data is already allowing for better measurement of economic effects and outcomes and is enabling novel research designs across a range of topics. Over time, these data are likely to affect the types of questions economists pose, by allowing for more focus on population variation and the analysis of a broader range of economic activities and interactions. We also expect economists to increasingly adopt the large-data statistical methods that have been developed in neighboring fields and that often may complement traditional econometric techniques. These data opportunities also raise some important challenges. Perhaps the primary one is developing methods for researchers to access and explore data in ways that respect privacy and confidentiality concerns. This is a major issue in working with both government administrative data and private sector firms. Other challenges include developing the appropriate data management and programming capabilities, as well as designing creative and scalable approaches to summarize, describe, and analyze large-scale and relatively unstructured data sets. These challenges notwithstanding, the next few decades are likely to be a very exciting time for economic research. The quality and quantity of data on economic activity are expanding rapidly. Empirical research increasingly relies on newly available large-scale administrative data or private sector data that often is obtained through collaboration with private firms. Here we highlight some challenges in accessing and using these new data. We also discuss how new data sets may change the statistical methods used by economists and the types of questions posed in empirical research.},

The sources of suspended matter in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and the sea are discussed in Chapter 2, which includes the supply of detrital particles as well as the formation of new particles in the water (organic matter, carbonate, opal). The concentration distribution of suspended matter in rivers, lakes, estuaries, tidal is discussed in Chapter 3, to which is areas, lagoons, and in the sea added a discussion on the sampling of suspended matter and on methods to determine its concentration. Particle composition is treated in Chapter 4, to which is added a section (4. 6) on the compositional analysis of suspended particles. Also included is a discussion on particle surface characteristics and the adsorption of elements and compounds onto particles.},

STR genotyping is performed using electrophoresis where DNA strands with different fluorescence labeling dyes are separated according to their length. Shorter strands arrive earlier at the detector where the attached dyes are excited by an induced laser. The resulting excitation is collected using a multichannel detector, with each channel tuned to detect the strength of a certain labeling dye, utilizing photomultiplier tubes or CCD devices. The spectrum overlap of the dyes causes a detector tuned to the wavelength of a specific dye to also detect with different sensitivity other dyes. In this work we propose a new numerical based algorithm for correcting cross talk resulting from such spectrum overlap. We discuss reasons earlier solutions to a similar problem can not be applied in the genotyping setting. We test our proposed algorithm and report preliminary results showing the success of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {During 2006 and 2007, we documented the re-emergence of severe episodes of vibriosis caused by Vibrio tubiashii in shellfish hatcheries on the west coast of North America. Lost larval and juvenile production included 3 previously undescribed hosts, Pacific (Crassostrea gigas) and Kumamoto (C. sikamea) oysters and geoduck clams Panope abrupta, with a 2007 decline in larval oyster production of \textasciitilde 59\% in one hatchery. Losses of larval and juvenile bivalves were linked to V. tubiashii blooms in the coastal environment, which were associated with the apparent mixing of unusually warm surface seawater and intermittently upwelled cooler, nutrient- and Vibrio spp.-enriched seawater. The ocean temperature elevation anomaly in 2007 was not clearly linked to an El Niño event, as was a similar episode in 1998. Concentrations of the dominant shellfish-pathogenic vibrios were as high as 1.6 × 105 cfu ml–1 in the cold, upwelled water. The bacteria possessed the genes coding for a protease and hemolysin described for V. tubiashii, and pathogenic isolates secreted these peptides. Lesions resulting from a classic invasive disease and a toxigenic noninvasive disease occurred in oyster and geoduck clam larvae. Management and prevention require reduction of incoming concentrations of the bacteria, reduction of contamination in water and air supplies and in stock chemical solutions, removal of bacterial toxins, and interruption of the cycle of bacterial amplification in the hatchery and in microalgal food supplies.},

  abstract = {Ocean acidification from anthropogenic CO2 has focused our attention on the importance of understanding the rates and mechanisms of CaCO3 formation so that changes can be monitored and feedbacks predicted. We present a method for determining the rate of CaCO3 production using in situ measureme nts of fCO2 and pH in surface waters of the eastern subarctic Pacific Ocean. These quantities were determined on a surface mooring every 3 h for a period of about 9 months in 2007 at Ocean Station Papa (50°N, 145°W). We use the data in a simple surface ocean, mass balance model of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity (Alk) to constrain the CaCO3: organic carbon (OC) production ratio to be approximately 0.5. A CaCO3 production rate of 8 mmol CaCO3 m−2 d−1 in the summer of 2007 (1.2 mol m−2 yr−1) is derived by combining the CaCO3: OC ratio with the a net organic carbon production rate (2.5 mol C m−2 yr−1) determined from in situ measurements of oxygen and nitrogen gas concentrations measured on the same mooring (Emerson and Stump, 2010). Carbonate chemistry data from a meridional hydrographic section in this area in 2008 indicate that isopycnal surfaces that outcrop in the winter in the subarctic Pacific and deepen southward into the subtropics are a much stronger source for alkalinity than vertical mixing. This pathway has a high enough Alk:DIC ratio to support the CaCO3:OC production rate implied by the fCO2 and pH data.},

The presence of such waves may account for the prior observation of botton currents as great as 18 cm/sec, of suspended sediment near the basin floors, of a virtual absence of gradients of oxygen and nutrients near the bottom, of locally coarser sediments at basin sills than at their bottoms, and of replacement of basin water so rapidly that oxygen does not become deficient nor do regenerated nutrients become abnormally concentrated in the basin waters.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton blooms in surface waters of the oceans are known to influence the food web and impact microbial as well as zooplankton communities. Numerous studies have investigated the fate of phytoplankton-derived organic matter in surface waters and shelf sediments, however, little is known about the effect of sinking algal biomass on microbial communities in deep-sea sediments. Here, we analyzed sediments of four regions in the Southern Atlantic Ocean along the Antarctic Polar Front that had different exposures to phytoplankton bloom derived organic matter. We investigated the microbial communities in these sediments using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA molecules to determine microorganisms that were active and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization to infer their abundance and distribution. The sediments along the Antarctic Polar Front harbored microbial communities that were highly diverse and contained microbial clades that seem to preferably occur in regions of high primary productivity. We showed that organisms affiliated with the gammaproteobacterial clade NOR5/OM60, which is known from surface waters and coastal sediments, thrive in the deepsea. Benthic deep-sea NOR5 were abundant, diverse, distinct from pelagic NOR5 and likely specialized on the degradation of phytoplankton-derived organic matter, occupying a similar niche as their pelagic relatives. Algal detritus seemed to not only fuel the benthic microbial communities of large areas in the deep-sea, but also to influence communities locally, as we found a peak in Flavobacteriaceae-related clades that also include degraders of algal biomass. The results strongly suggest that phytoplanktonderived organic matter was rapidly exported to the deep-sea, nourished distinct benthic microbial communities and seemed to be the main energy source for microbial life in the seafloor of vast abyssal regions along the Antarctic Polar Front.},

  abstract = {The quantitative relationship between organic carbon and mineral contents of particles sinking below 1800 m in the ocean indicates that organisms with mineral shells such as coccolithophores are of special importance for transporting carbon into the deep sea. Several hypotheses about the mechanism behind this relationship between minerals and organic matter have been raised, such as mineral protection of organic matter or enhanced sinking rates through ballast addition. We examined organic matter decomposition of calcifying and non-calcifying Emiliania huxleyi cultures in an experiment that allowed aggregation and settling in rotating tanks. Biogenic components such as particulate carbon, particulate nitrogen, particulate volume, pigments, transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), and particulate amino acids in suspended particles and aggregates were followed over a period of 30 d. The overall pattern of decrease in organic matter, the amount of recalcitrant organic matter left after 30 d, and the compositional changes within particulate organic matter indicated that cells without a shell are more subject to loss than calcified cells. It is suggested that biogenic calcite helps in the preservation of particulate organic matter (POM) by offering structural support for organic molecules. Over the course of the experiment, half the particulate organic carbon in both calcifying and non-calcifying cultures was partitioned into aggregates and remained so until the end of the experiment. The partial protection of particulate organic matter from solubilization by biominerals and by aggregation that was observed in our experiment may help explain the robustness of the relationship between organic and mineral matter fluxes in the deep ocean.},

  abstract = {Ecological research in recent decades revealed that species loss has a predominantly negative effect on ecosystem functioning and stability. Most of these studies were based on random species loss scenarios, but extinctions in nature are not random. Recent experimental studies using macroscopic communities largely advanced knowledge about the effects of non-random species loss. However, in microscopic communities like the phytoplankton, implementing realistic species loss scenarios is challenging and experimental data are scarce. Creating more realistic experiments to study the role of phytoplankton diversity for ecosystem functioning is particularly important, as they provide up to 50\% of global primary productivity, form the basis of all pelagic food webs, and are important for biogeochemical cycling. In this study, we experimentally tested and evaluated three methods for non-random species loss in a natural marine phytoplankton community. Dilution, filtration, and heat stress removed the targeted rare, large, and sensitive species, respectively. All these species groups are extremely vulnerable to extinction in future climate scenarios and play important roles in the communities. Dilution and filtration with a fine mesh additionally decreased initial biomass, which increased the variability of species left in the respective replicates. The methods tested in this study can be used to non-randomly manipulate phytoplankton species diversity in communities used for experiments. However, in studies where species identities are more important than species richness, the dilution and filtration methods should be modified to eliminate the effect of decreasing initial biomass.},

  abstract = {Understanding the principles that govern the assembly~of microbial communities across earth’s biomes is a major challenge in modern microbial ecology. This pursuit is complicated by the difficulties of mapping functional roles and interactions onto communities with immense taxonomic diversity and of identifying the scale at which microbes interact [1]. To address this challenge, here, we focused on the bacterial communities that colonize and degrade particulate organic matter in the ocean [2, 3, 4]. We show that the assembly of these communities can be simplified as a linear combination of functional modules. Using synthetic polysaccharide particles immersed in natural bacterioplankton assemblages~[1, 5], we showed that successional particle colonization dynamics are driven by the interaction of two types of modules: a first type made of narrowly specialized primary degraders, whose dynamics are controlled by particle polysaccharide composition, and a second type containing substrate-independent taxa whose dynamics are controlled by interspecific interactions—in particular, cross-feeding via organic acids, amino acids, and other metabolic byproducts. We show that, as a consequence of this trophic structure, communities can assemble modularly—i.e., by a simple sum of substrate-specific primary degrader modules, one for each complex polysaccharide in the~particle, connected to a single broad-niche range consumer module. Consistent with this model, a linear combination of the communities on single-polysaccharide particles accurately predicts community composition on mixed-polysaccharide particles. Our results suggest that the assembly of heterotrophic communities that degrade complex organic materials follows simple design principles that could be exploited to engineer heterotrophic microbiomes.},

Marked fluctuations were observed in the date of many of the physicochemical parameters and the indicator bacteria. The higher-salinity water and coarser sediment of the inlet site showed lower overall bacterial densities than did the headwater sites, where freshwater runoff and decreased tidal action were characteristic. Densities of benthic indicator bacteria, when expressed on a volumetric basis, were significantly greater than counts in the overlying waters. These counts were indicative of a fecally polluted system and were well above the safe maximum limits for shellfish-growing waters. Significantly fewer total and fecal bacteria were observed in both the water and the sediment during the warm months of May, July, and August. The primary sources of the Lynnhaven's bacterial pollution appeared to be typical of urban and agricultural runoff, although failure of septic tank systems was suspected as a problem in the Lynnhaven's western branch. These results illustrated that sediments in shellfishing areas could serve as a reservoir for high densities of indicator bacteria and that, potentially, pathogens could pose a health hazard.},

For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

Much evidence for this was obtained in the late 1960s and early 1970s, using the 14C-tracer technique introduced by Parsons and Strickland (1962). This technique enables the uptake of selected organic substrates by natural communities to be studied under in situ conditions. It could be shown that organisms smaller than 1–3 µ,m did indeed assimilate the largest fraction of these dissolved organic substrates when added to seawater samples in concentrations of a few micrograms per liter. As the information provided by the Parsons and Strickland technique is restricted to the fate of the selected substrates, several other methods for the determination of bacterial activity have been developed, giving more direct information on the dynamics of bacterial communities.},

The aim of this review is to take the reader along the timeline and major milestones that led us to modern metagenomics. This new and thriving area is likely to be an important contributor to solve different problems. The transition from classical microbiology to modern metagenomics studies has required the development of new branches of knowledge and specialization. Here, we will review how the availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies has transformed microbiology and bioinformatics and how to tackle the inherent computational challenges that arise from the DNA sequencing revolution. New computational methods are constantly developed to collect, process, and extract useful biological information from a variety of samples and complex datasets, but metagenomics needs the integration of several of these computational methods. Despite the level of specialization needed in bioinformatics, it is important that life-scientists have a good understanding of it for a correct experimental design, which allows them to reveal the information in a metagenome.},

  abstract = {Plankton populations in Prince William Sound, Alaska, exhibited pronounced seasonal, annual and longer-period variability in composition and standing stock in response to physically influenced differences in nutrient availability, and possibly currents that modify local biomass by exchanges with water from the bordering Gulf of Alaska. During springs in which early, strong physical stratification developed, intense, short-lived phytoplankton blooms occurred. These blooms had relatively short residence times in the water column. In contrast, during springs in which slower, weaker stratification developed, phytoplankton blooms were prolonged and took longer to peak. These slower blooms prolonged the period of phytoplankton production, prolonged interaction with the springtime grazing community and led to the incorporation of more organic matter into pelagic food webs. A coupled biological-physical simulation of plankton production was used to examine the implications of seasonally varying air and mixed-layer temperatures, surface winds and incident light on the timing, duration, annual production and standing stock of plankton. Our modelling results reproduced the observed characteristics of the springtime production cycle, and the magnitude of zooplankton stocks for the period 1992-97 but not for 1981-91. These results suggest that for most of the 1990s, bottom-up influences on nutrient supplies controlled levels of primary consumers, whereas for the 11 years before that, other unknown factors dominated this process. We present the results of a comprehensive, multiyear study of relationships between plankton and physical limitations, and a retrospective analysis of earlier conditions to explore the possible causes for these differences.},

Using Kurt Lewin’s planned approach to change, the committee describes five recommendations to increase URM persistence in STEM at the undergraduate level. These recommendations capitalize on known successes, recognize the need for accountability, and are framed to facilitate greater progress in the future.

All dogs vomited, and lethargy, anorexia, and diarrhea were other common clinical signs. Decreased urine output, ataxia, or weakness were associated with a negative outcome. High calcium × phosphorus product (Ca × P), hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalcemia were present in 95\%, 90\%, and 62\% of the dogs in which these variables were evaluated. Extremely high initial total calcium concentration, peak total calcium concentration, initial Ca × P, and peak Ca × P were negative prognostic indicators. Proximal renal tubular necrosis was the most consistent finding in dogs for which histopathology was evaluated. Fifty-three percent of the 43 dogs survived, with 15 of these 23 having a complete resolution of clinical signs and azotemia.

One area of current and predicted future change is the sub-Antarctic zone (SAZ) to the southeast of Tasmania, Australia, where a southward shift in westerly winds appears to be forcing warmer and macronutrient-poor subtropical waters into the sub-Antarctic zone (SAZ). We investigated the impact of these subtropical waters on the microbial community of the SAZ on the SAZ-Sense cruise during the austral summer of 2007. The abundance of pico- and nanoeukaryotic algae, cyanobacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, bacteria and viruses was determined by flow cytometry at stations in the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), the SAZ and in Subtropical Zone (STZ). Using cluster and similarity profile analyses on integrated microbial abundances over the top 200 m, we found that microbial communities located in the potential future SAZ to the southeast of Tasmania formed two distinct groups from those of the remainder of the SAZ and the PFZ. In the waters of the potential future SAZ, shallow mixed layers and increased iron concentrations elevated cyanobacterial, bacterial and viral abundances and increased percentage high DNA bacteria, resulting in communities similar to those of subtropical waters. Conversely, waters of the PFZ exhibited relatively low concentrations of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes and viruses, indicative of the iron limitation in this region. A Distance Based Linear Model determined that salinity and nitrogen availability (nitrate, nitrite and ammonia concentrations) were the most influential environmental parameters over the survey, explaining 72\% of the variation in microbial community structure. The microbial community of the potential future SAZ showed a shift away from particulate carbon export from the photic zone towards increased production by smaller cells, increased significance of the microbial loop and viral lysis. These changes would promote carbon recycling within the photic zone, thereby potentially decreasing the capacity of the future SAZ to absorb CO(2). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Oceanic oxygen deficient zones (ODZs) influence global biogeochemical cycles in a variety of ways, most notably by acting as a sink for fixed nitrogen (Codispoti et al. 2001). Optimum multiparameter analysis of data from two cruises in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) was implemented to develop a water mass analysis for the large ODZ in this region. This analysis reveals that the most pronounced oxygen deficient conditions are within the 13°C water (13CW) mass, which is distributed via subsurface mesoscale features such as eddies branching from the California Undercurrent. Nitrite accumulates within these eddies and slightly below the core of the 13CW. This water mass analysis also reveals that the 13CW and deeper Northern Equatorial Pacific Intermediate Water (NEPIW) act as the two Pacific Equatorial source waters to the California Current System. The Equatorial Subsurface Water and Subtropical Subsurface Water are synonymous with the 13CW and this study refers to this water mass as the 13CW based on its history. Since the 13CW has been found to dominate the most pronounced oxygen deficient conditions within the Eastern Tropical South Pacific ODZ and the Peru-Chile Undercurrent, the 13CW and the NEPIW define boundaries for oxygen minimum conditions across the entire eastern Pacific Ocean.},

In order to characterize microbial dynamics, we performed measurements of bacterial biomass (BB) and production (BP) and phytoplankton pigment analyses in two upwelling eddies in the Sargasso Sea sampled in 2004 and 2005. We also observed a 3-fold increase in BP at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site during the passage of a cyclonic eddy in 2003. Although the integrated BB and BP over 140 m in 2004 and 2005 eddies remained within the climatological range measured at the BATS site, there was systematic variability in bacterioplankton dynamics across both eddies. Cyclonic eddy C1 demonstrated decreased BP at the feature's center relative to its periphery, and BP was not correlated with total chlorophyll a (TChl a) variability. However, BP correlated with prymnesiophyte pigments throughout the feature. In contrast, mode-water eddy A4 showed an enhancement in BP at the eddy center (EC) relative to its edges and was coincident with elevated TChl a, high primary production measurements, and a high concentration of diatoms. In eddy A4, the tight relationship between enhanced BP, TChl a and specific phytoplankton taxa implies that the phytoplankton community structure was an important factor influencing BP variability. While the heterotrophic bacterial response in C1 and A4 was not enhanced relative to BATS summer climatology, these data and the presence of similar nutrient fields across both eddies suggest that BP and BB were influenced by the eddy perturbations and responded to changes in the phytoplankton community.},

  abstract = {Many complex systems are organized in the form of a network embedded in space. Important examples include the physical Internet infrastucture, road networks, flight connections, brain functional networks, and social networks. The effect of space on network topology has recently come under the spotlight because of the emergence of pervasive technologies based on geolocalization, which constantly fill databases with people’s movements and thus reveal their trajectories and spatial behavior. Extracting patterns and regularities from the resulting massive amount of human mobility data requires the development of appropriate tools for uncovering information in spatially embedded networks. In contrast with most works that tend to apply standard network metrics to any type of network, we argue in this paper for a careful treatment of the constraints imposed by space on network topology. In particular, we focus on the problem of community detection and propose a modularity function adapted to spatial networks. We show that it is possible to factor out the effect of space in order to reveal more clearly hidden structural similarities between the nodes. Methods are tested on a large mobile phone network and computer-generated benchmarks where the effect of space has been incorporated.},

  abstract = {Changes in oceanic primary production, linked to changes in the network of global biogeochemical cycles, have profoundly influenced the geochemistry of Earth for over 3 billion years. In the contemporary ocean, photosynthetic carbon fixation by marine phytoplankton leads to formation of ∼45 gigatons of organic carbon per annum, of which 16 gigatons are exported to the ocean interior. Changes in the magnitude of total and export production can strongly influence atmospheric CO2 levels (and hence climate) on geological time scales, as well as set upper bounds for sustainable fisheries harvest. The two fluxes are critically dependent on geophysical processes that determine mixed-layer depth, nutrient fluxes to and within the ocean, and food-web structure. Because the average turnover time of phytoplankton carbon in the ocean is on the order of a week or less, total and export production are extremely sensitive to external forcing and consequently are seldom in steady state. Elucidating the biogeochemical controls and feedbacks on primary production is essential to understanding how oceanic biota responded to and affected natural climatic variability in the geological past, and will respond to anthropogenically influenced changes in coming decades. One of the most crucial feedbacks results from changes in radiative forcing on the hydrological cycle, which influences the aeolian iron flux and, in turn, affects nitrogen fixation and primary production in the oceans.},

  abstract = {The deep ocean piezosphere accounts for a significant part of the global ocean, hosts active and diverse microbial communities which probably play a more important role than hitherto recognized in the global ocean carbon cycle. The conventional biological pump concept and the recently proposed microbial carbon pump mechanism provide a foundation for our understanding of the role of microorganisms in cycling of carbon in the ocean. However, there are significant gaps in our knowledge and a lack of mechanistic understanding of the processes of microbially-mediated production, transformation, degradation, and export of marine dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM) in the deep ocean and the ecological consequence. Here we propose the POM-DOM piezophilic microorganism continuum (PDPMC) conceptual model, to address these important biogeochemical processes in the deep ocean. We propose that piezophilic microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) play a pivotal role in deep ocean carbon cycle where microbial production of exoenzymes, enzymatic breakdown of DOM and transformation of POM fuels the rapid cycling of marine organic matter, and serve as the primary driver for carbon cycle in the deep ocean.},

  abstract = {Competition over limited water resources is one of the main concerns for the coming decades. Although water issues alone have not been the sole trigger for warfare in the past, tensions over freshwater management and use represent one of the main concerns in political relations between riparian states and may exacerbate existing tensions, increase regional instability and social unrest. Previous studies made great efforts to understand how international water management problems were addressed by actors in a more cooperative or confrontational way. In this study, we analyze what are the pre-conditions favoring the insurgence of water management issues in shared water bodies, rather than focusing on the way water issues are then managed among actors. We do so by proposing an innovative analysis of past episodes of conflict and cooperation over transboundary water resources (jointly defined as “hydro-political interactions”). On the one hand, we aim at highlighting the factors that are more relevant in determining water interactions across political boundaries. On the other hand, our objective is to map and monitor the evolution of the likelihood of experiencing hydro-political interactions over space and time, under changing socioeconomic and biophysical scenarios, through a spatially explicit data driven index. Historical cross-border water interactions were used as indicators of the magnitude of corresponding water joint-management issues. These were correlated with information about river basin freshwater availability, climate stress, human pressure on water resources, socioeconomic conditions (including institutional development and power imbalances), and topographic characteristics. This analysis allows for identification of the main factors that determine water interactions, such as water availability, population density, power imbalances, and climatic stressors. The proposed model was used to map at high spatial resolution the probability of experiencing hydro-political interactions worldwide. This baseline outline is then compared to four distinct climate and population density projections aimed to estimate trends for hydro-political interactions under future conditions (2050 and 2100), while considering two greenhouse gases emission scenarios (moderate and extreme climate change). The combination of climate and population growth dynamics is expected to impact negatively on the overall hydro-political risk by increasing the likelihood of water interactions in the transboundary river basins, with an average increase ranging between 74.9\% (2050 – population and moderate climate change) to 95\% (2100 - population and extreme climate change). Future demographic and climatic conditions are expected to exert particular pressure on already water stressed basins such as the Nile, the Ganges/Brahmaputra, the Indus, the Tigris/Euphrates, and the Colorado. The results of this work allow us to identify current and future areas where water issues are more likely to arise, and where cooperation over water should be actively pursued to avoid possible tensions especially under changing environmental conditions. From a policy perspective, the index presented in this study can be used to provide a sound quantitative basis to the assessment of the Sustainable Development Goal 6, Target 6.5 “Water resources management”, and in particular to indicator 6.5.2 “Transboundary cooperation”.},

  abstract = {Enteric viruses represent a global public health threat and are implicated in numerous foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks. Nonetheless, relatively little is known of their fate and stability in the environment. In this study we used carefully validated methods to monitor enteric viruses, namely adenovirus (AdV), JC polyomavirus (JCV), noroviruses (NoVs), sapovirus (SaV) and hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV and HEV) from wastewater source to beaches and shellfish beds. Wastewater influent and effluent, surface water, sediment and shellfish samples were collected in the Conwy catchment (North Wales, UK) once a month for one year. High concentrations of AdV and JCV were found in the majority of samples, and no seasonal patterns were observed. No HAV and HEV were detected and no related illnesses were reported in the area during the period of sampling. Noroviruses and SaV were also detected at high concentrations in wastewater and surface water, and their presence correlated with local gastroenteritis outbreaks during the spring and autumn seasons. Noroviruses were also found in estuarine sediment and in shellfish harvested for human consumption. As PCR-based methods were used for quantification, viral infectivity and degradation was estimated using a NoV capsid integrity assay. The assay revealed low-levels of viral decay in wastewater effluent compared to influent, and more significant decay in environmental waters and sediment. Results suggest that AdV and JCV may be suitable markers for the assessment of the spatial distribution of wastewater contamination in the environment; and pathogenic viruses can be directly monitored during and after reported outbreaks to prevent further environment-derived illnesses.},

  abstract = {Sinking particles transport carbon and nutrients from the surface ocean into the deep sea and are considered hot spots for bacterial diversity and activity. In the oligotrophic oceans, nitrogen (N2)-fixing organisms (diazotrophs) are an important source of new N but the extent to which these organisms are present and exported on sinking particles is not well known. Sinking particles were collected every 6\,h over a 2-day period using net traps deployed at 150\,m in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The bacterial community and composition of diazotrophs associated with individual and bulk sinking particles was assessed using 16S rRNA and nifH gene amplicon sequencing. The bacterial community composition in bulk particles remained remarkably consistent throughout time and space while large variations of individually picked particles were observed. This difference suggests that unique biogeochemical conditions within individual particles may offer distinct ecological niches for specialized bacterial taxa. Compared to surrounding seawater, particle samples were enriched in different size classes of globally significant N2-fixing cyanobacteria including Trichodesmium, symbionts of diatoms, and the unicellular cyanobacteria Crocosphaera and UCYN-A. The particles also contained nifH gene sequences of diverse non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs suggesting that particles could be loci for N2 fixation by heterotrophic bacteria. The results demonstrate that diverse diazotrophs were present on particles and that new N may thereby be directly exported from surface waters on sinking particles.},

Dry mass and dry density are obtained simultaneously by measuring a cell’s buoyant mass sequentially in an H2O-based fluid and a D2O-based fluid. Rapid exchange of intracellular H2O for D2O renders the cell’s water content neutrally buoyant in both measurements, and thus the paired measurements yield the mass and density of the cell’s dry material alone. Utilizing this same property of rapid water exchange, we also demonstrate the quantification of intracellular water mass. In a population of E. coli, we paired these measurements to estimate the percent dry weight by mass and volume. We then focused on cellular dry density – the average density of all cellular biomolecules, weighted by their relative abundances. Given that densities vary across biomolecule types (RNA, DNA, protein), we investigated whether we could detect changes in biomolecular composition in bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. In E. coli, and S. cerevisiae, dry density increases from stationary to exponential phase, consistent with previously known increases in the RNA/protein ratio from up-regulated ribosome production. For mammalian cells, changes in growth conditions cause substantial shifts in dry density, suggesting concurrent changes in the protein, nucleic acid and lipid content of the cell.},

After presenting a generic overview of the first-order processes, we review system-specific characteristics for selected estuaries where adjacent human settlements contribute to high nutrient loads, river-dominated shelves that receive large inputs of fresh water and anthropogenic nutrients, and upwelling regions where a supply of nutrient-rich, low-oxygen waters generates oxygen minimum zones without direct anthropogenic influence. We propose a nondimensional number that relates the hypoxia timescale and water residence time to guide the cross-system comparison.

  abstract = {Strain-to-strain variations in bacterial biofilm formation, metabolism, motility, virulence, evolvability, DNA repair and resistance (to phage, antibiotics, or environmental stresses) each contribute to bacterial diversity. Microbiologists should be aware that all of these traits are subject to constraints imposed by trade-offs, so adaptations improving one trait may be at the cost of another. A deeper appreciation of trade-offs is thus crucial for assessing the mechanistic limits on important bacterial characteristics. Studies of the negative correlations between various traits have revealed three molecular mechanisms, namely, trade-offs involving resource allocation, design constraint, and information processing. This review further discusses why these trade-off mechanisms are important in the establishment of models capable of predicting bacterial competition, coexistence, and sources of diversity.},

  abstract = {* 1There is a clear need to improve our ability to assess the ecological consequences of environmental change. Because of the complexity of ecosystems and a need to disentangle the effects of multiple pressures, predictions are often reliant on models and expert opinion. These require validation with observed data; in this respect, long-term data sets are particularly valuable. * 2Innovative statistical methods (nonparametric regression and additive models) are presented for identifying nonparametric ecological trends and changes in seasonality in response to environmental change. These are illustrated through the example of Loch Leven, a shallow freshwater lake. Monitoring data for 35~years are examined, spanning periods of enrichment, ecological recovery and changing climate. * 3Models are developed for phosphorus and nitrogen; temperature and rainfall; Daphnia grazers; and chlorophyll~a, with the ecological objectives of examining trends in water quality and the corresponding trends in nutrient availability, grazer abundance and climate. * 4The analysis highlighted a generally decreasing availability of P over the study period, and generally increasing nonparametric trends in nitrate concentration and rainfall. Increasing spring temperatures were also evident, as were significant nonparametric changes in density of summer grazers. * 5Significant reductions are highlighted in spring and summer chlorophyll~a, related to the return of Daphnia to the loch. However, no response in chorophyll~a to the later declining trends in P is apparent, but seasonality has changed. * 6Synthesis and applications. The analysis highlights the value of nonparametric statistical models for assessing complex ecological responses to environmental change. The models outlined can examine key ecological impacts of climate change, particularly effects on the timing of seasonal events and processes. The models are illustrated using long-term water-quality data from Loch Leven to explore patterns in key environmental drivers and ecological responses affecting freshwater ecosystems. Analysis of chlorophyll~a, in particular, highlighted the value of examining the seasonal trends separately, with different trends evident for winter and spring and a changing seasonal pattern.},

  abstract = {In the western equatorial Atlantic, 5 years of satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) measurements (1998-2002) from the cloud penetrating Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager reveal SST signatures of rings shedding from the North Brazil Current (NBC) as it separates from the South American coastline north of the Amazon River Delta and retroflects eastward between 5 and 10degreesN. By removing the spatial-mean SST from a 7degrees by 7degrees square of the nearly instantaneous measurements of each satellite pass, the 46.7 day aliasing period of the diurnal solar cycle is reduced, and seven to eight rings are observed per year with relatively warm (cold) SST anomalies of up to 1 degreesC in the first (second) half of the year. The sense of the SST anomalies carried by the NBC rings are determined by the contrast between the NBC SST and the regional SSTs that are influenced by the far-reaching seasonally varying Amazon River freshwater plume. Within a 1.6-year period, 12 of the SST anomalies are validated by in situ mooring array data confirming the predicted sense of the SST anomalies for each season. According to historical hydrographic data, during the first half of the year, the Amazon Plume is generally contained northwest along the coast, whereas during the second half of the year, the Amazon Plume surrounds the NBC retroflection on the west and the north, and from the surface down to 50 m, imposing a dramatic surface salinity contrast up to -4 and a surface temperature contrast up to + 2 degreesC across the front. The surface layer characteristics of the rings shed from the NBC retroflection reveal varying influence of the Amazon Plume. Of the four rings surveyed in the NBCR experiment, Amazon Plume water is found only on the edges of three surface-intensified rings, whereas it completely covers the surface layer of the one thermocline-intensified ring. The maximum current cores of the NBC and retroflection are observed within tens-of-meters of the edges of the Amazon Plume. As the fresher and typically warmer surface waters associated with the Amazon Plume are buoyant relative to the saltier and typically colder surface waters carried by the NBC, the varying position of the Amazon Plume may seasonally influence the surface dynamics in the region.

However, most of these marine phages are uncharacterized because few of their hosts have been cultivated. To learn more about such phages, we designed a set of degenerate PCR primers for phage T4 g23, which encodes the major capsid protein in all of the T4-type phages, an important family of the tailed phage. These primers were used to amplify g23-related sequences from diverse marine environments (fjords and bays of British Columbia, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the western Arctic Ocean) revealing a remarkable level of molecular diversity, which in some cases was correlated with morphological variation of the virions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that although some of these sequences were closely related to well studied subgroups of the T4-type phage, such as the T-evens, the majority of them belong to five previously uncharacterized subgroups. These data indicate that the host range of T4-type phages is much broader than previously imagined and that the laboratory isolate T4 belongs to a phage family that is extraordinarily widespread and diverse in the biosphere.},

All of the inorganic N and between 31\% and 96\% of the EON was removed during biotic bioassays within the first 2 days. Further, there was substantial abiotic reactivity of effluent N when it was added to natural water samples. Results demonstrate that organic and inorganic N in effluent is removed to support the growth of microbial communities. These are the first results aimed at assessing the reactivity of EON in natural waters along an estuarine/salinity gradient.},

This site has a sandy mud bottom and low current velocities, is subjected to episodic sediment resuspension, and was in production for 3 yr prior to this study. We examined both the increase in carbon flux to the benthos caused by the net-pen and the effects of the elevated flux on sediment biogeochemistry and the microbial and macrobenthic communities. The experimental design involved the establishment of two study sites, an ambient site ca. 100 m from the net-pen and a treatment site around the pen. Sediment traps deployed 1 m above the sediment-water interface indicated that carbon flux to the benthos was increased 1-fold to 6-fold (to a maximum of 5 g m(-2) d(-1)) at the edge of the net-pen with little or no increase in carbon flux 10 m from the pen. Unlike carbon flux rates, sediment organic matter inventories showed a complex pattern of change over time. Mineral surface area, organic carbon and nitrogen, digestible protein, and sterol content were initially (April 1991) lower beneath the pen than in ambient sediments. During 1991 ambient sediment accumulated organic matter until July after which it decreased, to a low during November. In contrast, organic matter inventories of sediment beneath the pen remained low until July and then increased to a high during November. These latter gains were associated with the development of bacterial mats at the sediment-water interface. Beneath the pen, microbial and macrofaunal communities were shifted toward those commonly associated with organic enrichment but seasonal trends and storm-related resuspension events also significantly affected these sediment communities. When abundant, most epibenthic organisms were more numerous near the pen than in adjacent ambient areas. These results suggest that net-pen aquaculture can alter the benthic ecosystem in Maine Coastal waters but indicate that the effects are spatially limited.},

  abstract = {An automated method of ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) was developed for the rapid estimation of microbial diversity and community composition in freshwater environments. Following isolation of total community DNA, PCR amplification of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region in the rRNA operon was performed with a fluorescence-labeled forward primer. ARISA-PCR fragments ranging in size from 400 to 1,200 bp were next discriminated and measured by using an automated electrophoresis system. Database information on the 16S-23S intergenic spacer was also examined, to understand the potential biases in diversity estimates provided by ARISA. In the analysis of three natural freshwater bacterial communities, ARISA was rapid and sensitive and provided highly reproducible community-specific profiles at all levels of replication tested. The ARISA profiles of the freshwater communities were quantitatively compared in terms of both their relative diversity and similarity level. The three communities had distinctly different profiles but were similar in their total number of fragments (range, 34 to 41). In addition, the pattern of major amplification products in representative profiles was not significantly altered when the PCR cycle number was reduced from 30 to 15, but the number of minor products (near the limit of detection) was sensitive to changes in cycling parameters. Overall, the results suggest that ARISA is a rapid and effective community analysis technique that can be used in conjunction with more accurate but labor-intensive methods (e.g., 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing) when fine-scale spatial and temporal resolution is needed.},

  abstract = {The biological carbon pump is largely driven by the formation and sinking of marine snow. Because of their high organic matter content, marine snow aggregates are hotspots for microbial activity, and microbial organic matter degradation plays an important role in the attenuation of carbon fluxes to the deep sea. Our inability to examine and characterize microscale distributions of compounds making up the aggregate matrix, and of possible niches inside marine snow, has hindered our understanding of the basic processes governing marine carbon export and sequestration. To address this issue, we have adapted soft-embedding and sectioning to study the spatial structure and components of marine aggregates at high resolution. Soft-embedding enables rapid quantitative sampling of undisturbed marine aggregates from the water column and from sediment traps, followed by spatially resolved staining and characterization of substrates of the aggregate matrix and the microorganisms attached to it. Particular strengths of the method include in situ embedding in sediment traps and successful fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-probe labeling, supporting studies of microbial diversity and ecology. The high spatial resolution achieved by thin-sectioning of soft-embedded aggregates offers the possibility for improved understanding of the composition and structure of marine snow, which directly influence settling velocity, microbial colonization and diversity, degradation rates, and carbon content. Our method will help to elucidate the small-scale processes underlying large-scale carbon cycling in the marine environment, which is especially relevant in the context of rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions and global change.},

  abstract = {According to Connell's intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), diversity within a community is maximal at intermediate frequencies and intensities of disturbances. In order to test the IDH, disturbances of different frequencies and intensities were imposed on natural plankton communities in controlled field experiments. These disturbances consisted of an artificial deepening of the mixed layer, leading to the dilution of epilimnetic populations and to a higher level of nutrients. Intervals between disturbances ranged from 2 to 12 d. Different intensities of disturbance were caused by differences in the experimental mixing depth (150 and 225\% of the original epilimnion depth). Investigation focused on the effect that disturbances had on the diversity of natural phytoplankton communities. Additionally, we were interested in determining the effect of grazing by zooplankton. The results of the field experiments show for the first time the applicability of the IDH to phytoplankton within complete planktonic communities. Diversity showed a clear maximum at the intermediate disturbance interval of 6 d. Similarly, species number peaked at intermediate interval length (6-10 d).},

  abstract = {This review summarizes data on the biogeography and dispersal of bacteria, microfungi and selected protists, such as dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, testate amoebae, and ciliates. Furthermore, it introduces the restricted distribution and dispersal of mosses, ferns and macrofungi as arguments into the discussion on the postulated cosmopolitism and ubiquity of protists. Estimation of diversity and distribution of micro-organisms is greatly disturbed by undersampling, the scarcity of taxonomists, and the frequency of misidentifications. Thus, probably more than 50\% of the actual diversity has not yet been described in many protist groups. Notwithstanding, it has been shown that a restricted geographic distribution of micro-organisms occurs in limnetic, marine, terrestrial, and fossil ecosystems. Similar as, in cryptogams and macrofungi about, 30\% of the extant supragenefic taxa, described and undescribed, might be morphological and/or genetic and/or molecular endemics. At the present state of knowledge, micro-organism endemicity can be proved/disproved mainly by flagship species, excluding sites (e.g., university ponds) prone to be contaminated by invaders. In future, genetic and molecular data will be increasingly helpful. The wide distribution of many micro-organisms has been attributed to their small size and their astronomical numbers. However, this interpretation is flawed by data from macrofungi, mosses and ferns, many of which occupy distinct areas, in spite of their minute and abundant means of dispersal (spores). Thus, I suggest historic events (split of Pangaea etc.), limited cyst viability and, especially, time as major factors for dispersal and provinciality of micro-organisms. Furthermore, the true number of species and their distribution can hardly be estimated by theories and statistics but require reliable investigations on the number of morphospecies in representative ecosystems. Generally, the doubts on Beijerinck's famous metaphor “in micro-organisms everything is everywhere” can be focussed on a simple question: If the world is teeming with cosmopolitan unicells, where is everybody?},

  abstract = {Sinking particles mediate the transport of carbon and energy to the deep-sea, yet the specific microbes associated with sedimenting particles in the ocean’s interior remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we used particle interceptor traps (PITs) to assess the nature of particle-associated microbial communities collected at a variety of depths in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Comparative metagenomics was used to assess differences in microbial taxa and functional gene repertoires in PITs containing a preservative (poisoned traps) compared to preservative-free traps where growth was allowed to continue in situ (live traps). Live trap microbial communities shared taxonomic and functional similarities with bacteria previously reported to be enriched in dissolved organic matter (DOM) microcosms (e.g., Alteromonas and Methylophaga), in addition to other particle and eukaryote-associated bacteria (e.g., Flavobacteriales and Pseudoalteromonas). Poisoned trap microbial assemblages were enriched in Vibrio and Campylobacterales likely associated with eukaryotic surfaces and intestinal tracts as symbionts, pathogens or saprophytes. The functional gene content of microbial assemblages in poisoned traps included a variety of genes involved in virulence, anaerobic metabolism, attachment to chitinaceaous surfaces, and chitin degradation. The presence of chitinaceaous surfaces was also accompanied by the co-existence of bacteria which encoded the capacity to attach to, transport and metabolize chitin and its derivatives. Distinctly different microbial assemblages predominated in live traps, which were largely represented by copiotrophs and eukaryote-associated bacterial communities. These data indicate the central role of eukaryotic taxa in structuring sinking particle microbial assemblages, as well as the rapid responses of indigenous microbial species in the degradation of marine particulate organic matter in situ in the ocean’s interior.},

In these wild bird surveys, the use of real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR has proved to be an invaluable tool as a frontline screening assay for the detection of avian influenza virus (AIV) RNA. However, verification of HPAI diagnosis, particularly in a primary outbreak situation, requires confirmation by a national, community or world reference laboratory. This may necessitate freezing and thawing of samples, sub-sampling and transportation to the reference laboratory. The deleterious effects of such handling on the infectivity of virus and the yield of viral RNA have been observed. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of freezing and thawing, time, sample type and transportation on the yield of AIV RNA. Additionally, the effect of the RNA stabilisation agent, RNAlater was investigated. It was demonstrated that the quality of AIV RNA in faecal homogenate was markedly reduced by freezing and thawing, but that treatment with RNAlater protected the viral RNA from deterioration. When using RNAlater even low titre AIV samples were protected from the detrimental effects of time and transportation conditions.},

The area investigated was a sewage outfall site off the North Head of Sydney Harbour, Australia. The method used multiple regression to relate site sampled parameters to digital Landsat-TM data, and the results verified using data not used in the regression. Multiple correlation coefficients in excess of R=0.9 resulted from the regression analysis, which used Landsat-TM variables in a Chebyshev Series form. However due to the limited number of ocean samples only the results for turbidity were considered significant. Nevertheless a satisfactory methodology is proposed.},

The short-term incorporation of 13C (H13CO3) in phytoplankton and bacterial lipid biomarkers was measured as well as the total bacterial carbon production (BP), viral lysis and the microbial community structure under three experimental conditions: (1) High inorganic Nutrient and High Grazing (HN~+~HG), (2) High inorganic Nutrient and Low Grazing (HN~+~LG) and (3) under natural in situ conditions with Low inorganic Nutrient and High Grazing (LN~+~HG) during spring. Under phytoplankton bloom conditions (HN~+~LG), the bacterial use of freshly produced phytoplankton exudates as a source of carbon, estimated from 13C enrichment of bacterial lipids, contributed more than half of the total bacterial production. However, under conditions of high grazing pressure on phytoplankton with or without the addition of inorganic nutrients (HN~+~HG and LN~+~HG), the 13C enrichment of bacterial lipids was low compared with the high total bacterial production. BP therefore seems to depend mainly on freshly produced phytoplankton exudates during the early phase of phytoplankton bloom period. However, BP seems mainly relying on recycled carbon from viral lysis and predators under high grazing pressure.},

In this study, the diversity of nirS gene fragments (encoding cytochrome cd1-type nitrite reductase), physical/chemical parameters, and benthic N2-fluxes were analyzed in order to determine how denitrifier communities and biogeochemical activity vary along the estuary salinity gradient. The nirS gene fragments were PCR-amplified, cloned, and sequenced from sediment cores collected at five stations. Sequence analysis of 96 to 123 nirS clones from each station revealed extensive overall diversity in this estuary, as well as distinct spatial structure in the nirS sequence distributions. Both nirS-based richness and community composition varied among stations, with the most dramatic shifts occurring between low-salinity (oligohaline) and moderate-salinity (mesohaline) sites. For four samples collected in April, the nirS-based richness, nitrate concentrations, and N2-fluxes all decreased in parallel along the salinity gradient from the oligohaline northernmost station to the highest salinity (polyhaline) station near the mouth of the Bay. The vast majority of the 550 nirS sequences were distinct from cultivated denitrifiers, although many were closely related to environmental clones from other coastal and estuarine systems. Interestingly, 8 of the 172 OTUs identified accounted for 42\% of the total nirS clones, implying the presence of a few dominant and many rare genotypes, which were distributed in a non-random manner along the salinity gradient of Chesapeake Bay. These data, comprising the largest dataset to investigate nirS clone sequence diversity from an estuarine environment, also provided information that was required for the development of nirS microarrays to investigate the interaction of microbial diversity, environmental gradients, and biogeochemical activity.},

Multiple linear regression is used to derive an algorithm suggesting that the transfer efficiency of organic carbon, defined as the settling flux of organic carbon normalized to export production, increases with the flux of carbonate and decreases with water depth and seasonality. The algorithm predicts {$>$}80\% of the organic carbon transfer efficiency variability in diverse oceanic regions. The influence of the carbonate flux suggests that the ballasting effect of this biogenic mineral may be an important factor promoting export of organic carbon to the deep sea by increasing the density of settling particles. However, the lack of a similar effect for biogenic opal suggests that factors other than particle density also play a role. The adverse effect of increasing seasonality on the transfer efficiency of carbon to the deep sea is tentatively attributed to greater biodegradability of organic matter exported during bloom events. In high latitude opal-dominated regions with high f-ratios and seasonality, while a higher fraction of net production is exported, a higher fraction of the exported organic matter is remineralized before reaching bathypelagic depths. On the other hand, in warm, low latitude, carbonate-dominated regions with low f-ratios and seasonality, a higher fraction of the exported organic matter sinks to the deep sea.},

  abstract = {Few studies have directly measured sulfate reduction at hydrothermal vents, and relatively little is known about how environmental or ecological factors influence rates of sulfate reduction in vent environments. A better understanding of microbially mediated sulfate reduction in hydrothermal vent ecosystems may be achieved by integrating ecological and geochemical data with metabolic rate measurements. Here we present rates of microbially mediated sulfate reduction from three distinct hydrothermal vents in the Middle Valley vent field along the Juan de Fuca Ridge, as well as assessments of bacterial and archaeal diversity, estimates of total biomass and the abundance of functional genes related to sulfate reduction, and in situ geochemistry. Maximum rates of sulfate reduction occurred at 90 °C in all three deposits. Pyrosequencing and functional gene abundance data revealed differences in both biomass and community composition among sites, including differences in the abundance of known sulfate-reducing bacteria. The abundance of sequences for Thermodesulfovibro-like organisms and higher sulfate reduction rates at elevated temperatures suggests that Thermodesulfovibro-like organisms may have a role in sulfate reduction in warmer environments. The rates of sulfate reduction presented here suggest that—within anaerobic niches of hydrothermal deposits—heterotrophic sulfate reduction may be quite common and might contribute substantially to secondary productivity, underscoring the potential role of this process in both sulfur and carbon cycling at vents.},

  abstract = {This lively and engaging textbook explains the things you have to know in order to read empirical papers in the social and health sciences, as well as the techniques you need to build statistical models of your own. The author, David A. Freedman, explains the basic ideas of association and regression, and takes you through the current models that link these ideas to causality.  The focus is on applications of linear models, including generalized least squares and two-stage least squares, with probits and logits for binary variables. The bootstrap is developed as a technique for estimating bias and computing standard errors. Careful attention is paid to the principles of statistical inference. There is background material on study design, bivariate regression, and matrix algebra. To develop technique, there are computer labs with sample computer programs. The book is rich in exercises, most with answers.   Target audiences include advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students in statistics, as well as students and professionals in the social and health sciences. The discussion in the book is organized around published studies, as are many of the exercises. Relevant journal articles are reprinted at the back of the book. Freedman makes a thorough appraisal of the statistical methods in these papers and in a variety of other examples. He illustrates the principles of modeling, and the pitfalls. The discussion shows you how to think about the critical issues - including the connection (or lack of it) between the statistical models and the real phenomena.  Features of the book: • authoritative guidance from a well-known author with wide experience in teaching, research, and consulting • careful analysis of statistical issues in substantive applications  • no-nonsense, direct style • versatile structure, enabling the text to be used as a text in a course, or read on its own  • text that has been thoroughly class-tested at Berkeley • background material on regression and matrix algebra • plenty of exercises, most with solutions  • extra material for instructors, including data sets and code for lab projects (available from Cambridge University Press) • many new exercises and examples • reorganized, restructured, and revised chapters to aid teaching and understanding},

  abstract = {In their natural environments, microorganisms form complex systems of interactions. Understating the structure and organization of bacterial communities is likely to have broad medical and ecological consequences, yet a comprehensive description of the network of environmental interactions is currently lacking. Here, we mine co-occurrences in the scientific literature to construct such a network and demonstrate an expected pattern of association between the species’ lifestyle and the recorded number of co-occurring partners. We further focus on the well-annotated gut community and show that most co-occurrence interactions of typical gut bacteria occur within this community. The network is then clustered into species-groups that significantly correspond with natural occurring communities. The relationships between resource competition, metabolic yield and growth rate within the clusters correspond with the r/K selection theory. Overall, these results support the constructed clusters as a first approximation of a bacterial ecosystem model. This comprehensive collection of predicted communities forms a new data resource for further systematic characterization of the ecological design principals shaping communities. Here, we demonstrate its utility for predicting cooperation and inhibition within communities.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing based techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, have the potential to elucidate the complex inner workings of natural microbial communities - be they from the world's oceans or the human gut. A key step in exploring such data is the identification of dependencies between members of these communities, which is commonly achieved by correlation analysis. However, it has been known since the days of Karl Pearson that the analysis of the type of data generated by such techniques (referred to as compositional data) can produce unreliable results since the observed data take the form of relative fractions of genes or species, rather than their absolute abundances. Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, we show that such compositional effects can be widespread and severe: in some real data sets many of the correlations among taxa can be artifactual, and true correlations may even appear with opposite sign. Additionally, we show that community diversity is the key factor that modulates the acuteness of such compositional effects, and develop a new approach, called SparCC (available at https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/sparcc), which is capable of estimating correlation values from compositional data. To illustrate a potential application of SparCC, we infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. Using the SparCC network as a reference, we estimated that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60\% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data, and, as predicted, most of the erroneous links are found in the samples with the lowest diversity.},

  abstract = {Vibrio vulnificus, a bacterium ubiquitous in oysters and coastal water, is capable of causing ailments ranging from gastroenteritis to grievous wound infections or septicemia. The uptake of these bacteria into oysters is often examined in vitro by placing oysters in seawater amended with V. vulnificus. Multiple teams have obtained similar results in studies where laboratory-grown bacteria were observed to be rapidly taken up by oysters but quickly eliminated. This technique, along with suggested modifications, is reviewed here. In contrast, the natural microflora within oysters is notoriously difficult to eliminate via depuration. The reason for the transiency of exogenous bacteria is that those bacteria are competitively excluded by the oyster's preexisting microflora. Evidence of this phenomenon is shown using in vitro oyster studies and a multiyear in situ case study. Depuration of the endogenous oyster bacteria occurs naturally and can also be artificially induced, but both of these events require extreme conditions, natural or otherwise, as explained here. Finally, the “viable but nonculturable” (VBNC) state of Vibrio is discussed. This bacterial torpor can easily be confused with a reduction in bacterial abundance, as bacteria in this state fail to grow on culture media. Thus, oysters collected from colder months may appear to be relatively free of Vibrio but in reality harbor VBNC cells that respond to exogenous bacteria and prevent colonization of oyster matrices. Bacterial-uptake experiments combined with studies involving cell-free spent media are detailed that demonstrate this occurrence, which could explain why the microbial community in oysters does not always mirror that of the surrounding water.},

  abstract = {The export of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) from the surface ocean is poorly constrained. A better understanding of the magnitude and spatial distribution of this flux would improve our knowledge of the ocean carbon cycle and marine biogeochemistry. Here, we investigate controls over the spatial distribution of total alkalinity in the surface global ocean and produce a tracer for CaCO3 cycling. We took surface ocean bottle data for total alkalinity from global databases (GLODAP, CARINA, PACIFICA) and subtracted the effects of several processes: evaporation and precipitation, river discharge, and nutrient uptake and remineralization. The remaining variation in alkalinity exhibits a robust and coherent pattern including features of large amplitude and spatial extent. Most notably, the residual variation in alkalinity is more or less constant across low latitudes of the global ocean but shows a strong poleward increase. There are differences of \textasciitilde{} 110 μmol kg− 1 and \textasciitilde{} 85 μmol kg− 1 between low latitudes and the Southern Ocean and the subarctic North Pacific, respectively, but, in contrast, little increase in the high-latitude North Atlantic. This global pattern is most likely due to production and export of CaCO3 and to physical resupply of alkalinity from deep waters. The use of river corrections highlights the large errors that are produced, particularly in the Bay of Bengal and the North Atlantic, if alkalinity normalization assumes all low salinities to be caused by rainfall. The residual alkalinity data can be used as a tracer to indicate where in the world's ocean most CaCO3 export from the surface layer takes place, and of future changes in calcification, for instance due to ocean acidification.},

Here we investigate the offshore Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) where a secondary chlorophyll a maximum resides within the ODZ. Rates of primary production and carbon export from the mixed layer and productivity in the primary chlorophyll a maximum were consistent with oligotrophic waters. However, sediment trap carbon and nitrogen fluxes increased between 105 and 150\,m, indicating organic matter production within the ODZ. Metagenomic and metaproteomic characterization indicated that the secondary chlorophyll a maximum was attributable to the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, and numerous photosynthesis and carbon fixation proteins were detected. The presence of chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaea and the nitrite oxidizer Nitrospina and detection of nitrate oxidoreductase was consistent with cyanobacterial oxygen production within the ODZ. Cyanobacteria and cyanophage were also present on large ({$>$}30\,μm) particles and in sediment trap material. Particle cyanophage-to-host ratio exceeded 50, suggesting that viruses help convert cyanobacteria into sinking organic matter. Nitrate reduction and anammox proteins were detected, congruent with previously reported N2 production. We suggest that autochthonous organic matter production within the ODZ contributes to N2 production in the offshore ETNP.},

  abstract = {N2 production by denitrification can occur in anoxic water or potentially inside organic particles. Here we compare data from the Black Sea, a permanently anoxic basin, during two organic matter regimes: suspended particulate organic matter concentrations were high in the oxycline after the spring bloom in March 2005 compared to lower organic matter concentrations in June 2005, May and October 2007, July 2008, and May 2001. For all cruises, N2 gas had a maximum in the suboxic zone (O2 {$<$} 10 μmol/L). During the high organic matter event (March 2005), an additional shallower N2 gas and δ15N-N2 maxima occurred above the suboxic zone in the oxycline where oxygen concentrations were 30–50 μmol/L. Examination of 16S rRNA indicated that anammox bacteria were not present in the oxycline. The δ15N of biologically produced N2 in the oxycline in March 2005 was significantly enriched (+7‰ to +38‰), not depleted, as would be expected from water column fractionation. A simple diffusion calculation indicated that ammonium produced from remineralization inside particles could be oxidized to nitrate and then completely consumed by denitrification inside the particle. In this calculation, half of denitrified N atoms originated from organic N [δ15N = 11‰] and half of N atoms originated from ambient nitrate [δ15N = 5‰–7‰], producing enriched δ15N-N2 values. We suggest that denitrifiers were active in microzones inside particulates in hypoxic waters above the suboxic zone of the Black Sea. Denitrification in particles may also explain previous data from the oxycline above ocean oxygen deficient zones.},

  abstract = {Oxygen deficient zones host up to 50\% of marine N2 production and the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) is the largest marine oxygen deficient zone. We measured δ15N-NO3-, δ15N-NO2-, and δ15N-N2 at 7 stations along a transect normal to the coast in the heart of the ETNP oxygen deficient zone in 2012. The δ15N-N2 minimum was 0.34‰ at 300 m, which corresponded with the N2:Ar maximum. When the atmospheric N2 background was removed, the biological δ15N-N2 for the ODZ ranged from −7‰ to −22‰. In the ODZ, δ15N-NO3- ranged from 15 to 24‰ while δ15N-NO2- was generally between − 11 and −18‰, generating differences up to 40‰ between δ15N-NO3- and δ15N-NO2-. The isotopic separation between nitrite and nitrogen gas (Δ15N NO2-N2) changed sign from \textasciitilde 5‰ at the top of the oxygen deficient zone to \textasciitilde −10‰ at 300 m, indicating an important shift in nitrogen cycling with depth. We calculated the closed system Rayleigh isotope effect (ε) for N2 production from both the δ15N-DIN (εDIN = 26 ± 11‰) and δ15N-N2 (εN2 = 27 ± 6‰) data. When examined individually by depth, both εDIN and εN2 matched closely and both ε depth profiles showed maximal fractionation at 300 m. Additionally, closed system isotope effects were calculated for one offshore station from the Arabian Sea in 2007 using δ15N-N2 ( εN2 = 24 ± 4‰) and δ15N-DIN (εDIN = 26 ± 3‰). The relatively large isotope effects for N2 production appear to be found in both major offshore oxygen deficient zones, which implies a large denitrification term in the marine N budget.},

  abstract = {Autotrophic denitrification was measured in the southwestern coastal Black Sea, where the Bosporus Plume injects oxidized chemical species (especially O2 and NO3-) into the oxic, suboxic and anoxic layers. Prominent oxygen intrusions caused an overlap of NOx- and sulfide at the same station where autotrophic denitrification activity was detected with incubation experiments. Several bacteria that have been proposed to oxidize sulfide in other low oxygen environments were found in the Black Sea including SUP05, Sulfurimonas, Arcobacter, and BS-GSO2. Comparison of TRFLP profiles from this mixing zone station and the Western Gyre (a station not affected by the Bosporus Plume) indicate the greatest relative abundance of Sulfurimonas and Arcobacter at the appropriate depths at the mixing zone station. The autotrophic gammaproteobacterium BS-GSO2 correlated with ammonium fluxes rather than with sulfide fluxes and the maximum in SUP05 peak height was shallower than the depths where autotrophic denitrification was detected. Notably, anammox activity was not detected at the mixing zone station, though low levels of DNA from the anammox bacteria Candidatus Scalindua were present. These results provide evidence for a modified ecosystem with different N2 production pathways in the southwest coastal region compared to that found in the rest of the Black Sea. Moreover, the same Sulfurimonas phylotype (BS139) was previously detected on \&gt;30 μm particles in the suboxic zone of the Western Gyre along with DNA of potential sulfate reducers, so it is possible that particle-attached autotrophic denitrification may be an overlooked N2 production pathway in the central Black Sea as well.},

  abstract = {Nitrite oxidation is the second step of nitrification. It is the primary source of oceanic nitrate, the predominant form of bioavailable nitrogen in the ocean. Despite its obvious importance, nitrite oxidation has rarely been investigated in marine settings. We determined nitrite oxidation rates directly in N-15-incubation experiments and compared the rates with those of nitrate reduction to nitrite, ammonia oxidation, anammox, denitrification, as well as dissimilatory nitrate/nitrite reduction to ammonium in the Namibian oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Nitrite oxidation ({$<$}= 372 nM NO2- d(-1)) was detected throughout the OMZ even when in situ oxygen concentrations were low to non-detectable. Nitrite oxidation rates often exceeded ammonia oxidation rates, whereas nitrate reduction served as an alternative and significant source of nitrite. Nitrite oxidation and anammox co-occurred in these oxygen-deficient waters, suggesting that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) likely compete with anammox bacteria for nitrite when substrate availability became low. Among all of the known NOB genera targeted via catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, only Nitrospina and Nitrococcus were detectable in the Namibian OMZ samples investigated. These NOB were abundant throughout the OMZ and contributed up to similar to 9\% of total microbial community. Our combined results reveal that a considerable fraction of the recently recycled nitrogen or reduced NO3- was re-oxidized back to NO3- via nitrite oxidation, instead of being lost from the system through the anammox or denitrification pathways.

  abstract = {In describing suspended sediment conditions in the lower Chesapeake Bay, VA, USA, this paper reports and develops methods for distinguishing multiple particle populations in the bottom boundary layer of estuaries in general. In addition, a novel application of the acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) is shown to estimate in situ particle fall velocity at a single point without affecting the ambient turbulence. In situ estimates of suspended sediment concentration from ADV, optical backscatter, and laser in situ scattering and transmissometry (LISST) instruments are compared with gravimetrically determined mass concentrations from pumped water samples. In this environment, acoustic backscatter from the ADV proved to be the best estimator of mass concentrations due to its apparent insensitivity to the size or density of muddy aggregates. The concentration estimates and the relative sensitivities of the instruments to particle size and density combined with size distribution information from the LISST reveal the characteristics of multiple particle populations in the bottom boundary layer. Two rapidly settling sediment populations are suggested with similar fall velocities but distinct critical erosion stresses. A slowly settling background population is also identified whose concentration varies over meteorological time scales. Fall velocities are estimated analytically from a balance of settling and diffusive flux gradients using two methods, one employing Reynolds concentration flux, and the other estimating eddy diffusivity using the von-Karman Prandtl equation. Comparison of the local change and advective terms in the solute transport equation to the magnitude of the settling term suggests that a balance between the settling and resuspension term is a good first order approximation at this site, validating the indirect method for estimating settling velocity. Single elevation estimates of fall velocity using the ADV to estimate Reynolds concentration flux produced the best estimates of fall velocity which are on the order of 1mm/s.},

Using high-resolution molecular fingerprinting, we demonstrate the existence of extraordinarily repeatable temporal patterns in the community composition of 171 operational taxonomic units of marine bacterioplankton over 4.5 years at our Microbial Observatory site, 20 km off the southern California coast. These patterns in distribution and abundance of microbial taxa were highly predictable and significantly influenced by a broad range of both abiotic and biotic factors. These findings provide statistically robust demonstration of temporal patterning in marine bacterial distribution and abundance, which suggests that the distribution and abundance of bacterial taxa may modulate ecosystem function and response and that a significant subset of the bacteria exhibit low levels of functional redundancy as documented for many plant and animal communities.},

  abstract = {We know very little about species distributions in prokaryotic marine plankton. Such information is very interesting in its own right, and ignorance of it is also beginning to hamper process studies, such as those on viral infection. New DNA- and RNA-based approaches avoid many prior limitations. Here we discuss four such applications: (1) cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes to produce lists of what types of organisms are present; (2) quantification of these individual types in marine samples by nucleic acid hybridization, including single cell fluorescence; (3) quantitative comparison by DNA-DNA hybridization of entire microbial communities in terms of shared common types, without knowledge of community components; and (4) finding cultures that are representative of native communities. Several previously uncharacterized types of bacteria and archaea (probably including novel phyla) are present in marine plankton. Evidence from both the Atlantic and Pacific suggests that as-of-yet uncultivated archaea may dominate the deep sea, and thus may be the most abundant group of organisms on Earth. Such archaea are in surface waters as well, and can be visualized with fluorescent probes and enriched at room temperature with addition of organic nutrients. Community hybridization shows that variability of microbial community compositions in time and space is high. Although most native bacteria do not grow in culture, some proteobacterial cultures appear by genomic hybridization to be representative of certain communities. These and other results indicate the utility of DNA- and RNA-based methods.},

Here we report 16S rRNA sequences obtained from Pacific Ocean bacterioplankton samples collected from depths of 100 m and 500 m. Among these we found sequences only distantly related to those of any organisms previously characterized by 16S rRNA sequences, with similarities to the nearest such relatives (extreme thermophiles) approximately the same as those between animals and plants. We suggest that these sequences are from a previously undescribed archaebacterial group that may have diverged from the ancestors of characterized organisms very early in evolution.},

This suggests an energetic role for proteorhodopsins. However, results from a growing number of investigations do not readily fit this model, which indicates that proteorhodopsins could have a range of physiological functions.},

  abstract = {Despite viral contamination of recreational waters, only bacterial, not viral, indicators are monitored routinely, due to a lack of rapid and cost-effective assays. We used negatively charged filters to capture enteroviruses from seawater and freshwater. Viral RNA was extracted using a commercial kit, and the viruses were quantified by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Poliovirus (6.6 to 330,000 virus particles/ml) was added to samples from watersheds in Los Angeles, California, and analysis showed that with 50-ml samples, a cellulose acetate/nitrate (HA) filter yielded final recovery of 51\% (r2 = 0.99) in fresh water and 23\% (r2 = 0.90) in seawater. However, for additions of low levels of virus (more likely to represent field samples; {$<$}104 enterovirus particles/ml), the recovery was lower and more variable, with HA being best in freshwater (17\%, r2 = 0.97) and the type GF/F glass filter having higher average recovery in seawater (GF/F, 17\%; r2 = 0.93; HA 12\%, r2 = 0.87). The optimized method was used with 1-liter field samples from two very different freshwater “creeks” that drain into Santa Monica Bay, California: Topanga Creek (TC), a relatively pristine mountain creek, and Ballona Creek (BC), a concrete-lined urban storm drain. One TC site out of 10 and 2 BC sites out of 7 tested significantly positive for enteroviruses, with higher enterovirus concentrations in BC than in TC (ca. 10 to 25 versus 1 equivalent enterovirus particle/ml). The presented filtration-qRT-PCR approach is fast ({$<$}8 h from sampling to results), sensitive, and cost efficient and is promising for monitoring viral contamination in environmental water samples.},

  abstract = {Marine microbial diversity is important yet poorly-known, due to low culturability and undersampling. However, 16S rRNA gene sequences cloned directly from biomass allow us to know what microbial types are present, irrespective of culturing, and to create probes suitable for biodiversity studies. Many sequences are needed for good probe design. Here we report on sequences from 57 deep sea clones, obtained by the polymerase chain reaction with `universal' primers, from 500 m and 3000 m depths in the northeast Pacific and 1000 m depth in the subtropical Atlantic. The most common group, with 19 of the new sequences (10 Atlantic), was a recently reported crenarchaeal cluster, Group I. We also found 6 sequences in 2 other archaeal groups in the broad methanogen-halophile lineage; 2 of these were in a distinct Lineage not previously reported. The bacterial sequences included 22 dispersed among the alpha and gamma Proteobacteria (8 related to SAR 11), 5 related to a previously reported broad group (Group A) of marine clones poorly affiliated with known (cultured and sequenced) major bacterial divisions, 6 in a second group with little affiliation to any previously reported division (we call this Group B), 1 in a third possible major novel group, 2 deeply branched within the `Green Nonsulfur' lineage, and 1 branching with a soil clone. In contrast to the vast majority of the sequences, a cluster of 5 sequences was very close to a cultured marine proteobacterium, Alteromonas macleodii. It appeared that 5 of the clones were chimeric, although this label is difficult to apply when sequences are only distantly related to those in the database, as was common. We conclude that the deep sea contains numerous novel and widespread major prokaryotic Lineages. Given the huge volume of this habitat and typical bacterial abundances, it appears that the previously unknown archaeal and bacterial groups may be the most abundant organisms on Earth.},

  abstract = {Scientists have observed that molecular markers for COVID-19 can be detected in wastewater of infected communities both during an outbreak and, in some cases, before the first case is confirmed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other government entities are considering whether to add community surveillance through wastewater monitoring to assist in tracking disease prevalence and guiding public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. This scientific breakthrough may lead to many useful potential applications for tracking disease, intensifying testing, initiating social distancing or quarantines, and even lifting restrictions once a cessation of infection is detected and confirmed. Yet, new technologies developed in response to a public health crisis may raise difficult legal and ethical questions about how such technologies may impact both the public health and civil liberties of the population. This paper describes recent scientific evidence regarding COVID-19 detection in wastewater, identifying public health benefits that may result from this breakthrough, as well as the limitations of existing data. The paper then assesses the legal and ethical implications of implementing policy based on positive sewage signals. It concludes that the first step to implementing legal and ethical wastewater monitoring is to develop scientific understanding. Even if reliability and efficacy are established, limits on sample and data collection, use, and sharing must also be considered to prevent undermining privacy and autonomy in order to implement these public health strategies consistent with legal and ethical considerations.},

This study assessed the viral quality of the Umgeni River in South Africa seasonally. A two-step tangential flow filtration process was setup to remove the bacteria and to concentrate the virus populations from large volume water samples. The concentrated water samples contained up to 659 and 550\,pfu/mL of somatic and F-RNA coliphages, respectively. Several virus families including Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae and Reoviridae were found in the river based on the morphologies examined under transmission electron microscopy. All concentrated water samples produced substantial cytopathic effects on the Vero, HEK 293, Hela and A549 cell lines. These results indicate the potential of viruses in the water samples especially from the lower catchment areas of the Umgeni River to infect human hosts throughout the year. The present study highlights the importance of routine environmental surveillance of human enteric viruses in water sources. This can contribute to a better understanding of the actual burden of disease on those who might be using the water directly without treatment.},

It is unclear how the taxonomic composition and metabolism of OMZ microorganisms vary between particle-associated and free-living size fractions. We used amplicon (16S rRNA gene) and shotgun metagenome sequencing to compare microbial communities from large ({$>$}1.6 μm) and small (0.2–1.6 μm) filter size fractions along a depth gradient in the OMZ off Chile. Despite steep vertical redox gradients, size fraction was a significantly stronger predictor of community composition compared to depth. Phylogenetic diversity showed contrasting patterns, decreasing towards the anoxic OMZ core in the small size fraction, but exhibiting maximal values at these depths within the larger size fraction. Fraction-specific distributions were evident for key OMZ taxa, including anammox planctomycetes, whose coding sequences were enriched up to threefold in the 0.2–1.6 μm community. Functional gene composition also differed between fractions, with the {$>$}1.6 μm community significantly enriched in genes mediating social interactions, including motility, adhesion, cell-to-cell transfer, antibiotic resistance and mobile element activity. Prokaryotic transposase genes were three to six fold more abundant in this fraction, comprising up to 2\% of protein-coding sequences, suggesting that particle surfaces may act as hotbeds for transposition-based genome changes in marine microbes. Genes for nitric and nitrous oxide reduction were also more abundant (three to seven fold) in the larger size fraction, suggesting microniche partitioning of key denitrification steps. These results highlight an important role for surface attachment in shaping community metabolic potential and genome content in OMZ microorganisms.},

It remains unclear, however, how metabolic activities differ between PA and FL fractions. We combined rate measurements with metatranscriptomics to quantify PA and FL microbial activity in the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific, focusing on dissimilatory processes of the nitrogen (N) cycle. Bacterial gene counts were 8- to 15-fold higher in the FL compared with the PA fraction. However, rates of all measured N cycle processes, excluding ammonia oxidation, declined significantly following particle ({$>$}1.6\,μm) removal. Without particles, rates of nitrate reduction to nitrite (1.5–9.4nMNd−1) fell to zero and N2 production by denitrification (0.5–1.7nMNd−1) and anammox (0.3–1.9nMNd−1) declined by 53–85\%. The proportional representation of major microbial taxa and N cycle gene transcripts in metatranscriptomes followed fraction-specific trends. Transcripts encoding nitrate reductase were uniform among PA and FL fractions, whereas anammox-associated transcripts were proportionately enriched up to 15-fold in the FL fraction. In contrast, transcripts encoding enzymes for N2O and N2 production by denitrification were enriched up to 28-fold in PA samples. These patterns suggest that the majority of N cycle activity, excluding N2O and N2 production by denitrification, is confined to a FL majority that is critically dependent on access to particles, likely as a source of organic carbon and inorganic N. Variable particle distributions may drive heterogeneity in N cycle activity and gene expression in OMZs.},

In this study, we have explored how experimental conditions affect measured rates of O-2 consumption in low-O-2 waters from the anoxic basin of Golfo Dulce (Costa Rica) and oceanic waters off Chile-Peru. High-sensitivity optode dots placed within all-glass incubation containers allowed for high resolution O-2 concentration measurements in the nanomolar and low mu M range and thus also for the determination of rates of oxygen consumption by microbial communities. Consumption rates increased dramatically (from 3 and up to 60 times) by prolonged incubations, and started to increase after 4-5 h in surface waters and after 10-15 h in water from below the upper mixed layer. Estimated maximum growth rates during the incubations suggest the growth of opportunistic microorganism with doubling times as low as 2.8 and 4.6 h for the coastal waters of Golfo Dulce (Costa Rica) and oceanic waters off Chile and Peru, respectively. Deoxygenation by inert gas bubbling led to increases in subsequently determined rates, possibly by liberation of organics from lysis of sensitive organisms, particle or aggregate alterations or other processes mediated by the strong turbulence. Stirring of the water during the incubation led to an about 50\% increase in samples previously deoxygenated by bubbling, but had no effect in untreated samples. Our data indicate that data for microbial activity obtained by short incubations of minimally manipulated water are most reliable, but deoxygenation is a prerequisite for many laboratory experiments, such as determination of denitrification rates, as O-2 contamination by sampling is practically impossible to avoid.},

  abstract = {The intensive field observational phase of JGOFS in the North Atlantic Ocean has shown the importance of oceanic mesoscale variability on biogeochemical cycles and on the strength of the ocean biological pump. Mesoscale physical dynamics govern the major time/space scales of bulk biological variability (biomass, production and export). Mesoscale eddies seem to have a strong impact on the ecosystem structure and functioning, but observational evidence is rather limited. For the signature of the mesoscale features to exist in the ecosystem, the comparison of temporal scales of formation and evolution of mesoscale features and reaction of the ecosystem is a key factor. Biological patterns are driven by active changes in biological source and sink terms rather than simply by passive turbulent mixing. A first modelling assessment of the regional balances between horizontal and vertical eddy-induced nutrient supplies in the euphotic zone shows that the horizontal transport predominates over the vertical route in the subtropical gyre, whereas the reverse holds true for the other biogeochemical provinces of the North Atlantic. Presently, despite some difference in numbers, the net impact of modelled eddies yields an enhancement of the biological productivity in most provinces of the North Atlantic Ocean. Key issues remaining include variation on the mesoscale of subsurface particle and dissolved organic matter remineralization, improved knowledge of the ecological response to patterns of variability, synopticity in mesoscale surveys along with refining measures of biogeochemical time/space variability. Eventual success of assimilation of in situ and satellite data, still in its infancy in coupled physical/biogeochemical models, will be crucial to achieve JGOFS synthesis in answering which data are most informative, standing stocks or rates, and which ones are relevant. Depending on which end of the spectrum quantification of the effect of mesoscale features on production and community structure is required, complementary strategies are offered. Either one may choose to increase resolution of models up to the very fine mesoscale features scale (a few kms) for the high end, or to include a parametric representation of eddies for the low end.},

  abstract = {The pelagic realm of the dark ocean is characterized by high hydrostatic pressure, low temperature, high-inorganic nutrients, and low organic carbon concentrations. Measurements of metabolic activities of bathypelagic bacteria are often underestimated due to the technological limitations in recovering samples and maintaining them under in situ environmental conditions. Moreover, most of the pressure-retaining samplers, developed by a number of different labs, able to maintain seawater samples at in situ pressure during recovery have remained at the prototype stage, and therefore not available to the scientific community. In this paper, we will describe a ready-to-use pressure-retaining sampler, which can be adapted to use on a CTD-carousel sampler. As well as being able to recover samples under in situ high pressure (up to 60 MPa) we propose a sample processing in equi-pressure mode. Using a piloted pressure generator, we present how to perform sub-sampling and transfer of samples in equi-pressure mode to obtain replicates and perform hyperbaric experiments safely and efficiently (with {$<$}2\% pressure variability). As proof of concept, we describe a field application (prokaryotic activity measurements and incubation experiment) with samples collected at 3,000m-depth in the Mediterranean Sea. Sampling, sub-sampling, transfer, and incubations were performed under in situ high pressure conditions and compared to those performed following decompression and incubation at atmospheric pressure. Three successive incubations were made for each condition using direct dissolved-oxygen concentration measurements to determine the incubation times. Subsamples were collected at the end of each incubation to monitor the prokaryotic diversity, using 16S-rDNA/rRNA high-throughput sequencing. Our results demonstrated that oxygen consumption by prokaryotes is always higher under in situ conditions than after decompression and incubation at atmospheric pressure. In addition, over time, the variations in the prokaryotic community composition and structure are seen to be driven by the different experimental conditions. Finally, within samples maintained under in situ high pressure conditions, the active (16S rRNA) prokaryotic community was dominated by sequences affiliated with rare families containing piezophilic isolates, such as Oceanospirillaceae or Colwelliaceae. These results demonstrate the biological importance of maintaining in situ conditions during and after sampling in deep-sea environments.},

  abstract = {The large quantities of particles delivered by the Mackenzie River to the coastal Beaufort Sea (Arctic Ocean) have implications for the spatial distribution, composition and productivity of its bacterial communities. Our objectives in this study were: (1) to assess the contribution of particle-associated bacteria (fraction≥3~µm) to total bacterial production and their relationships with changing environmental conditions along a surface water transect; (2) to examine how particle-based heterotrophy changes over the annual cycle (Nov 2003–Aug 2004); and (3) to determine whether particle-associated bacterial assemblages differ in composition from the free-living communities (fraction{$<$}3~µm). Our transect results showed that particle-associated bacteria contributed a variable percentage of leucine-based (BP-Leu) and thymidine-based (BP-TdR) bacterial production, with values up to 98\% at the inshore, low salinity stations. The relative contribution of particle-associated bacteria to total BP-Leu was positively correlated with temperature and particulate organic material (POM) concentration. The annual dataset showed low activities of particle-associated bacteria during late fall and most of the winter, and a period of high particle-associated activity in spring and summer, likely related to the seasonal inputs of riverine POM. Results from catalyzed reporter deposition for fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) confirmed the dominance of Bacteria and presence of Archaea (43–84\% and 0.2–5.5\% of DAPI counts, respectively), which were evenly distributed throughout the Mackenzie Shelf, and not significantly related to environmental variables. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed changes in the bacterial community structure among riverine, estuarine and marine stations, with separation according to temperature and salinity. There was evidence of differences between the particle-associated and free-living bacterial assemblages at the estuarine stations with highest POM content. Particle-associated bacteria are an important functional component of this Arctic ecosystem. Under a warmer climate, they are likely to play an increasing role in coastal biogeochemistry and carbon fluxes as a result of permafrost melting and increased particle transport from the tundra to coastal waters.},

  abstract = {Advances in technology have resulted in a new instrument that is designed for in-situ determination of particle size spectra. Such an instrument that can measure undisturbed particle size distributions is much needed for sediment transport studies. The LISST-100 (Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissometry) uses the principle of laser diffraction to obtain the size distribution and volume concentration of suspended material in 32 size classes logarithmically spaced between 1.25 and 250μm. This paper describes a laboratory evaluation of the ability of LISST-100 to determine particle sizes using suspensions of single size, artificial particles. Findings show the instrument is able to determine particle size to within about 10\% with increasing error as particle size increases. The instrument determines volume (or mass) concentration using a volume conversion factor Cv. This volume conversion factor is theoretically a constant. In the laboratory evaluation Cv is found to vary by a factor of about three over the particle size range between 5 and 200μm. Results from field studies in South San Francisco Bay show that values of mass concentration of suspended marine sediments estimated by LISST-100 agree favorably with estimates from optical backscatterance sensors if an appropriate value of Cv, according to mean size, is used and the assumed average particle (aggregate) density is carefully chosen. Analyses of size distribution of suspended materials in South San Francisco Bay over multiple tide cycles suggest the likelihood of different sources of sediment because of different size characteristics during flood and ebb cycles.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton sinking is an important property that can determine community composition in the photic zone and material loss to the deep ocean. To date, studies of diatom suspension have relied on bulk measurements with assumptions that bulk rates adequately capture the essential characteristics of diatom sinking. However, recent work has illustrated that individual diatom sinking rates vary considerably from the mean bulk rate. In this study, we apply high-resolution optical techniques, individual-based observations of diatom sinking and a recently developed method of flow visualization around freely sinking cells. The results show that in both field samples and laboratory cultures, some large species of centric diatoms are capable of a novel behaviour, whereby cells undergo bursts of rapid sinking that alternate with near-zero sinking rates on the timescales of seconds. We also demonstrate that this behaviour is under direct metabolic control of the cell. We discuss these results in the context of implications for nutrient flux to the cell surface. While nutrient flux in large diatoms increases during fast sinking, current mass transport models cannot incorporate the unsteady sinking behaviour observed in this study. However, large diatoms appear capable of benefiting from the enhanced nutrient flux to their surface during rapid sinking even during brief intervening periods of near-zero sinking rates.},

  abstract = {Background Bacterial infections are common in bivalve larvae and can lead to significant mortality, notably in hatcheries. Numerous studies have identified the pathogenic bacteria involved in such mortalities, but physiological changes associated with pathogen exposure at larval stage are still poorly understood. In the present study, we used an integrative approach including physiological, enzymatic, biochemical, and molecular analyses to investigate changes in energy metabolism, lipid remodelling, cellular stress, and immune status of Crassostrea gigas larvae subjected to experimental infection with the pathogenic bacteria Vibrio coralliilyticus. Findings Our results showed that V. coralliilyticus exposure induced (1) limited but significant increase of larvae mortality compared with controls, (2) declined feeding activity, which resulted in energy status changes (i.e. reserve consumption, β-oxidation, decline of metabolic rate), (3) fatty acid remodeling of polar lipids (changes in phosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylcholine composition`, non-methylene–interrupted fatty acids accumulation, lower content of major C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as activation of desaturases, phospholipase and lipoxygenase), (4) activation of antioxidant defenses (catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxin) and cytoprotective processes (heat shock protein 70, pernin), and (5) activation of the immune response (non-self recognition, NF-κκ signaling pathway, haematopoiesis, eiconosoids and lysophosphatidyl acid synthesis, inhibitor of metalloproteinase and antimicrobial peptides). Conclusion Overall, our results allowed us to propose an integrative view of changes induced by a bacterial infection in Pacific oyster larvae, opening new perspectives on the response of marine bivalve larvae to infections.},

While oysters are a primary vehicle for infection, few studies have examined the wider distribution of NoV in the estuarine environment. Active shellfish-harvesting areas in Georgia were examined for the prevalence, genotype diversity, and concentrations of NoV in a variety of estuarine sample types over the course of 1 year. Of the 225 samples (9 oyster, 72 water, 72 63- to 200-μm plankton, and 72 {$>$}200-μm plankton) collected from 12 stations across two estuaries, 21 samples (9.3\%) tested positive for NoV. By sample type, 55.0\% (5/9) of oysters, 8.3\% (6/72) of water samples, 11.1\% (8/72) of 63- to 200-μm plankton samples, and 2.8\% (2/72) of {$>$}200-μm plankton samples were positive for human NoV. The two NoV-positive {$>$}200-μm plankton samples, which contained mainly zooplankton, had the greatest quantity of NoV genomes (3.5 × 1013 and 1.7 × 1015 genomes g−1) of any sample tested. The majority, 90.5\% (19/21), of the samples tested positive for genogroup I NoV, and only 9.5\% (2/21) of the samples tested positive for genogroup II. The high concentrations of NoV in plankton samples compared to water and oyster samples were unexpected and provide new insights into the presence and distribution of human NoV in the water environment.},

FC abundance was measured in raw and treated sewage by plate counts on selective medium and rapid β-d-glucuronidase (GLUase)-based assays.

  abstract = {Across a limited depth range (5–10m) on many continental shelves, the dominant sediment size changes from sand to mud. This important boundary, called the sand–mud transition (SMT), separates distinct benthic habitats, causes a significant change in acoustic backscatter, represents a key facies change, and delimits more surface-reactive mud from less surface-reactive sand. With the goal of improving dynamical understanding of the SMT, surficial sediments were characterized across two SMTs on the Adriatic continental shelf of Italy. Geometric mean diameter, specific surface area (SSA), mud fraction ({$<$}63μm) and heavy metal concentrations were all measured. The SMT related to the Tronto River is identified between 15 and 20m water depth while the SMT associated with the Pescara River varies between 15 and 25m water depth. The sediment properties correlate with a new, process-based sedimentological parameter that quantifies the fraction of the sediment in the seabed that was delivered as flocs. These correlations suggest that floc dynamics exert strong influence over sediment textural properties and metal concentrations. Relative constancy in the depth of the SMT along this portion of the margin and its lack of evolution over a period during which sediment input to the margin has dramatically decreased suggest that on the Adriatic continental shelf energy is the dominant control on the depth of the SMT.},

  abstract = {Geosmin is an irregular sesquiterpene, produced from the universal sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (also known as farnesyl diphosphate), in a two-step Mg2+-dependent reaction. Geosmin, along with the irregular monoterpene 2-methylisoborneol, together account for the majority of biologically-caused taste and odor outbreaks in drinking water worldwide. Geosmin has a distinct earthy or musty odor, which most people can easily smell. The odor detection threshold of geosmin is very low, ranging from 0.006 to 0.01 micrograms per liter in water. Geosmin is also responsible for the earthy taste of beetroots and a contributor to the strong scent (petrichor) that occurs in the air when rain falls after a dry spell of weather or when soil is disturbed.In chemical terms, it is a bicyclic alcohol with formula C12H22O, a derivative of decalin. Its name is derived from the Ancient Greek γεω- geō- "earth" and ὀσμή osmḗ "smell".  The word was coined in 1965 by the American biochemist Nancy N. Gerber (1929–1985) and the French-American biologist Hubert A. Lechevalier (1926–2015).},

  abstract = {Copepods can be associated with different kinds and different numbers of bacteria. This was already shown in the past with culture-dependent microbial methods or microscopy and more recently by using molecular tools. In our present study, we investigated the bacterial community of four frequently occurring copepod species, Acartia sp., Temora longicornis, Centropages sp. and Calanus helgolandicus from Helgoland Roads (North Sea) over a period of 2 years using DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and subsequent sequencing of 16S-rDNA fragments. To complement the PCR-DGGE analyses, clone libraries of copepod samples from June 2007 to 208 were generated. Based on the DGGE banding patterns of the two years survey, we found no significant differences between the communities of distinct copepod species, nor did we find any seasonality. Overall, we identified 67 phylotypes ({$>$}97 \% similarity) falling into the bacterial phyla of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The most abundant phylotypes were affiliated to the Alphaproteobacteria. In comparison with PCR-DGGE and clone libraries, phylotypes of the Gammaproteobacteria dominated the clone libraries, whereas Alphaproteobacteria were most abundant in the PCR-DGGE analyses.},

  abstract = {For decades, untreated sewage flowing northward from Tijuana, Mexico, via the Tijuana River has adversely affected the water quality of the recreational beaches of San Diego, California. We used quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to measure the levels of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and enteroviruses in coastal waters near the United States-Mexico border and compared these levels to those of the conventional fecal indicators, Escherichia coli and enterococci. Over a 2-year period from 2003 to 2005, a total of 20 samples were assayed at two sites during both wet and dry weather: the surfzone at the mouth of the Tijuana River and the surfzone near the pier at Imperial Beach (IB), California (about 2 km north of the mouth of the Tijuana River). HAV and enterovirus were detected in 79 and 93\% of the wet-weather samples, respectively. HAV concentrations in these samples ranged from 105 to 30,771 viral particles/liter, and enterovirus levels ranged from 7 to 4,417 viral particles/liter. The concentrations of HAV and enterovirus were below the limit of detection for all dry weather samples collected at IB. Regression analyses showed a significant correlation between the densities of both fecal bacterial indicators and the levels of HAV (R2 {$>$} 0.61, P {$<$} 0.0001) and enterovirus (R2 {$>$} 0.70, P {$<$} 0.0001), a finding that supports the use of conventional bacterial indicators to predict the levels of these viruses in recreational marine waters.},

  abstract = {Diel and seasonal variations in abundance, activity, and structure of particle-attached vs free-living bacterial communities were investigated in offshore NW Mediterranean Sea (0–1000 m). Attached bacteria were always less abundant and less diverse but generally more active than free-living bacteria. The most important finding of this study was that the activity of attached bacteria showed pronounced diel variations in the upper mixed water column with higher activities at night. Under mesotrophic conditions, the contribution of attached bacteria to total bacterial activity increased from less than 10\% at day time to 83\% at night time. At high chlorophyll a concentration, the highest cell-specific activities and contribution to total bacterial activity were due to free-living bacteria at day and to attached bacteria at night. Under summer oligotrophic conditions, free-living bacteria dominated and contributed to the most important part of the bacterial activity at both day and night, whereas attached bacteria were much less abundant but presented the highest cell-specific activities. These diel and seasonal variations in activities were concomitant to changes in bacterial community structure, mainly in the upper layer. The number of attached ribotypes was fairly constant suggesting that particles are colonized by a relatively limited number of ubiquitous ribotypes. Most of these ribotypes were also free-living ribotypes suggesting that attached bacteria probably originate from colonization of newly formed particles by free-living bacteria in the upper layer. These results reinforce the biogeochemical role of attached bacteria in the cycling of particulate organic carbon in the NW Mediterranean Sea and the importance of diel variability in these processes.},

Twenty-one sites in and around Monterey Bay were surveyed for evidence of microcystin toxin (2010–2011) at the land–sea interface. Following this initial survey four major watersheds in the Monterey Bay area were surveyed (2011–2013) for microcystin concentration, nutrients, alkalinity and water temperature to identify potential environmental factors correlated with the abundance of microcystin at the land–sea interface. During the first year microcystin was detected in 15 of 21 sites. Data from years two and three were analyzed by principal components analysis and mixed effects model. Results indicated that coastal nutrient loading (nitrate, phosphate silicate, ammonium, urea), were statistically significant predictors of the microcystin concentrations in the watersheds with clear evidence for seasonality at some sites. Microcystin was frequently at highest concentration in the autumn; however, at some locations high levels of toxin were measured during spring. Because this toxin has the ability to biomagnify and persist within food webs, elevated levels within the watershed may decrease potential for health and survival of wildlife and humans exposed to freshwater and marine waters. The widespread occurrence of microcystin at low to moderate levels throughout the year and throughout the sampled watersheds demonstrates the potential difficulty for management.},

We examined toxin uptake and release in marine mussels for both particulate and dissolved phases of the hepatotoxin microcystin, produced by the freshwater cyanobacterial genus Microcystis. We also extended our experimental investigation of particulate toxin to include oysters (Crassostrea sp.) grown commercially for aquaculture. California mussels (Mytilus californianus) and oysters were exposed to Microcystis and microcystin toxin for 24h at varying concentrations, and then were placed in constantly flowing seawater and sampled through time simulating riverine flushing events to the coastal ocean. Mussels exposed to particulate microcystin purged the toxin slowly, with toxin detectable for at least 8 weeks post-exposure and maximum toxin of 39.11ng/g after exposure to 26.65μg/L microcystins. Dissolved toxin was also taken up by California mussels, with maximum concentrations of 20.74ng/g after exposure to 7.74μg/L microcystin, but was purged more rapidly. Oysters also took up particulate toxin but purged it more quickly than mussels. Additionally, naturally occurring marine mussels collected from San Francisco Bay tested positive for high levels of microcystin toxin. These results suggest that ephemeral discharge of Microcystis or microcystin to estuaries and the coastal ocean accumulate in higher trophic levels for weeks to months following exposure.},

Ikonos and Quickbird optical satellite images of sea surface glint revealed approximate to 100 m spectral anomalies in km(2) averaging patches in regions leading from the Honolulu Sand Island Municipal Outfall diffuser to distances up to 20 km. To determine the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, the RASP expeditions monitored the waters adjacent to the outfall with an array of hydrographic, optical and turbulence microstructure sensors in anomaly and ambient background regions. Drogue tracks and mean turbulence parameters for 2 x 10(4) microstructure patches were analyzed to understand complex turbulence, fossil turbulence and zombie turbulence near-vertical internal wave transport processes. The dominant mechanism appears to be generic to stratified natural fluids including planet and star atmospheres and is termed beamed zombie turbulence maser action (BZTMA). Most of the bottom turbulent kinetic energy is converted to approximate to 100 in fossil turbulence waves. These activate secondary (zombie) turbulence in outfall fossil turbulence patches that transmit heat, mass, chemical species, momentum and information vertically to the sea surface for detection in an efficient maser action. The transport is beamed in intermittent mixing chimneys.},

  abstract = {Optical particle measurements are emerging as an important technique for understanding the ocean carbon cycle, including contributions to estimates of their downward flux, which sequesters CO2 in the deep sea. Optical instruments can be used from ships or installed on autonomous platforms, delivering much greater spatial and temporal coverage of particles in the mesopelagic zone of the ocean than traditional techniques, such as sediment traps. Technologies to image particles have advanced greatly over the last two decades, but the quantitative translation of these immense datasets into biogeochemical properties remains a challenge. In particular, advances are needed to enable the optimal translation of imaged objects into carbon contents and sinking velocities. In addition, different devices often measure different optical properties, leading to difficulties in comparing results. Here we provide a practical overview of the challenges and potential of using these instruments, as a step towards improvement and expansion of their applications.},

Data treatment effected the estimation of community richness over a 6-year period, whereby 8794 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified using single-linkage preclustering and 21 130 OTUs were identified by denoising the data. The Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant Class, and the most frequently recorded OTUs were members of the Rickettsiales (SAR 11) and Rhodobacteriales. This near-surface ocean bacterial community showed strong repeatable seasonal patterns, which were defined by winter peaks in diversity across all years. Environmental variables explained far more variation in seasonally predictable bacteria than did data on protists or metazoan biomass. Change in day length alone explains {$>$}65\% of the variance in community diversity. The results suggested that seasonal changes in environmental variables are more important than trophic interactions. Interestingly, microbial association network analysis showed that correlations in abundance were stronger within bacterial taxa rather than between bacteria and eukaryotes, or between bacteria and environmental variables.},

  abstract = {Very few marine microbial communities are well characterized even with the weight of research effort presently devoted to it. Only a small proportion of this effort has been aimed at investigating temporal community structure. Here we present the first report of the application of high-throughput pyrosequencing to investigate intra-annual bacterial community structure. Microbial diversity was determined for 12 time points at the surface of the L4 sampling site in the Western English Channel. This was performed over 11 months during 2007. A total of 182 560 sequences from the V6 hyper-variable region of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA) were obtained; there were between 11 327 and 17 339 reads per sample. Approximately 7000 genera were identified, with one in every 25 reads being attributed to a new genus; yet this level of sampling far from exhausted the total diversity present at any one time point. The total data set contained 17 673 unique sequences. Only 93 (0.5\%) were found at all time points, yet these few lineages comprised 50\% of the total reads sequenced. The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria (50\% of all sequenced reads), while the SAR11 clade comprised 21\% of the ubiquitous reads and ∼12\% of the total sequenced reads. In contrast, 78\% of all operational taxonomic units were only found at one time point and 67\% were only found once, evidence of a large and transient rare assemblage. This time series shows evidence of seasonally structured community diversity. There is also evidence for seasonal succession, primarily reflecting changes among dominant taxa. These changes in structure were significantly correlated to a combination of temperature, phosphate and silicate concentrations.},

These regions are defined by extremely low oxygen concentrations ({$<$}20–45 μmol kg−1), cover wide expanses of the ocean, and are associated with productive oceanic and coastal regions. OMZs have expanded over the past 50 years, and this expansion is predicted to continue as the climate warms worldwide. Shoaling of the upper boundaries of the OMZs accompanies OMZ expansion, and decreased oxygen at shallower depths can affect all marine organisms through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. Effects include altered microbial processes that produce and consume key nutrients and gases, changes in predator-prey dynamics, and shifts in the abundance and accessibility of commercially fished species. Although many species will be negatively affected by these effects, others may expand their range or exploit new niches. OMZ shoaling is thus likely to have major and far-reaching consequences.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms play an important role in the biogeochemistry of the ocean surface layer, but spatial and temporal structures in the distributions of specific bacterioplankton species are largely unexplored, with the exceptions of those organisms that can be detected by either autofluorescence or culture methods. The use of rRNA genes as genetic markers provides a tool by which patterns in the growth, distribution, and activity of abundant bacterioplankton species can be studied regardless of the ease with which they can be cultured. Here we report an unusual cluster of related 16S rRNA genes (SAR202, SAR263, SAR279, SAR287, SAR293, SAR307) cloned from seawater collected at 250 m in the Sargasso Sea in August 1991, when the water column was highly stratified and the deep chlorophyll maximum was located at a depth of 120 m. Phylogenetic analysis and an unusual 15-bp deletion confirmed that the genes were related to the Green Non-Sulfur phylum of the domain Bacteria. This is the first evidence that representatives of this phylum occur in the open ocean. Oligonucleotide probes were used to examine the distribution of the SAR202 gene cluster in vertical profiles (0-250 m) from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and in discrete (monthly) time series (0 and 200 m) over 30 consecutive months in the Western Sargasso Sea. The data provide robust statistical support for the conclusion that the SAR202 gene cluster is proportionately most abundant at the lower boundary of the deep chlorophyll maximum (P = 2.33 x 10(-5)). These results suggest that previously unsuspected stratification of microbial populations may be a significant factor in the ecology of the ocean surface layer.},

Proteorhodopsin genes were first discovered through the cloning and sequencing of large genomic DNA fragments from seawater. They were later shown to be widely distributed, phylogenetically diverse, and active in the oceans. Proteorhodopsin genes have not been found in cultured bacteria, and on the basis of environmental sequence data, it has not yet been possible to reconstruct the genomes of uncultured bacterial strains that have proteorhodopsin genes. Although the metabolic effect of proteorhodopsins is uncertain, they are thought to function in cells for which the primary mode of metabolism is the heterotrophic assimilation of dissolved organic carbon. Here we report that SAR11 strain HTCC1062 (‘Pelagibacter ubique’), the first cultivated member of the extraordinarily abundant SAR11 clade, expresses a proteorhodopsin gene when cultured in autoclaved seawater and in its natural environment, the ocean. The Pelagibacter proteorhodopsin functions as a light-dependent proton pump. The gene is expressed by cells grown in either diurnal light or in darkness, and there is no difference between the growth rates or cell yields of cultures grown in light or darkness.},

Seasonal cycles in microbial plankton are complex, but the expansion of fixed ocean stations monitoring long-term change and the development of automated instrumentation are providing the time-series data needed to understand how these cycles vary across broad geographical scales. By accumulating data and using predictive modeling, we gain insights into changes that will occur as the ocean surface continues to warm and as the extent and duration of ocean stratification increase.

  abstract = {Recent discussion focuses on the best method for delineating microbial taxa, based on either exact sequence variants (ESVs) or traditional operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of marker gene sequences. We sought to test if the binning approach (ESVs versus 97\% OTUs) affected the ecological conclusions of a large field study. The data set included sequences targeting all bacteria (16S rRNA) and fungi (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]), across multiple environments diverging markedly in abiotic conditions, over three collection times. Despite quantitative differences in microbial richness, we found that all α and β diversity metrics were highly positively correlated (r {$>$} 0.90) between samples analyzed with both approaches. Moreover, the community composition of the dominant taxa did not vary between approaches. Consequently, statistical inferences were nearly indistinguishable. Furthermore, ESVs only moderately increased the genetic resolution of fungal and bacterial diversity (1.3 and 2.1 times OTU richness, respectively). We conclude that for broadscale (e.g., all bacteria or all fungi) α and β diversity analyses, ESV or OTU methods will often reveal similar ecological results. Thus, while there are good reasons to employ ESVs, we need not question the validity of results based on OTUs. IMPORTANCE Microbial ecologists have made exceptional improvements in our understanding of microbiomes in the last decade due to breakthroughs in sequencing technologies. These advances have wide-ranging implications for fields ranging from agriculture to human health. Due to limitations in databases, the majority of microbial ecology studies use a binning approach to approximate taxonomy based on DNA sequence similarity. There remains extensive debate on the best way to bin and approximate this taxonomy. Here we examine two popular approaches using a large field-based data set examining both bacteria and fungi and conclude that there are not major differences in the ecological outcomes. Thus, it appears that standard microbial community analyses are not overly sensitive to the particulars of binning approaches.},

We compared dissolved O2, NO−3 , NO2−, Fe and Cu concentrations with nucleic acid sequences encoding Fe and Cu-binding proteins in 21 metagenomes and 9 metatranscriptomes from Eastern Tropical North and South Pacific oxygen minimum zones and 7 metagenomes from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Station. Dissolved Fe concentrations increased sharply at upper oxic-anoxic transition zones, with the highest Fe:Cu molar ratio (1.8) occurring at the anoxic core of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific oxygen minimum zone and matching the predicted maximum ratio based on data from diverse ocean sites. The relative abundance of genes encoding Fe-binding proteins was negatively correlated with O2, driven by significant increases in genes encoding Fe-proteins involved in dissimilatory nitrogen metabolisms under anoxia. Transcripts encoding cytochrome c oxidase, the Fe- and Cu-containing terminal reductase in aerobic respiration, were positively correlated with O2 content. A comparison of the taxonomy of genes encoding Fe- and Cu-binding vs. bulk proteins in OMZs revealed that Planctomycetes represented a higher percentage of Fe genes while Thaumarchaeota represented a higher percentage of Cu genes, particularly at oxyclines. These results are broadly consistent with higher relative abundance of genes encoding Fe-proteins in the genome of a marine planctomycete vs. higher relative abundance of genes encoding Cu-proteins in the genome of a marine thaumarchaeote. These findings highlight the importance of metalloenzymes for microbial processes in oxygen minimum zones and suggest preferential Cu use in oxic habitats with Cu {$>$} Fe vs. preferential Fe use in anoxic niches with Fe {$>$} Cu.},

  abstract = {Storm-induced sediment resuspension events are examined using physical/optical sensors deployed on Slocum Gliders. Two types of storm response are found In summer, the intense seasonal stratification limits sediment resuspension even during hurricanes. In contrast, winter storm suspend sediment throughout the full water column. The fall transition between face cooling that preconditions the shelf for seasons starts with sur mixing during fall storms. Focusing on a classic fall northeaster, sediment resuspension was limited to below the weakening pycnocline early in the storm. After the pycnocline was eroded, particles immediately filled the water column. The optical signals suggest that suspended particles are likely similar materials, which implies the reduced slope of the backscatter profiles is caused by an increase in vertical transport or turbulent mixing. Wave bottom orbital velocities during this time were decreasing, and glider vertical velocities show no indication of enhanced vertical velocities reflecting full water column Langmuir cells. We conclude lite enhanced mixing is related to the interaction of the surface and bottom boundry layers as the stratification is eroded, and the observed variability is associated with the tide.},

  abstract = {The genus Prorocentrum includes six planktonic species that form high-biomass blooms, and at least nine predominantly benthic toxigenic species. Four of the plankters, including P. minimum, the only plankter reported to be toxigenic, are among the most commonly recognized harmful algae that are increasing in frequency, duration, and magnitude globally. Culture studies suggest a species group that generally grows maximally at inorganic nutrient N:P ratios just below Redfield proportions. However, field studies indicate that planktonic Prorocentrum species bloom when nutrients are at high N:P ratios relative to Redfield proportions. In the benthic species P. lima complex, toxin production has been shown to be inversely related to nutrient limitation, increasing when nutrient ratios are above Redfield proportions. Mixotrophy and allelopathy can play an important role in the interactions among planktonic Prorocentrum species, diatoms and other dinoflagellates, but little information is available for benthic taxa. The available information suggests that there are allelopathic interactions among benthic species and other algae, and that benthic species also can adversely affect finfish and shellfish health. While high growth rates may allow these plankters to initiate blooms, adaptive physiology is hypothesized to allow blooms to be maintained at less than maximal growth rates and at non-optimal N:P ratios. Given the projection for land-based nutrient export to continue to increase, it is expected that there will be further expansion of planktonic harmful Prorocentrum spp. globally and more intensive or more toxic benthic occurrences in the future.},

POC raining through the ?twilight zone? (euphotic depth to 1~km) and ?midnight zone? (1~km to 4~km) is remineralized back to inorganic form through respiration. Accurately modeling POC flux is critical for understanding the ?biological pump? and its impacts on air?sea CO2 exchange and, ultimately, long?term ocean carbon sequestration. Yet commonly used parameterizations have not been tested quantitatively against global data sets using identical modeling frameworks. Here we use a single one?dimensional physical?biogeochemical modeling framework to assess three common POC flux parameterizations in capturing POC flux observations from moored sediment traps and thorium?234 depletion. The exponential decay, Martin curve, and ballast model are compared to data from 11 biogeochemical provinces distributed across the globe. In each province, the model captures satellite?based estimates of surface primary production within uncertainties. Goodness of fit is measured by how well the simulation captures the observations, quantified by bias and the root?mean?square error and displayed using ?target diagrams.? Comparisons are presented separately for the twilight zone and midnight zone. We find that the ballast hypothesis shows no improvement over a globally or regionally parameterized Martin curve. For all provinces taken together, Martin's b that best fits the data is [0.70, 0.98]; this finding reduces by at least a factor of 3 previous estimates of potential impacts on atmospheric pCO2 of uncertainty in POC export to a more modest range [?16~ppm, +12~ppm].},

Although richness over depth layers or sampling dates greatly varied (∼30 and 70-80\% new operational taxonomic units (OTU) between two samples with ARISA and MPTS, respectively), overall patterns of community variations were similar with both approaches. Alpha-diversity estimated by ARISA-derived OTU was most similar to that obtained from MPTS-derived OTU defined at the order level. Similar patterns of OTU replacement were also found with MPTS at the family level and with 20-25\% rare types removed. Using ARISA or MPTS data sets with lower resolution, such as those containing only resident OTU, yielded a similar set of significant contextual variables explaining bacterial community changes. Hence, ARISA as a rapid and low-cost fingerprinting technique represents a valid starting point for more in-depth exploration of community composition, when complemented by the detailed taxonomic description offered by MPTS.},

Fragmentation of these particles into more slowly sinking daughter particles has been proposed previously to partly explain the rapid loss of sinking carbon below the mixed layer. In this study we investigated 2 other less obvious potential consequences of aggregate disruption, namely the release of dissolved interstitial compounds upon fragmentation and accelerated degradation due to increased particle surface area. We found that upon fragmentation natural marine aggregates, ranging in size from 3 to 6 mm diameter, released dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (mean 0.12 μmol aggregate–1) and nitrate (mean of 0.013 μmol aggregate–1) into surrounding seawater, making these nutrients available to free-living biota. Filtration of whole aggregates failed to result in an equivalent release, suggesting that marine snow may not be as leaky as expected based on high aggregate porosity. Decomposition of aggregate particulate organic carbon (POC) to DOC was similar for whole and fragmented aggregates ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 μmol POC aggregate–1 d–1, resulting in calculated aggregate POC turnover times of 2 to 11 d. Remineralization of DOC was also similar for both aggregate treatments and suggested a tight coupling between solubilization and uptake by attached bacteria. Our results indicate that the longer residence times predicted for smaller aggregates in the mixed layer, rather than changes in decomposition rate, may be the most influential impact of aggregate fragmentation on reduction of particle flux to depth.},

  abstract = {Accumulating evidence points to the importance of mesoscale eddies in supplying nutrients to surface waters in oligotrophic gyres. However, the nature of the biological response and its evolution over time has yet to be elucidated. Changes in mesozooplankton community composition due to eddy perturbation also could affect biogeochemical cycling. Over the course of two summers we sampled seven eddies in the Sargasso Sea. We focused on and followed a post-phytoplankton bloom cyclonic eddy (C1) in 2004 and a blooming mode-water anticyclonic eddy (A4) in 2005. We collected zooplankton in all eddies using a Multiple Opening and Closing Net Environmental Sampling System (MOCNESS) and quantified biomass (\&gt;0.15 mm, in five size fractions) from 0 to 700 m over nine discrete depth intervals. Zooplankton biomass (\&gt;0.5 mm) in the upper 150 m was similarly enhanced at night for the periphery of C1 and the center of A4 at 0.514 g m−2 and 0.533 g m−2, respectively, compared to outside (0.183 g m−2 outside C1 and 0.197 g m−2 outside A4). Despite minimal chlorophyll a enhancement and dominance by picoplankton in C1, zooplankton biomass increased most for the largest size class (\&gt;5 mm). Gut fluorescence for euphausiids and large copepods was also elevated on the C1 periphery. In A4, peak biomass occurred at eddy center coincident with peak primary production, but was highly variable (changing by \&gt;3-fold) over time, perhaps resulting from the dense, but patchy distribution of diatom chains in this region. Shifts in zooplankton community composition and abundance were reflected in enhancement of fecal pellet production and active transport by diel vertical migration in eddies. Inside C1 the flux of zooplankton fecal pellets at 150 m in June 2004 was 1.5-fold higher than outside the eddy, accounting for 9\% of total particulate organic carbon (POC) flux. The flux of fecal pellets (mostly from copepods) increased through the summer in eddy A4, matching concurrent increases in zooplankton \&lt;2 mm in length, and accounting for up to 12\% of total POC flux. Active carbon transport by vertically migrating zooplankton was 37\% higher on the periphery of C1 and 74\% higher at the center of A4 compared to the summer mean at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) station. Despite contrasting responses by the phytoplankton community to cyclonic and mode-water eddies, mesozooplankton biomass was similarly enhanced, possibly due to differential physical and biological aggregation mechanisms, and resulted in important zooplankton-mediated changes in mesoscale biogeochemistry.},

  abstract = {Sinking of marine snow is a major mechanism of particulate carbon transport from surface waters to the seafloor. Any process altering the abundance or size of marine snow influences carbon flux and food availability to pelagic and benthic organisms. We explored whether zooplankton can alter carbon transport by a new mechanism—physical fragmentation of marine snow. The fluid stress created around the appendages of swimming Euphausia pacifica is capable of fragmenting a single aggregate into multiple, smaller aggregates. The reduced size and slower sinking rate of the daughter aggregates may increase their residence time in the water column, promoting decomposition and decreasing particle flux to depth. To determine the importance of fragmentation, tethered and free-swimming euphausiids were videotaped in the presence of marine snow representing a range of aggregate strengths, sizes, and ages. Image analysis was used to characterize the particles prior to and following fragmentation and to determine the area of influence around a single euphausiid. Tethered euphausiids pulled in particles from an average of 6.7 mm away, and most aggregates were fragmented in either the region of the rapidly beating pleopods or in the high-velocity jet that forms off the tail. Euphausiids were capable of fragmenting all aggregate types and produced an average of 7.3 daughter particles, with 60\% of these daughter particles remaining within the marine snow size class ({$>$}0.5 mm). Thus, physical fragmentation by swimming euphausiids increases the abundance of marine snow while decreasing overall marine snow mass. This novel process, which alters particle size structure without loss of total particulate organic carbon (POC), will be important in upwelling regions where euphausiids are the dominant macrozooplankton migrators.},

The rate at which new, low-cost, high-throughput -omic technologies are being developed has also led to an expansion in the number of studies aimed at gaining a better understanding of disease processes in bivalves. This review provides a catalogue of the genetic and -omic tools available for bivalve species and examples of how -omics has contributed to the advancement of marine bivalve disease research, with a special focus in the areas of immunity, bivalve–pathogen interactions, mechanisms of disease resistance and pathogen virulence, and disease diagnosis. The analysis of bivalve genomes and transcriptomes has revealed that many immune and stress-related gene families are expanded in the bivalve taxa examined thus far. In addition, the analysis of proteomes confirms that responses to infection are influenced by epigenetic, post-transcriptional, and post-translational modifications. The few studies performed in bivalves show that epigenetic modifications are non-random, suggesting a role for epigenetics in regulating the interactions between bivalves and their environments. Despite the progress -omic tools have enabled in the field of marine bivalve disease processes, there is much more work to be done. To date, only three bivalve genomes have been sequenced completely, with assembly status at different levels of completion. Transcriptome datasets are relatively easy and inexpensive to generate, but their interpretation will benefit greatly from high quality genome assemblies and improved data analysis pipelines. Finally, metagenomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies focused on bivalve disease processes are currently limited but their expansion should be facilitated as more transcriptome datasets and complete genome sequences become available for marine bivalve species.},

Their discovery within genomic material from uncultivated marine bacterioplankton caused considerable excitement because it indicated a potential phototrophic function within these organisms, which had previously been considered strictly chemotrophic. Subsequent studies established that sequences encoding proteorhodopsin are broadly distributed throughout the world’s oceans. Nevertheless, the role of proteorhodopsins in native marine bacteria is still unknown. Here we show, from an analysis of the complete genomes of three marine Flavobacteria, that cultivated bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes, one of the principal components of marine bacterioplankton, contain proteorhodopsin. Moreover, growth experiments in both natural and artificial seawater (low in labile organic matter, which is typical of the world’s oceans) establish that exposure to light results in a marked increase in the cell yield of one such bacterium (Dokdonia sp. strain MED134) when compared with cells grown in darkness.

  abstract = {During aerobic respiration, microorganisms consume oxygen (O2) through the use of different types of terminal oxidases which have a wide range of affinities for O2. The Km values for O2 of these enzymes have been determined to be in the range of 3 to 200 nmol liter(-1). In this study, we examined the time course of development of aerobic respiratory kinetics of four marine bacterial species (Dinoroseobacter shibae, Roseobacter denitrificans, Idiomarina loihiensis, and Marinobacter daepoensis) during exposure to decreasing O2 concentrations. The genomes of all four species have genes for both high-affinity and low-affinity terminal oxidases. The respiration rate of the bacteria was measured by the use of extremely sensitive optical trace O2 sensors (range, 1 to 1,000 nmol liter(-1)). Three of the four isolates exhibited apparent Km values of 30 to 60 nmol liter(-1) when exposed to submicromolar O2 concentrations, but a decrease to values below 10 nmol liter(-1) was observed when the respiration rate per cell was lowered and the cell size was decreased due to starvation. The fourth isolate did not reach a low respiration rate per cell during starvation and exhibited apparent Km values of about 20 nmol liter(-1) throughout the experiment. The results clearly demonstrate not only that enzyme kinetics may limit O2 uptake but also that even individual cells may be diffusion limited and that this diffusion limitation is the most pronounced at high respiration rates. A decrease in cell size by starvation, due to limiting organic carbon, and thereby more efficient diffusion uptake may also contribute to lower apparent Km values.},

  abstract = {A new method is presented for determining the flocculation time of monodispersed sediment suspensions. Flocculation time is the critical time at which abrupt changes in the particle size spectrum of an aggregative suspension occurs. This method predicts flocculation times to within 6\% of values predicted by a geometric sectional aggregation model (Batterham, R.J., Hall, J.S. and Barton, G., 1981. In: Proceedings, 3rd International Symposium on Agglomeration, Nürnberg, Federal Republic of Germany, pp. A136–A150) but uses only a fraction of the computational effort. Flocculation times estimated in this way are superior to estimates of flocculation time scale made using half-life because particle geometry and differential settling encounter are taken into account. The proposed model is based on typical size distributions calculated using the Batterham et al. model. These size distributions have approximately equal mass in geometrically increasing size classes, i.e. they are Junge-dispersed. By assuming that the suspension remains Junge-dispersed throughout its evolution, the system of differential equations required to describe the suspension reduces to a single differential equation. Flocculation times are calculated for three values of maximum floc size (dmax=\{10,1,0.1mm\}), a maximum settling velocity of ws=1mms-1, and a variety of initial conditions. For a given set of inputs, flocculation times calculated in this way are linearly related to those calculated using the Batterham et al. model, but the slope of the relationship varies with fractal dimension. Multiple linear regression equations are developed to directly relate the two. The effect of including sinking losses into the Batterham et al. model is also investigated. If the sinking loss time scale is much longer than the flocculation time, then the suspension becomes flocculated at roughly the same time it would have had there been no sinking losses, and the new method can be used. Conversely, if the sinking time scale is less than or equal to the flocculation time, then the new method cannot be used.},

  abstract = {The small average cell size of in situ bacterioplankton, relative to cultured cells, has been suggested to be at least partly a result of selection of larger-sized cells by bacterivorous protozoa. In this study, we determined the relative rates of uptake of fluorescence-labeled bacteria (FLB), of various cell sizes and cell types, by natural assemblages of flagellates and ciliates in estuarine water. Calculated clearance rates of bacterivorous flagellates had a highly significant, positive relationship with size of FLB, over a range of average biovolume of FLB of 0.03 to 0.08 microns3. Bacterial cell type or cell shape per se did not appear to affect flagellate clearance rates. The dominant size classes of flagellates which ingested all types of FLB were 3- to 4-microns cells. Ciliates also showed a general preference for larger-sized bacteria. However, ciliates ingested a gram-positive enteric bacterium and a marine bacterial isolate at higher rates than they did a similarly sized, gram-negative enteric bacterium or natural bacterioplankton, respectively. From the results of an experiment designed to test whether the addition of a preferentially grazed bacterial strain stimulated clearance rates of natural bacterioplankton FLB by the ciliates, we hypothesized that measured differences in rates of FLB uptake were due instead to differences in effective retention of bacteria by the ciliates. In general, clearance rates for different FLB varied by a factor of 2 to 4. Selective grazing by protozoa of larger bacterioplankton cells, which are generally the cells actively growing or dividing, may in part explain the small average cell size, low frequency of dividing cells, and low growth rates generally observed for assemblages of suspended bacteria.},

The latitudinal transect was carried out at 17 stations along the 180° meridian from 8°S to 8°N during a cold phase of El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Higher MS concentrations were found below the equatorial zone than poleward. At the equator the estimated integrated MS carbon m−2 in the upper kilometer was 5.7 g m−2, while both southward and northward (between 1° and 8°) the mean integrated MS carbon was about 2.7 g. m−2. In the upper 50 m the MS carbon was twofold lower than the combined carbon of autotrophic and heterotrophic protists and four times lower than the mesozooplankton carbon biomass, both measured concurrently during the cruise. Different water bodies had different MS content. The highest concentrations were found in the South Equatorial Current, the South Equatorial Counter Current, and the North Equatorial Countercurrent. Tropical waters at the south in the South Subsurface Countercurrents and the warm northern superficial waters had the lowest MS biomass. Mechanistically, a latitudinal “conveyor belt”, a poleward divergence of upwelled waters that return to the equator after being downwelled at north and south convergent zones, may partially explain the vertical distribution of particulate matter observed during the studied period.},

  abstract = {The introduction of nonnative oysters (i.e., Crassostrea ariakensis) into the Chesapeake Bay has been proposed as necessary for the restoration of the oyster industry; however, nothing is known about the public health risks related to contamination of these oysters with human pathogens. Commercial market-size C. ariakensis triploids were maintained in large marine tanks with water of low (8-ppt), medium (12-ppt), and high (20-ppt) salinities spiked with 1.0 × 105 transmissive stages of the following human pathogens: Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, Giardia lamblia cysts, and microsporidian spores (i.e., Encephalitozoon intestinalis, Encephalitozoon hellem, and Enterocytozoon bieneusi). Viable oocysts and spores were still detected in oysters on day 33 post-water inoculation (pwi), and cysts were detected on day 14 pwi. The recovery, bioaccumulation, depuration, and inactivation rates of human waterborne pathogens by C. ariakensis triploids were driven by salinity and were optimal in medium- and high-salinity water. The concentration of human pathogens from ambient water by C. ariakensis and the retention of these pathogens without (or with minimal) inactivation and a very low depuration rate provide evidence that these oysters may present a public health threat upon entering the human food chain, if harvested from polluted water. This conclusion is reinforced by the concentration of waterborne pathogens used in the present study, which was representative of levels of infectious agents in surface waters, including the Chesapeake Bay. Aquacultures of nonnative oysters in the Chesapeake Bay will provide excellent ecological services in regard to efficient cleaning of human-infectious agents from the estuarine waters.},

  abstract = {Vibrio spp. have been a persistent concern for coastal bivalve hatcheries, which are vulnerable to environmental pathogens in the seawater used for rearing larvae, yet the biogeochemical drivers of oyster-pathogenic Vibrio spp. in their planktonic state are poorly understood. Here, we present data tracking oyster-pathogenic Vibrio bacteria in Netarts Bay and Yaquina Bay in Oregon, USA, as well as in adjacent coastal waters and a local shellfish hatchery, through the 2015 upwelling season. Vibrio populations were quantified using a culture-independent approach of high-throughput Vibrio-specific 16S rRNA gene sequencing paired with droplet digital PCR, and abundances were analyzed in the context of local biogeochemistry. The most abundant putative pathogen in our samples was Vibrio coralliilyticus. Environmental concentrations of total Vibrio spp. and V. coralliilyticus were highest in Netarts Bay sediment samples and higher in seawater from Netarts Bay than from nearshore coastal waters or Yaquina Bay. In Netarts Bay, the highest V. coralliilyticus concentrations were observed during low tide, and abundances increased throughout the summer. We hypothesize that the warm shallow waters in estuarine mudflats facilitate the local growth of the V. coralliilyticus pathogen. Samples from larval oyster tanks in Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery, which uses seawater pumped directly from Netarts Bay, contained significantly lower total Vibrio species concentrations, but roughly similar V. coralliilyticus concentrations, than did the bay water, resulting in a 30-fold increase in the relative abundance of the V. coralliilyticus pathogen in hatchery tanks. This suggests that the V. coralliilyticus pathogen is able to grow or persist under hatchery conditions. IMPORTANCE It has been argued that oyster-pathogenic Vibrio spp. have contributed to recent mortality events in U.S. shellfish hatcheries (R. A. Elston, H. Hasegawa, K. L. Humphrey, I. K. Polyak, and C. Häse, Dis Aquat Organ 82:119–134, 2008, https://doi.org/10.3354/dao01982); however, these events are often sporadic and unpredictable. The success of hatcheries is critically linked to the chemical and biological composition of inflowing seawater resources; thus, it is pertinent to understand the biogeochemical drivers of oyster-pathogenic Vibrio spp. in their planktonic state. Here, we show that Netarts Bay, the location of a local hatchery, is enriched in oyster-pathogenic V. coralliilyticus compared to coastal seawater, and we hypothesize that conditions in tidal flats promote the local growth of this pathogen. Furthermore, V. coralliilyticus appears to persist in seawater pumped into the local hatchery. These results improve our understanding of the ecology and environmental controls of the V. coralliilyticus pathogen and could be used to improve future aquaculture efforts, as multiple stressors impact hatchery success.},

  abstract = {Environmental nutrient enrichment from human agricultural and waste runoff could cause changes to microbial communities that allow them to capitalize on newly available resources. Currently, the response of microbial communities to nutrient enrichment remains poorly understood, and, while some studies have shown no clear changes in community composition in response to heavy nutrient loading, others targeting specific genes have demonstrated clear impacts. In this study, we compared functional metagenomic profiles from sediment samples taken along two salt marsh creeks, one of which was exposed for more than 40 years to treated sewage effluent at its head. We identified strong and consistent increases in the relative abundance of microbial genes related to each of the biochemical steps in the denitrification pathway at enriched sites. Despite fine-scale local increases in the abundance of denitrification-related genes, the overall community structures based on broadly defined functional groups and taxonomic annotations were similar and varied with other environmental factors, such as salinity, which were common to both creeks. Homology-based taxonomic assignments of nitrous oxide reductase sequences in our data show that increases are spread over a broad taxonomic range, thus limiting detection from taxonomic data alone. Together, these results illustrate a functionally targeted yet taxonomically broad response of microbial communities to anthropogenic nutrient loading, indicating some resolution to the apparently conflicting results of existing studies on the impacts of nutrient loading in sediment communities.},

  abstract = {The native Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, was once abundant in many US Pacific Northwest (PNW) estuaries, but was decimated by human activity in the late nineteenth early to twentieth centuries. Having been the subject of only few modern, detailed studies, a dearth of basic physiological information surrounded O. lurida and how it compared to the now dominant, non-native Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Utilizing laboratory and in situ studies in Yaquina Bay, OR, we explored the clearance rates of both species across a wide range of conditions. Pacific oysters not only had greater size-specific clearance rates than Olympia oysters, but also had a lower optimum temperature. Clearance rates for both species were reduced at lower salinity, at lower organic content, and at higher turbidity. Clearance rate models were constructed for each species using three approaches: (1) a single mechanistic model that incorporated feeding response functions of each species to the effects of temperature, salinity, turbidity, and seston organic content based on laboratory studies; (2) another additive model in which the number and type of response functions from laboratory studies were allowed to vary; and (3) a statistical model that utilized environmental data collected during in situ feeding trials. Clearance rate models that correlated feeding activity with in situ environmental data were found to often better predict oyster clearance rates (based on Adj R 2) for both species in Yaquina Bay, OR, than mechanistic, additive models based on laboratory feeding response functions; however, in situ correlative models varied in accuracy by species and season. This work represents important first steps towards better understanding the physiological ecology of the native Olympia oyster and how it differs from introduced and now dominant Pacific oyster.},

  abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA)—a process describing the ocean’s increase in dissolved carbon dioxide ( pCO2) and a reduction in pH and aragonite saturation state (Ωar) due to higher concentrations of atmospheric CO2—is considered a threat to bivalve mollusks and other marine calcifiers. While many studies have focused on the effects of OA on shell formation and growth, we present findings on the separate effects of  pCO2, Ωar, and pH on larval feeding physiology (initiation of feeding, gut fullness, and ingestion rates) of the California mussel Mytilus californianus. We found that elevated  pCO2 delays initiation of feeding, while gut fullness and ingestion rates were best predicted by Ωar; however, pH was not found to have a significant effect on these feeding processes under the range of OA conditions tested. We also modeled how OA impacts on initial shell development and how feeding physiology might subsequently affect larval energy budget components (e.g. scope for growth) and developmental rate to 260 µm shell length, a size at which larvae typically become pediveligers. Our model predicted that Ωar impacts on larval shell size and ingestion rates over the initial 48 h period of development would result in a developmental delay to the pediveliger stage of {$>$}4 d, compared with larvae initially developing in supersaturated conditions (Ωar {$>$} 1). Collectively, these results suggest that predicted increases in  pCO2 and reduced Ωar values may negatively impact feeding activity and energy balances of bivalve larvae, reducing their overall fitness and recruitment success.},

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so—and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

In the Antarctic, the reductions were accompanied by increased wind stress. Three of four low latitude basins exhibited decadal increases in annual primary production.

A coupled three-dimensional general circulation, biogeochemical, and radiative model of the global oceans was validated using these in situ data sources and satellite data sets. Biogeochemical processes in the model were determined from the influences of circulation and turbulence dynamics, irradiance availability, and the interactions among four phytoplankton functional groups (diatoms, chlorophytes, cyanobacteria, and coccolithophores) and four nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, silica, and dissolved iron). Annual mean log-transformed dissolved iron concentrations in the model were statistically positively correlated on basin scale with observations (P{$<$}0.05) over the eight (out of 12) major oceanographic basins where data were available. The model tended to overestimate in situ observations, except in the Antarctic where a large underestimate occurred. Inadequate scavenging and excessive remineralization and/or regeneration were possible reasons for the overestimation. Basin scale model chlorophyll seasonal distributions were positively correlated with SeaWiFS chlorophyll in each of the 12 oceanographic basins (P{$<$}0.05). The global mean difference was 3.9\% (model higher than SeaWiFS). The four phytoplankton groups were initialized as homogeneous and equal distributions throughout the model domain. After 26 years of simulation, they arrived at reasonable distributions throughout the global oceans: diatoms predominated high latitudes, coastal, and equatorial upwelling areas, cyanobacteria predominated the mid-ocean gyres, and chlorophytes and coccolithophores represented transitional assemblages. Seasonal patterns exhibited a range of relative responses: from a seasonal succession in the North Atlantic with coccolithophores replacing diatoms as the dominant group in mid-summer, to successional patterns with cyanobacteria replacing diatoms in mid-summer in the central North Pacific. Diatoms were associated with regions where nutrient availability was high. Cyanobacteria predominated in quiescent regions with low nutrients. While the overall patterns of phytoplankton functional group distributions exhibited broad qualitative agreement with in situ data, quantitative comparisons were mixed. Three of the four phytoplankton groups exhibited statistically significant correspondence across basins. Diatoms did not. Some basins exhibited excellent correspondence, while most showed moderate agreement, with two functional groups in agreement with data and the other two in disagreement. The results are encouraging for a first attempt at simulating functional groups in a global coupled three-dimensional model but many issues remain.},

When the definition of success in organism discovery is measured by sequence diversity and evolutionary distance, RNA viruses win. This review explores the history of RNA virus metagenomics, reasons for the successes so far in RNA virus metagenomics, and methodological concerns. In addition, the review briefly covers clinical metagenomics and environmental metagenomics and highlights some of the critical accomplishments that have defined the fast pace of RNA virus discoveries in recent years.

  abstract = {Despite recognition of the importance of soil bacteria to terrestrial ecosystem functioning there is little consensus on the factors regulating belowground biodiversity. Here we present a multi-scale spatial assessment of soil bacterial community profiles across Great Britain ({$>~$}1000 soil cores), and show the first landscape scale map of bacterial distributions across a nation. Bacterial diversity and community dissimilarities, assessed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, were most strongly related to soil pH providing a large-scale confirmation of the role of pH in structuring bacterial taxa. However, while α diversity was positively related to pH, the converse was true for β diversity (between sample variance in α diversity). β diversity was found to be greatest in acidic soils, corresponding with greater environmental heterogeneity. Analyses of clone libraries revealed the pH effects were predominantly manifest at the level of broad bacterial taxonomic groups, with acidic soils being dominated by few taxa (notably the group 1 Acidobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria). We also noted significant correlations between bacterial communities and most other measured environmental variables (soil chemistry, aboveground features and climatic variables), together with significant spatial correlations at close distances. In particular, bacterial and plant communities were closely related signifying no strong evidence that soil bacteria are driven by different ecological processes to those governing higher organisms. We conclude that broad scale surveys are useful in identifying distinct soil biomes comprising reproducible communities of dominant taxa. Together these results provide a baseline ecological framework with which to pursue future research on both soil microbial function, and more explicit biome based assessments of the local ecological drivers of bacterial biodiversity.},

To decrease research misconduct, the emphasis has been on education aimed at promoting an understanding of and commitment to research integrity. To decrease the impact of conflict of interest, the emphasis has been on management of the research environment. In this essay I discuss the idea that research misconduct and its close relative “questionable research practices” should be framed in the context of conflict of interest. If we take seriously the implication of conflict of interest regulations that even a \$5,000 financial interest might bias the design, conduct, or reporting of research, then how much more risk of bias will be in play when what is at stake is ongoing funding of short-term research grants on which a researcher’s salary and job depend? Education is important and necessary to promote research integrity but by itself will not be sufficient. Placing problems of research misconduct and questionable research practices in the context of conflict of interest makes it clear that we also will need to develop new approaches to manage the structure of the research environment. One example of such a management strategy would be for NIH to phase in a limit on the overall percentage of a faculty member’s salary permitted to be supported with NIH grant funds, complementing the already existing upper dollar limit that can be used for faculty salaries.},

In an earlier study, we showed that the initial colonization of model particles by individual bacterial strains isolated from marine aggregates was a function of attachment and detachment. In the present study, we have investigated how this colonization process was further affected by growth and interspecific interactions among the bacteria. Long-term incubation experiments showed that growth dominated over attachment and detachment after a few hours in controlling the bacterial population density on agar particles. In the absence of grazing mortality, this growth led to an equilibrium population density consistent with the theoretical limit due to oxygen diffusion. Interspecific interaction experiments showed that the presence of some bacterial strains (“residents”) on the agar particles either increased or decreased the colonization rate of other strains (“newcomers”). Comparison between an antibiotic-producing strain and its antibiotic-free mutant showed no inhibitory effect on the newcomers due to antibiotic production. On the contrary, hydrolytic activity of the antibiotic-producing strain appeared to benefit the newcomers and enhance their colonization rate. These results show that growth- and species-specific interactions have to be taken into account to adequately describe bacterial colonization of marine particles. Changes in colonization pattern due to such small-scale processes may have profound effects on the transformation and fluxes of particulate matter in the ocean.},

We conducted laboratory experiments to compare cell-specific bacterial protein production (BPP) and protease activity between free-living and attached bacteria. Natural bacterial assemblages attached to model aggregates (agar spheres) had threefold higher BPP and two orders of magnitude higher protease activity than their free-living counterpart. These observations could be explained by preferential colonization of the agar spheres by bacteria with inherently higher metabolic activity and/or individual bacteria increasing their metabolism upon attachment to surfaces. In subsequent experiments, we used four strains of marine snow bacteria isolates to test the hypothesis that bacteria could up- and down-regulate their metabolism while on and off an aggregate. The protease activity of attached bacteria was 10-20 times higher than that of free-living bacteria, indicating that the individual strains could increase their protease activity within a short time (2 h) upon attachment to surfaces. Agar spheres with embedded diatom cells were colonized faster than plain agar spheres and the attached bacteria were clustered around the agar-embedded diatom cells, indicating a chemosensing response. Increased protease activity and BPP allow attached bacteria to quickly exploit aggregate resources upon attachment, which may accelerate remineralization of marine snow and reduce the downward carbon fluxes.},

  abstract = {Macroscopic aggregates (marine snow) contribute to new production and nutrient dynamics in the upper ocean and vertical fluxes of organic matter to the deep ocean. To test whether microorganisms play a significant role in phytoplankton aggregate formation we studied particle abundance and size as well as abundance, colonization behaviour, and community composition of bacteria during the growth of 2 marine diatoms (Thalassiosira weissflogii and Navicula sp.) under axenic and non-axenic conditions. Community composition of free-living and attached bacteria during phytoplankton growth and aggregation was studied by amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Our results show that the presence of bacteria was a prerequisite for aggregation of T. weissflogii but not of Navicula sp. Occurrences of distinct populations of free-living and attached bacteria depended on phytoplankton growth and aggregation dynamics. The community composition of especially attached bacteria significantly differed between the 2 algal cultures. Our study suggests that phytoplankton aggregation and vertical fluxes are closely linked to interactions between the marine phytoplankton and the ambient microbial community.},

However, despite their ecological importance, viruses inhabiting many echinoderms, cnidarians, urochordates, and marine arthropods have not been investigated with significant breadth. We conducted a broad survey of the viral assemblages inhabiting these hosts through viral metagenomics and phylogenetic analysis. Results indicate that different invertebrate groups harbor distinct viral assemblages. Interestingly, however, no significant difference is observed between the viral assemblages of echinoderms and arthropods. These similarities and differences may be due to cellular, immunological, geographical, and ecological differences amongst host phyla, although mechanistic determination is beyond the purview of this work. Additionally, we present evidence of the detection of several viral families that have not yet been observed in these hosts. Finally, we confirm the result of previous investigation that method of library construction significantly biases metagenomic results by altering the representation of of ssDNA and dsDNA viral genomes.},

High viral loads are found at the sewage pipeline or at the entrance of wastewater treatment plants from cities where the number of COVID-19 cases are significant. In Quito (Ecuador) as in many other cities worldwide, wastewater is directly discharged into natural waters. The aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 presence in urban streams from a low sanitation context. Three river locations along the urban rivers of Quito were sampled on the 5th of June during a peak of COVID-19 cases. River samples were evaluated for water quality parameters and afterwards, concentrated for viral analysis using skimmed milk flocculation method. The viral concentrates were quantified for SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 target regions) and Human Adenovirus as a human viral indicator. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected for both target regions in all samples analyzed in a range of 2,91E+05 to 3,19E+06 GC/L for N1 and from 2,07E+05 to 2,22E+06 GC/L for N2. The high values detected in natural waters from a low sanitation region have several implications in health and ecology that should be further assessed.},

  abstract = {The use of echo-levels from Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) recordings has become more and more common for estimating suspended bed-material and wash loads in rivers over the last decade. Empirical, semi-empirical and physical-based acoustic methods have been applied in different case studies, which provided relationships between scattering particles features derived from samples (i.e., concentration and grain size) and corresponding backscattering strength and sound attenuation. These methods entail different assumptions regarding sediment heterogeneity in the ensonified volume (e.g., particle size distribution (PSD) and spatial concentration gradient). Our work was to compare acoustic backscatter and attenuation properties of suspended sediments, sampled in the rivers Parana and Danube that represented rather different hydro-sedimentological conditions during the surveys. The Parana represents a large sandy river, characterized through a huge watershed and the typical bimodal PSD of sediment in suspension, while the Danube represents in the investigated reach an exposed sand-gravel bed and clay-silt particles transported in the water column in suspension. Sand and clay-silt concentrations clearly dominate the analyzed backscattering strength in the rivers Parana and Danube, respectively, with an effect of PSD level of sorting in the latter case. This comparison clarifies the extent of assumptions made, eventually advising on the actual possibility of applying certain ADCP methods, depending on the expected concentration gradients and PSD of suspended sediment to be investigated.},

  abstract = {We recorded vertical profiles of size distributions of large particles ({$<$}100 µm) to a 1000-m depth in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and in the Mediterranean Sea with the Underwater Video Profiler. Of the 410 profiles used in our analysis, 193 also included temperature, salinity, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-resolved pigments, which were used to characterize the size structure of the phytoplankton community. Classification analysis identified six clusters of vertical profiles of size distributions of particles. Each cluster was characterized by the size distribution of its particles in the mesopelagic layer and the change of the particle-size distribution with depth. Clusters with large particles in the mesopelagic layer corresponded to surface waters dominated by microphytoplankton, and those with small particles corresponded to surface waters dominated by picophytoplankton. We estimated the mass flux at 400 m using a relationship between particle size and mass flux. Principal-component regression analysis showed that 68\% of the variance of the mass flux at 400 m was explained by the size structure of the phytoplankton community and integrated chlorophyll a in the euphotic zone. We found that coefficient k in the Martin power relationship, which describes the decrease in the vertical mass flux with depth, varies between 0.2 and 1.0 in the world ocean, and we provided an empirical relationship to derive k from the size structure of phytoplankton biomass in the euphotic zone. Biogeochemists and modelers could use that relationship to obtain a realistic description of the downward particle flux instead of using a constant k value as often done.},

While the intensity of the pump correlates with plankton community composition, the underlying ecosystem structure driving the process remains largely uncharacterized. Here we use environmental and metagenomic data gathered during the Tara Oceans expedition to improve our understanding of carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean. We show that specific plankton communities, from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum, correlate with carbon export at 150 m and highlight unexpected taxa such as Radiolaria and alveolate parasites, as well as Synechococcus and their phages, as lineages most strongly associated with carbon export in the subtropical, nutrient-depleted, oligotrophic ocean. Additionally, we show that the relative abundance of a few bacterial and viral genes can predict a significant fraction of the variability in carbon export in these regions.},

  abstract = {Large aggregates commonly named “marine snow” are difficult to collect and study because of their fragile nature, but they make up the largest fraction of vertical carbon flux in the ocean. Developments in imaging sensors and computer systems have facilitated the development of in situ image acquisition systems that can be used to produce profiles of aggregate size distribution and abundance. However, it is difficult to collect information on the different properties of particles, such as their composition, from in situ images. In this paper, we relate sediment trap data to particle size (d) distributions to estimate the vertical fluxes (F) of mass, particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) using simple power relationships ( F = A d b ). Mean aggregate fractal dimension of 2.3 and a size-dependent settling speed are determined from the flux estimations. We have used these relationships to map the distribution of mass flux along 180°W in the equatorial Pacific. Similar mass fluxes below the euphotic zone have been reported along 150°W for the same period with conventional sediment traps, supporting the accuracy of these relationships. The high spatial resolution of sedimentation processes studied in situ with the Underwater Video Profiler allowed us to undertake a detailed study of the role of physical processes in vertical fluxes.},

The effect of freshwater inflow on NO3 − loading and hypoxia was also examined to characterize its effect at internannual and longer time scales. Year to year variability in river flow accounted for some of the observed changes in hypoxic volume, but the long-term increase was not due to increased river flow. From 1950–2001, the volume of hypoxic water in mid summer increased substantially and at an accelerating rate. Predicted anoxic volume (DO{$<$}0.2 mg I−1) at average river flow increased from zero in 1950 to 3.6×109 m3 in 2001. Severe hypoxia (DO{$<$}1.0 mg I−1) increased from 1.6×109 to 6.5×109 m3 over the same period, while mild hypoxia (DO{$<$}2.0 mg I−1) increased from 3.4×109 to 9.2×109 m3. NO3 − concentrations in the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, increased up to 3-fold from 1945 to a 1989 maximum and declined through 2001. On a decadal average basis, the superposition of changes in river flow on the long-term increase in NO3 − resulted in a 2-fold increase in NO3 − loading from the Susquehanna River during the 1960s to 1970s. Decadal average loads were subsequently stable through the 1990s. Hypoxia was positively correlated with NO3 − loading, but more extensive hypoxia was observed in recent years than would be expected from the observed relationship. The results suggested that the Bay may have become more susceptible to NO3 − loading. To eliminate or greatly reduce anoxia will require reducing average annual total nitrogen loading to the Maryland mainstem Bay to 50×106 kg yr−1, a reduction of 40\% from recent levels.},

Some taxa have shown a pronounced morphological plasticity and demonstrated complete or partial shifts in size distribution to larger growth forms (filaments, microcolonies). However, other taxa with weak plasticity have shown no ability to reduce grazing mortality through changes in size. The impact of protistan grazing on bacterial communities is based on the complex interplay of several parameters. These include grazing selectivity (by size and other features), differences in sensitivity of bacterial species to grazing, differences in responses of single bacterial populations to grazing (size and physiology), as well as the direct and indirect influence of grazing on bacterial growth conditions (substrate supply) and bacterial competition (elimination of competitors).},

  abstract = {Sediment and water samples from nine stations in Chesapeake Bay were examined for tin content and for microbial populations resistant to inorganic tin (75 mg of Sn liter−1 as SnCl4·5H2O) or to the organotin compound dimethyltin chloride [15 mg of Sn liter−1 as (CH3)2SnCl2]. Tin concentrations in sediments were higher (3.0 to 7.9 mg kg−1) at sites impacted by human activity than at open water sites (0.8 to 0.9 mg kg−1), and they were very high (239.6 mg kg−1) in Baltimore Harbor, which is impacted by both shipping and heavy industry. Inorganic tin (75 mg Sn liter−1) in agar medium significantly decreased viable counts, but its toxicity was markedly reduced in liquid medium; it was not toxic in medium solidified with silica gel. Addition of SnCl4·5H2O to these media produced a tin precipitate which was not involved in the metal's toxicity. The data suggest that a soluble tin-agar complex which is toxic to cells is formed in agar medium. Thus, the toxicity of tin depends more on the chemical species than on the metal concentration in the medium. All sites in Chesapeake Bay contained organisms resistant to tin. The microbial flora was more sensitive to (CH3)2SnCl2 than to SnCl4·5H2O. The elevated level of tin-resistant microorganisms in some aeas not containing unusually high tin concentrations suggests that factors other than tin may participate in the selection for a tin-tolerant microbial flora.},

  abstract = {Currently, one of the biggest challenges in microbial and ecosystem ecology is to develop conceptual models that organize the growing body of information on environmental microbiology into a clear mechanistic framework with a direct link to ecosystem processes. Doing so will enable development of testable hypotheses to better direct future research and increase understanding of key constraints on biogeochemical networks. Although the understanding of phenotypic and genotypic diversity of microorganisms in the environment is rapidly accumulating, how controls on microbial physiology ultimately affect biogeochemical fluxes remains poorly understood. We propose that insight into constraints on biogeochemical cycles can be achieved by a more rigorous evaluation of microbial community biomass composition within the context of ecological stoichiometry. Multiple recent studies have pointed to microbial biomass stoichiometry as an important determinant of when microorganisms retain or recycle mineral nutrients. We identify the relevant cellular components that most likely drive changes in microbial biomass stoichiometry by defining a conceptual model rooted in ecological stoichiometry. More importantly, we show how X-ray microanalysis (XRMA), nanoscale secondary ion mass spectroscopy (NanoSIMS), Raman microspectroscopy, and in situ hybridization techniques (for example, FISH) can be applied in concert to allow for direct empirical evaluation of the proposed conceptual framework. This approach links an important piece of the ecological literature, ecological stoichiometry, with the molecular front of the microbial revolution, in an attempt to provide new insight into how microbial physiology could constrain ecosystem processes.},

A gas-permeable membrane is used to remove CO2 or NH3 from acidic (SIGMACO2) or basic (NH4+) reagent streams into a receiving stream and conductivity detector. Linear negative responses occur over a wide range of concentrations ({$<$}0.1-20 mM SIGMACO2; 0.1-100 muM NH4+). Adding Zn2+ to sulfidic samples prevents H2S interferences for CO2 and allows determination of H2S at high concentration ({$>$}0.1 mM) by difference (with, without Zn).

  abstract = {Next-generation sequencing techniques, and PhyloChip, have made simultaneous phylogenetic analyses of hundreds of microbial communities possible. Insight into community structure has been limited by the inability to integrate and visualize such vast datasets. Fast UniFrac overcomes these issues, allowing integration of larger numbers of sequences and samples into a single analysis. Its new array-based implementation offers orders of magnitude improvements over the original version. New 3D visualization of principal coordinates analysis results, with the option to view multiple coordinate axes simultaneously, provides a powerful way to quickly identify patterns that relate vast numbers of microbial communities. We show the potential of Fast UniFrac using examples from three data types: Sanger-sequencing studies of diverse free-living and animal-associated bacterial assemblages and from the gut of obese humans as they diet, pyrosequencing data integrated from studies of the human hand and gut, and PhyloChip data from a study of citrus pathogens. We show that a Fast UniFrac analysis using a reference tree recaptures patterns that could not be detected without considering phylogenetic relationships and that Fast UniFrac, coupled with BLAST-based sequence assignment, can be used to quickly analyze pyrosequencing runs containing hundreds of thousands of sequences, showing patterns relating human and gut samples. Finally, we show that the application of Fast UniFrac to PhyloChip data could identify well-defined subcategories associated with infection. Together, these case studies point the way toward a broad range of applications and show some of the new features of Fast UniFrac.},

Water and sediment directly underlying water with origin in the Arctic, Pacific or Atlantic oceans were analyzed by pyrosequencing and length heterogeneity-PCR in conjunction with physicochemical and geographic distance data to determine what features structure ABS microbiomes. Distinct bacterial communities were evident in all water masses. Alphaproteobacteria explained similarity in Arctic surface water and Pacific derived water. Deltaproteobacteria were abundant in Atlantic origin water and drove similarity among samples. Most archaeal sequences in water were related to unclassified marine Euryarchaeota. Sediment communities influenced by Pacific and Atlantic water were distinct from each other and pelagic communities. Firmicutes and Chloroflexi were abundant in sediment, although their distribution varied in Atlantic and Pacific influenced sites. Thermoprotei dominated archaea in Pacific influenced sediments and Methanomicrobia dominated in methane-containing Atlantic influenced sediments. Length heterogeneity-PCR data from this study were analyzed with data from methane-containing sediments in other regions. Pacific influenced ABS sediments clustered with Pacific sites from New Zealand and Chilean coastal margins. Atlantic influenced ABS sediments formed another distinct cluster. Density and salinity were significant structuring features on pelagic communities. Porosity co-varied with benthic community structure across sites and methane did not. This study indicates that the origin of water overlying sediments shapes benthic communities locally and globally and that hydrography exerts greater influence on microbial community structure than the availability of methane.},

Bacterioplankton abundance (BA) averaged 13 × 106 cells ml−1 at all stations, a value that is higher than the average observed in many other temperate estuaries around the world, and were almost exclusively free-living. During the summer of 1998, BA often exceeded 30 × 106 cells ml−1 in the mesohaline region during periods of anoxia in subpycnocline waters. Dissolved MLOC typically accounted for 40\% of total MLOC and on some occasions during summer and autumn accounted for 80\%. A significant positive relationship between dissolved MLOC and BA was evident in the mesohaline Potomac River, the region where anoxia occurs each summer, but the regressions of particulate MLOC and chla on BA were not significant at this location. In the mesohaline Potomac River, BA regressed negatively and significantly on dissolved oxygen (r2=0.50, p{$<$}0.001). BA may be an important indicator of ecosystem health in this and other eutrophied estuaries, because of the relationships between BA, dissolved MLOC, and dissolved oxygen in the salinity stratified Potomac River and because free-living BA was elevated along the length of the river.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: We measured pelagic dinitrogen (N2) fixation by incorporation of 15N2 during regular cruises over 4 yr to deep hypoxic basins in the Southern California Bight, USA. N2 fixation in the photic zone was dominated (80\%) by nanoplankton ({$<$}10 µm). N2 fixation rates in surface waters were near the upper range measured for nanoplankton in tropical waters, averaging 5.8 µmol m–3 d–1 at the San Pedro Ocean Time Series (SPOTS) station, and 2.4 µmol m–3 d–1 at the Santa Monica Bay Observatory (SMBO) station, with a maximum at SPOTS of 35 µmol m–3 d–1. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays and nested PCR-based clone libraries targeting the nitrogenase gene nifH indicate that the uncultivated unicellular cyanobacterial group A (UCYN-A) is an abundant diazotroph in the photic zone. Although N2 fixation rates were highest at the surface, mean N2 fixation averaged 0.07 µmol m–3 d–1 at depths of 500 and 885 m within hypoxic basin waters ({$<$}10\% O2 saturation). When integrated over the aphotic water column, this deep N2 fixation may account for as much as one-third of the total areal N2 fixation, estimated at 150 µmol N m–2 d–1. These deep hypoxic N2 fixers were an assemblage of heterotrophic bacteria, including Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria and putative sulfate-reducing bacteria. Our results suggest that N2 fixation could play a role in other hypoxic, high-nitrate waters.},

The study region was an area of converging Arctic and Atlantic currents where several distinct water masses were overlain and intersecting. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE) profiles of assemblages revealed 42 distinct band types overall, with minimum richness ( 8 band types) in Arctic surface water and Atlantic deep water, and maximum richness ( 22 band types) in regions of water mass mixing. Sequencing of DGGE bands revealed that most sequences ( 78 of 98) matched uncultured clones from major taxonomic marine groups, including the Acantharea, Bacillariophyceae, Cercozoa, Chrysophyceae, Dinophyceae, Prasinophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae, and stramenopiles, as well as the novel marine stramenopiles ( MAST), alveolate groups I and II, and picobiliphytes. Multivariate statistical analysis of DGGE profiles revealed that picoeukaryote assemblage composition was positively correlated with geographic proximity, abiotic environmental conditions ( salinity, photosynthetically active radiation, and transmissivity), and biotic community structure ( total phototrophic biomass and size class). Picoeukaryote assemblage similarity was also strongly associated with water mass origin; assemblages in close spatial proximity ( horizontally or vertically) showed less similarity if located in different water masses, while spatially distant assemblages showed higher similarity if located within the same water mass. This study highlights that ocean hydrodynamics must be considered to fully explain the distribution and diversity of microbes in this fluid realm.},

Primary production is one of the ecosystem—functions where existing data already support such expectations. However, for a mechanistic understanding of these processes more experimental investigations are needed. In terrestrial primary producer communities a directed removal of species is one important tool in the experimental portfolio to study the consequences of a decline in biodiversity. However, this is notoriously difficult in suspended aquatic primary producer communities consisting of mostly unicellular phytoplankton. As phytoplankton are responsible for about 50\% of global primary production, detailed knowledge of whether and how diversity declines will impact the functioning of natural phytoplankton communities is of crucial importance. Here, we tested two different methods, dilution and disturbance—to manipulate diversity of natural freshwater plankton communities along an experimental gradient in a directed way. Dilution will alter community composition by affecting mainly rare species whereas disturbance will affect mainly stress sensitive species. Both methods resulted in distinct and replicable species richness gradients. Such gradients enable the mechanistic study of general responses to biodiversity loss in natural phytoplankton communities with shared evolutionary history in an ecological meaningful way.},

From September 2008 to December 2009, water samples (n~=~111) were collected from the Ruhr and Rhine rivers and from the influents and effluents of a wastewater plant (n~=~12). Quantitative real time (RT-) PCR was used to determine the abundance of PMMoV, hPBV, and TTV in comparison to human adenoviruses (HAdV) and human polyomaviruses (HPyV) that are frequently detected in surface water and were previously proposed as indicators. While PMMoV was detected in all river water samples, the other viruses were detected less frequently. The concentration of the studied viruses in positive river water ranged from 5~×~101 to 1.07~×~106 genome equivalents per liter (gen.equ./l). All wastewater samples were positive for PMMoV, HAdV and HPyV, while TTV and hPBV were detected in 6/12 and 3/12 of samples, respectively. To determine if PMMoV is specific to human-derived fecal waste, fecal samples from human (n~=~20) and animal (n~=~53) were also tested. In contrast to the ubiquity of PMMoV in human feces (19/20) the virus was only detected at low concentration in a minority of the animal fecal samples tested (7/15 from chicken, 1/10 from Geese and 1/6 from cows). Therefore, in this setting TTV and hPBV do not seem to be suitable indicators of fecal contamination in water. Whereas, the high excretion level and dissemination of PMMoV in human sewage and river water suggest that PMMoV could be a promising indicator of fecal pollution in surface water.},

  abstract = {The dynamics and formation mechanisms of marine snow aggregates from abandoned larvacean houses were examined by laboratory experiments and field sampling during a spring diatom bloom in a shallow fjord on the west coast of the USA. Intact aggregates were sampled both from sediment traps and directly from the water column by divers. All aggregates were composed of 1 abandoned house of the larvacean Oikopleura dioica to which numerous diatoms, fecal pellets, ciliates, and amorphous detritus were attached. High vertical flux rates (20000 to 120000 houses m-2 d-1) and settling velocities (average 120 m d-1) imply a rapid turnover of suspended larvacean houses, and concentrations of diatoms and fecal pellets in the aggregates exceeding ambient concentrations by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude suggest their potential importance in driving the vertical flux of particles. Identical particle assemblages were observed in aggregates collected in the water column and in sediment traps. Most of the fecal pellets found in the houses were most likely produced by the larvaceans themselves. Numbers of diatoms per house corresponded with the diatom concentrations in the ambient water and, on average, each aggregate contained diatoms in abundances corresponding to those found in 4.5 ml of ambient water. Laboratory measurements showed that larvacean houses scavenge diatoms and fecal pellets while sinking, and observed scavenging rates were similar to those predicted from theory. However, both predicted and observed scavenging rates in experiments were orders of magnitude too low to account for the particle content observed on aggregates from the water column. Based on models, shear coagulation was also assessed to be insignificant in forming aggregates. It is concluded that most of the particles become attached to the incurrent filters of the larvacean house while it is still inhabited, and that shear and sinking insignificantly contribute to particle collisions and adhesions on the abandoned house.},

The focus of the field is now shifting to identifying the mechanisms that shape these patterns.

We consider how the interplay of these processes affects one biogeographic pattern, the distance–decay relationship, and review evidence from the published literature for the processes driving this pattern in microorganisms. Given the limitations of inferring processes from biogeographic patterns, we suggest that studies should focus on directly testing the underlying processes.},

  abstract = {Many college students abandon their goal of completing a degree in STEM when confronted with challenging introductory-level science courses. In the U.S., this trend is more pronounced for underrepresented minority (URM) and first-generation (FG) students, and contributes to persisting racial and social-class achievement gaps in higher education. Previous intervention studies have focused exclusively on race or social class, but have not examined how the two may be confounded and interact. This research therefore investigates the independent and interactive effects of race and social class as moderators of an intervention designed to promote performance, measured by grade in the course. In a double-blind randomized experiment conducted over four semesters of an introductory biology course (N = 1040), we tested the effectiveness of a utility-value intervention in which students wrote about the personal relevance of course material. The utility-value intervention was successful in reducing the achievement gap for FG-URM students by 61\%: the performance gap for FG-URM students, relative to CG-Majority students, was large in the control condition, .84 grade points (d = .98), and the treatment effect for FG-URM students was .51 grade points (d = 0.55). The UV intervention helped students from all groups find utility value in the course content, and mediation analyses showed that the process of writing about utility value was particularly powerful for FG-URM students. Results highlight the importance of examining the independent and interactive effects of race and social class when evaluating interventions to close achievement gaps and the mechanisms through which they may operate.},

Interventions have been developed to close achievement gaps for underrepresented minority students and women, but no prior research has attempted to close the gap for first-generation students, a population that accounts for nearly a fifth of college students. We report a values affirmation intervention conducted with 798 U.S. students (154 first-generation) in an introductory biology course for majors. For first-generation students, values affirmation significantly improved final course grades and retention in the second course in the biology sequence, as well as overall GPA for the semester. This brief intervention narrowed the achievement gap between first-generation and continuing generation students for course grades by 50\% and increased retention in a critical gateway course by 20\%. Our results suggest that educators can expand the pipeline for first-generation students to continue studying in the biosciences with psychological interventions.},

  abstract = {Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) is a plant virus that has been recently proposed as a potential indicator of human fecal contamination of environmental waters; however, information on its geographical occurrence in surface water is still limited. We aimed to determine the seasonal and geographic occurrence of PMMoV in drinking water sources all over Japan. Between July 2008 and February 2011, 184 source water samples were collected from 30 drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs); viruses from 1 to 2 liters of each sample were concentrated by using an electronegative membrane, followed by RNA extraction and reverse transcription. Using quantitative PCR, PMMoV was detected in 140 (76\%) samples, with a concentration ranging from 2.03 × 103 to 2.90 × 106 copies/liter. At least one of the samples from 27 DWTPs (n = 4 or 8) was positive for PMMoV; samples from 10 of these DWTPs were always contaminated. There was a significant difference in the occurrence of PMMoV among geographical regions but not a seasonal difference. PMMoV was frequently detected in samples that were negative for human enteric virus or Escherichia coli. A phylogenetic analysis based on the partial nucleotide sequences of the PMMoV coat protein gene in 12 water samples from 9 DWTPs indicated that there are genetically diverse PMMoV strains present in drinking water sources in Japan. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the occurrence of PMMoV in environmental waters across wide geographical regions.},

Multiple imputation (MI) (Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys. Wiley: New York, 1987) is a simulation-based approach to deal with incomplete data. Although there are many different methods to deal with incomplete data, MI has become one of the leading methods. Since the late 1980s we observed a constant increase in the use and publication of MI-related research. This tutorial does not attempt to cover all the material concerning MI, but rather provides an overview and combines together the theory behind MI, the implementation of MI, and discusses increasing possibilities of the use of MI using commercial and free software. We illustrate some of the major points using an example from an Alzheimer disease (AD) study. In this AD study, while clinical data are available for all subjects, postmortem data are only available for the subset of those who died and underwent an autopsy. Analysis of incomplete data requires making unverifiable assumptions. These assumptions are discussed in detail in the text. Relevant S-Plus code is provided.

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

This review summarizes our understanding of the plankton ecosystem for this station and examines interannual variability for the primary producers. The weathership era characterized a period of high temporal sampling resolution with a limited number of parameters being measured. In contrast, the post-weathership period focussed on seasonal sampling (usually three times per year), but a wider range of parameters were measured and sediment traps were deployed to estimate carbon and opal flux rates. The mixed layer depth is shallow compared to the Atlantic Ocean, ranging from 40 to 120 m in late summer and winter respectively. Nitrate, silicate and phosphate are saturating year round with only a few exceptions in the 1970s. Winter and summer Si: N ratios are the same (1.5:1). Ammonium and urea are 0.5 uM in winter and near detection limits (similar to0.1 uM) in late summer. Iron is limiting (similar to0.05 nM) in late spring and summer for the growth of large diatoms, but iron is co-limiting with irradiance in winter. Chlorophyll and primary productivity are low and show little seasonal variation (about 2 times). Summer chl is about 20 mg m(-2) while primary productivity ranges from 400-850 mg C m(-2)d(-1). The f-ratio of 0.25 does not vary with seasons and indicates that primary productivity is fueled by regenerated nitrogen (e.g. NH4 and urea). Small cells ({$<$}5 um) are normally abundant and they utilize regenerated nitrogen produced by the micrograzers; they do not appear to be Fe-limited, but rather controlled by the micrograzers. Shipboard carboy experiments indicate that large diatoms become dominant when iron is added. Therefore top down control is exerted by the micrograzers on the small cells, while there is bottom up control of the large phytoplankton due to low Fe concentrations.},

Few studies connect OSDS to coastal water quality. Most studies examined pathogen and nutrient impacts to groundwater and omitted estimations of contaminants discharged to surface water. The majority of studies focused on nitrogen, with little information on pathogens and even less on phosphorus. Nitrogen discharged from OSDS poses the greatest threat to water quality. Vertical distance of septic tank infiltration system from the water table, septic system design, and siting remain the key components in minimizing potential impacts from OSDS for control of both pathogens and nutrients. The most comprehensive information connecting nutrient contributions from OSDS to surface water quality was the study conducted on Buttermilk Bay in Massachusetts where 74\% of nitrogen to the bay was attributed to onsite disposal systems. In conclusion, further studies on the viability and transport of pathogens and nutrients through the groundwater aquifer and across the groundwater/surface-water interface are needed. Additional research on the importance of septic system design on the availability of contaminants to groundwater as well as the minimum distance between the septic system and water table necessary to protect groundwater are also indicated.},

  abstract = {With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic. We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US\$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.},

  abstract = {Rates of organic carbon input, oxidation and burial in marine sediments were studied with the goal of assessing the role of an oxygen deficient water column in the preservation of organic matter. Factors influencing these rates were investigated in two locations: the Washington state and NW Mexican continental margins. The Mexican continental margin is in contact with the oxygen deficient zone of the eastern tropical North Pacific. Carbon budgets for the Washington and Mexican margins indicated a larger percentage of the surface export flux reached the sediments and a greater fraction of the material arrived at the seafloor escaped degradation to be buried permanently. The attenuation in the carbon oxidation rate with water column depth for the Mexican margin was less than is typical of other margin regions. Empirical attenuation coefficients derived from a power function relation were 0.931 and 0.439 for the Washington and Mexican margins, respectively. Multi-G type models suggested that organic matter degraded in Mexican sediments was less reactive than that in Washington sediments. Sediment slurry and whole-core incubations were conducted to assess the effects of mixing and oxygen exposure on the rate and extent of carbon degradation. Sediments from the Mexican oxygen-deficient zone were less susceptible to degradation than sediments from the oxic Mexican shelf and the Washington margin under all incubation conditions, suggesting that the organic matter in the oxygen-deficient zone may be intrinsically less reactive. The isotopic fractionation of oxygen and nitrogen during respiration was measured on both margins. The apparent respiration fractionation factor, A, for oxygen under conditions of carbon-limited degradation was 0.992. It was hypothesized that long oxygen exposure times, respiration under isotopically fractionating conditions and organic carbon:mineral surface-area ratios less than 1.0 are each related to the extent of degradation and imply low carbon burial efficiencies. High carbon burial efficiencies (and low carbon oxidation efficiencies) were found in oxygen-deficient zone sediments which had short oxygen exposure times, little or no fractionation of oxygen and nitrogen and carbon: surface-area ratios {$>$}3.0.},

PP buried in the study sites with salinity values ≤3 was similar in concentration and form to PP entering the Patuxent from the watershed, suggesting efficient sequestration by the sediments at these low-salinity sites. PP extracted with citrate–dithionite–bicarbonate was the dominant form of PP at all salinities and all depths, and organic-P was the second most abundant fraction. We estimated that 81\% of PP entering from the watershed is trapped in the sediments of the upper Patuxent subestuary and that the subtidal sediments retain three times as much PP as the marshes adjacent to the study sites.},

To address this, we tested whether the mechanisms that underlie bacterial temporal β-diversity vary across different scales in three marine microbial communities. While seasonal turnover was detected, at least 73\% of the community variation occurred at intra-seasonal temporal scales, suggesting that episodic events are important in structuring marine microbial communities. In addition, turnover at different temporal scales appeared to be driven by different factors. Intra-seasonal turnover was significantly correlated to environmental variables such as phosphate and silicate concentrations, while seasonal and interannual turnover were related to nitrate concentration and temporal distance. We observed a strong link between the magnitude of environmental variation and bacterial β-diversity in different communities. Analogous to spatial biogeography, we found different rates of community changes across temporal scales.},

  abstract = {Diel vertical migration (DVM) by zooplankton is a universal feature in all the World’s oceans, as well as being common in freshwater environments. The normal pattern involves movement from shallow depths at night to greater depths during the day. For many herbivorous and omnivorous mesozooplankton that feed predominantly near the surface on phytoplankton and microzooplankton, minimising the risk of predation from fish seems to be the ultimate factor behind DVM. These migrants appear to use deep water as a dark daytime refuge where their probability of being detected and eaten is lower than if they remained near the surface. Associated with these vertical movements of mesozooplankton, predators at higher trophic levels, including invertebrates, fish, marine mammals, birds and reptiles, may modify their behaviour to optimise the exploitation of their vertically migrating prey. Recent advances in biotelemetry promise to allow the interaction between migrating zooplankton and diving air-breathing vertebrates to be explored in far more detail than hitherto.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic nutrient discharge poses widespread threats to coastal ecosystems and has increased environmental gradients from coast to sea. Bacterioplankton play crucial roles in coastal biogeochemical cycling, and a variety of factors affect bacterial community diversity and structure. We used 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to investigate the spatial variation in bacterial community composition (BCC) across five sites on a coast-offshore gradient in the East China Sea. Overall, bacterial alpha-diversity did not differ across sites, except that richness and phylogenetic diversity were lower in the offshore sites, and the highest alpha-diversity was found in the most landward site, with Chl-a being the main factor. BCCs generally clustered into coastal and offshore groups. Chl-a explained 12.3\% of the variation in BCCs, more than that explained by either the physicochemical (5.7\%) or spatial (8.5\%) variables. Nutrients (particularly nitrate and phosphate), along with phytoplankton abundance, were more important than other physicochemical factors, co-explaining 20.0\% of the variation in BCCs. Additionally, a series of discriminant families (primarily affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria), whose relative abundances correlated with Chl-a, DIN, and phosphate concentrations, were identified, implying their potential to indicate phytoplankton blooms and nutrient enrichment in this marine ecosystem. This study provides insight into bacterioplankton response patterns along a coast-offshore gradient, with phytoplankton abundance increasing in the offshore sites. Time-series sampling across multiple transects should be performed to determine the seasonal and spatial patterns in bacterial diversity and community structure along this gradient.},

  abstract = {In the marine environment, transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) are ubiquitous and abundant, playing a significant role in carbon cycling and the structuring of food webs. Previous studies have shown that phytoplankton, bacteria, and oysters contribute to the production of TEP through the release of exopolymers. However, little is known about other potential sources of TEP and TEP precursors, especially in coastal systems. It was hypothesized that suspension feeders contribute to the TEP pool in near-shore environments through the release of exopolymers in both the dissolved and particulate form, and tested these hypotheses in both laboratory and field experiments. In the laboratory, the production of TEP by several species of benthic suspension feeders (the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis; the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians; the slipper snail, Crepidula fornicata; and the solitary ascidians, Ciona intestinalis and Styela clava) was investigated from October to November 2002 and June 2003. Concentrations of TEP and DOC were determined by spectrophotometry after alcian blue staining and high-temperature, catalytic oxidation, respectively. Similar analyses were conducted on water samples from the field in July 2003, collected in close proximity to dense beds of mussels in the Poquonnock River, Connecticut, USA (41°19′ N, −72°02′ W). Laboratory results indicated that actively-pumping blue mussels, bay scallops, slipper snails, and both species of solitary ascidians significantly enhanced TEP concentrations above background levels over a five-hour period. However, only the solitary tunicate S. clava significantly enhanced DOC concentrations above background levels over the same period of time. Field samples indicated that TEP and DOC concentrations were high in close proximity to dense beds of mussels. These results imply that a variety of benthic suspension feeders produce TEP during feeding activities which could lead to enhanced flocculation of organic matter and carbon deposition in near-shore waters.},

  abstract = {The aim was to estimate the impacts of invasive Impatiens parviflora on forests’ herbal layer communities. A replicated Before-After-Control-Impact field experiment and comparisons with adjacent uninvaded plots were used. The alien’s impact on species richness was tested using hierarchical generalized mixed effect models with Poisson error structure. Impact on species composition was tested using multivariate models (DCA, CCA, RDA) and Monte-Carlo permutation tests. Removal plots did not differ in native species richness from neither invaded nor adjacent uninvaded plots, both when the treatment’s main effect or its interaction with sampling time was tested (Chi2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.4757, DF{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.7883; Chi2{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}7.229, DF{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}8, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.5121 respectively). On the contrary, ordination models revealed differences in the development of plots following the treatments (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.034) with the invaded plots differing from the adjacent uninvaded (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.002). Impatiens parviflora is highly unlikely to impact native species richness of invaded communities, which may be associated with its limited ability to create a dense canopy, a modest root system or the fact the I. parviflora does not represent a novel and distinctive dominant to the invaded communities. Concerning its potential impacts on species composition, the presence of native clonal species (Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris filix-mas, Fragaria moschata, Luzula luzuloides, Poa nemoralis) on the adjacent uninvaded plots likely makes them different from the invaded plots. However, these competitive and strong species are more likely to prevent the invasion of I. parviflora on the adjacent uninvaded plots rather than being themselves eliminated from the invaded communities.},

  abstract = {Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in stools and sewage has recently been reported, raising the hypothesis of faecal-oral transmission. If confirmed, this could have far-reaching consequences for public health and for pandemic control strategies. In this paper, we argue that a comprehensive and more nuanced analysis is required to test this hypothesis, taking into consideration both environmental dynamics and the persistence of viral infectivity. First, we examine the evidence regarding the presence of the virus in stools and sewage. Then we discuss the current framework of disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a respiratory disease fits into it. Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person. This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions. Finally, the paper briefly discusses practical implications, based on current knowledge, for containment of the pandemic.},

We quantify the role of neutral processes by simulating division, mutation, and death of 100,000 individual marine bacteria cells with full 1 million–base-pair genomes in a global surface ocean circulation model. The model is run for up to 100,000 years and output is analyzed using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) alignment and metagenomics fragment recruitment. Simulations show the production and maintenance of biogeographic patterns, characterized by distinct provinces subject to mixing and periodic takeovers by neighbors (coalescence), after which neutral evolution reestablishes the province and the patterns reorganize. The emergent patterns are substantial (e.g., down to 99.5\% DNA identity between North and Central Pacific provinces) and suggest that microbes evolve faster than ocean currents can disperse them. This approach can also be used to explore environmental selection. Patterns of life in the ocean wave The open ocean is not uniform. The seas teem with unseen life that has evolved distinctive patterns of species distribution, much as the land-bound world contains a spectrum of biological provinces. Taking data from genome studies, Hellweger et al. devised a model showing how marine bacteria diversified throughout the world's oceans into stable geographic provinces independently of natural selection (see the Perspective by Giovannoni and Nemergut). All that is needed to create these distributions are mutations and ocean currents. Science, this issue p. 1346; see also p. 1246},

The microbial breakdown of this material in the subsurface ocean generates carbon dioxide. Collectively, this microbially mediated flux of carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean interior is termed the biological pump. In recent decades it has become clear that the composition of the phytoplankton community in the surface ocean largely determines the quantity and quality of organic matter that sinks to depth. This settling organic matter, however, is not sufficient to meet the energy demands of microbes in the dark ocean. Two additional sources of organic matter have been identified: non-sinking organic particles of debated origin that escape capture by sediment traps and exhibit stable concentrations throughout the dark ocean, and microbes that convert inorganic carbon into organic matter. Whether these two sources can together account for the significant mismatch between organic matter consumption and supply in the dark ocean remains to be seen. It is clear, however, that the microbial community of the deep ocean works in a fundamentally different way from surface water communities. View full text},

Most predictive models use only environmental parameters, although a long history of ecological literature suggests that community complexity should also be an informative parameter. Thus, we hypothesize that incorporating information about a community’s complexity might improve predictive power in microbial models. Here, we present a new metric, called community ‘cohesion,’ that quantifies the degree of connectivity of a microbial community. We analyze six long-term (10+ years) microbial data sets using the cohesion metrics and validate our approach using data sets where absolute abundances of taxa are available. As a case study of our metrics’ utility, we show that community cohesion is a strong predictor of Bray–Curtis dissimilarity (R2=0.47) between phytoplankton communities in Lake Mendota, WI, USA. Our cohesion metrics outperform a model built using all available environmental data collected during a long-term sampling program. The result that cohesion corresponds strongly to Bray–Curtis dissimilarity is consistent across the six long-term time series, including five phytoplankton data sets and one bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set. We explain here the calculation of our cohesion metrics and their potential uses in microbial ecology.},

In microbial communities, cross-feeding is a widespread type of biotic interaction that has the potential to affect community assembly and stability. Yet, there is little understanding of how the presence of cross-feeding within a community affects invasion risk. Here, I develop a metabolite-explicit model where native microbial taxa interact through both cross-feeding and competition for metabolites. I use this model to study how the strength of biotic interactions, especially cross-feeding, influence whether an introduced taxon can join the community. I found that stronger cross-feeding and competition led to much lower invasion risk, as both types of biotic interactions lead to greater metabolite scarcity for the invader. I also evaluated the impact of a successful invader on community composition and structure. The effect of invaders on the native community was greatest at intermediate levels of cross-feeding; at this ‘critical’ level of cross-feeding, successful invaders generally cause decreased diversity, decreased productivity, greater metabolite availability, and decreased quantities of metabolites exchanged among taxa. Furthermore, these changes resulting from a successful primary invader made communities further susceptible to future invaders. The increase in invasion risk was greatest when the network of metabolite exchange between taxa was minimally redundant. Thus, this model demonstrates a case of invasional meltdown that is mediated by initial invaders disrupting the metabolite exchange networks of the native community.},

We hypothesized that keystone taxa, which influence community assembly through strong biotic interactions, are important for regulating microbial community composition. While highly connected microbes have been identified, evidence that these taxa act as keystones is lacking, because keystone status requires influence on whole-community dynamics. We address this gap, showing that small subsets of highly connected keystone taxa (generally 1-5\% of richness) can be optimal predictors of whole-community compositional change. In three long-term datasets, greater connectivity due to the presence of keystone taxa corresponded to lower compositional turnover. We further hypothesized that the influence of keystone taxa would be diminished when environmental disturbance was a strong driver of compositional change. We used two case studies of reference and disturbed communities to investigate how biotic and abiotic forces interact to shape community composition. Most of the same taxa were present in both the reference and disturbed communities, but keystone taxa had much greater explanatory power in the reference communities. Our results suggest that greater biotic connectivity arising from the presence of keystone taxa is stabilizing to community composition, and that keystone taxa can be good indicators of pending community shifts.

  abstract = {Knowledge of metabolic rates of euphausiid diel vertical migrants in the ocean is of paramount importance to understand the role of these organisms in the downward transport of carbon due to their feeding in the epipelagic zone and subsequent respiration, egestion, excretion and mortality in the mesopelagic zone. Enzymatic activities are used as proxies for the estimation of metabolism in deep waters because of the logistical problems related to measure these rates at depth. However, metabolic activities of euphausiids in the so-called oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are still not well understood. The OMZs are expanding as the effect of the global warming. Knowledge about the metabolic response of organisms transiting these zones will help to understand the fate of zooplanktonic communities and vertical active flux. The electron transport system (ETS) and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS) activities were used as proxies for potential respiration and growth in planktonic organisms. Here, we measured these enzymatic activities in Euphausia distinguenda in the well-oxygenated epipelagic layer and in the OMZ of the northern boundary of the Eastern Tropical Pacific off Mexico. E. distinguenda was found in the mixed layer at night (\textasciitilde 3.5 mL O2 L−1) and near the core of the OMZ (0.2 mL O2 L−1) during daytime between 200 and 350 m depth. We found higher ETS and AARS specific activities in the warm mixed layer at night and significantly lower in the colder OMZ during daytime because of temperature differences. However, when the effect of temperature was subtracted in both enzyme activities, higher values in the mesopelagic layer were observed. This result is tentatively explained by the increase in substrates as the effect of feeding at night in the upper layers and their oxygen consumption at depth during day in order to compensate for the colder temperature and low dissolved oxygen concentration. This physiological mechanism allows E. distinguenda diel vertical migrants to partly face the physical constraints of vertical migration imposed to avoid predators.},

  abstract = {Little is known of the factors shaping sediment bacterial communities, despite their high abundance and reports of high diversity. Two factors hypothesized to shape bacterial communities in the water column are nutrient (resource) availability and virus infection. The role these factors play in benthic bacterial diversity was assessed in oligotrophic carbonate–based sediments of Florida Bay (USA). Sediment–water mesocosm enclosures were made from 1-m diameter clear polycarbonate cylinders which were pushed into sediments to ˜201 cm sediment depth enclosing ˜80 L of water. Mesocosms were amended each day for 14 d with 10 µM NH 4 + and 1 µM PO 4 3− . In a second experiment, viruses from a benthic flocculent layer were concentrated and added back to flocculent layer samples which were collected near the mesocosm enclosures. Photosynthesis by microalgae in virus-amended incubations was monitored by pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorescence. In both experiments, bacterial diversity was estimated using automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), a high-resolution fingerprinting approach. Initial sediment bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness (236 ± 3) was higher than in the water column (148 ± 9), where an OTU was detectable when its amplified DNA represented {$>$}0.09\% of the total amplified DNA. Effects on bacterial diversity and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness in nutrient-amended mesocosms may have been masked by the effects of containment, which stimulated OTU richness in the water column, but depressed OTU richness and diversity in sediments. Nutrient addition significantly elevated virus abundance and the ratio of viruses to bacteria (p {$<$} 0.05 for both) in the sediments, concomitant with elevated bacterial diversity. However, water column bacterial diversity (in unamended controls) was not affected by nutrient amendments, which may be due to rapid nutrient uptake by sediment organisms or adsorption of P to carbonate sediments. Addition of live viruses to benthic flocculent layer samples increased bacterial OTU diversity and richness compared with heat-killed controls; however, cluster analyses showed that the community structure in the virus-amended mesocosms varied greatly between replicates. Despite the strong effects upon eubacterial communities, photosynthesis of co-occurring protists and cyanobacteria was not significantly altered by the presence of virus concentrates. This study supports the hypothesis that nutrient availability plays a key role in shaping sediment bacterial communities, and also that viruses may regulate the abundance of the dominant competitors and allow less dominant organisms to maintain or increase their abundance in a community due to decreased competition for resources.},

  abstract = {Viruses are hypothesized to maintain diversity in microbial assemblages by regulating the abundance of dominant competitors and thereby allowing less-dominant competitors to persist in assemblages; however, there have been few empirical data sets to support this idea. In this study, we examined the relationship between the ratio of viral abundance to bacterial abundance, viral production, and the relative richness and diversity of bacterial assemblage fingerprints, in samples taken from geographically widespread locations (North Pacific gyre, the Amazon River plume and adjacent North Atlantic gyre, Gulf of Mexico, Southern California Bight and Arafura—Coral Seas) which are oligo- to mesotrophic. Bacterial assemblage richness and diversity as measured by automated rRNA intergenic spacer (ARISA) fingerprinting were significantly and positively correlated with the ratio of virus abundance to bacteria abundance (VBR) and to the rate of virus production only in the oligotrophic North Pacific gyre. ARISA fingerprint richness/diversity were not significantly correlated to viral parameters when assessed across all samples in surface waters, suggesting there is not a singular global quantitative relationship between viral pressure and host diversity within well evolved host/virus systems in different geographic locations in plankton. In sediments off Southern California, viral parameters significantly and negatively correlated with ARISA diversity, suggesting strong viral interactions in this habitat. To examine covariation of viral parameters and the relative abundance and diversity of rarer bacterial taxa (i.e., less-dominant competitor), the richness and diversity of diazotroph communities was measured using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) of a portion (nifH) of the nitrogenase gene. The richness and diversity of diazotrophic communities were significantly and negatively correlated with viral parameters across all locations. Since diazotrophs include many opportunistic taxa (e.g. Vibrionaceae), and because these bacteria may be more susceptible to viral attack due to enhanced resource uptake abilities and potentially rapid localized growth, it is possible that this negative effect was due to enhanced viral lysis. Consequently, virus infection may have positive effects upon bacterioplankton diversity in the oligotrophic ocean, by regulating the abundance of dominant competitors, and allowing rarer taxa to coexist; however, some rarer taxa (such as diazotrophs) may be more susceptible to viral attack due to opportunistic lifestyles. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The planktonic cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. is a globally important diazotroph, fixing at least 80 Tg N yr(-1) in tropical waters. Despite its biogeochemical importance, the mechanisms of Trichodesmium mortality, and the means by which its fixed N enters upper levels of the food web, are poorly understood. Potential virus-like particle (VLP) production by Trichodesmium spp. was observed in both culture (IMS101) and field samples from the tropical North Pacific Ocean, in oceanic waters around the Hawaiian Islands. VLP observed by TEM in IMS101 lysate were approximately 56 nm wide and untailed, and VLP with similar morphology were observed in tissue treated with mitomycin C. A most-probable number cultivation technique (utilizing bacterized cultures of Trichodesmium) detected moderate abundances of Trichodesmium-infecting cyanophage (605 to 9750 ml(-1) infecting only 1 cultured strain) in 0.2 mum-filtered seawater samples from surface, subsurface and deep chlorophyll maximum samples. Estimation of mortality from virus production was not possible due to rapid VLP release in the first 6 h of dilution incubations. Rather, an indirect approach using burst size (determined from mitomycin C treatment of washed trichomes resuspended in virus-free seawater), decay rate of VLP (from latter part of virus production incubations) and average cyanophage titer was used to estimate mortality. These conservative calculations suggested that 0.3 to 6.5 \% d(-1) (mean = 1.65 +/- 0.99 \% d(-1)) of trichomes could potentially be lysed by viruses, representing the release of approximately 3 to 64 \% fixed N d(-1). These estimates are based upon a steady-state maintenance of observed VLP abundance, which in nature could be from lysogeny, pseudolysogeny, carrier state, or successive lytic infection. Viral lysis therefore may represent a significant novel mechanism of N release from Trichodesmium spp., even in non-bloom conditions.},

However, their impacts upon bacterioplankton assemblages have not been previously described. We investigated bacterioplankton assemblage composition using a sensitive DNA fingerprinting technique-automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARlSA)-over vertical profiles from surface waters to 1200 m depth. Bacterioplankton fingerprint richness and diversity were lowest immediately below the plume at 40 m, but at all other depths were statistically indistinguishable. Surface water bacterial production was significantly and negatively correlated with salinity (r = -0.805, p {$<$} 0.001, n = 22), and fingerprint Simpson's Reciprocal Index (diversity) and the total number of operational taxonomic units (OTU) per fingerprint (richness) were significantly correlated to bacterioplankton production (r = 0.52 and 0.74, respectively, p {$<$} 0.05, n = 22), but not to other measured environmental parameters. In both plume and non-plume oceanic waters, assemblages were dissimilar at surface and 40 m, suggesting different selection for taxa occurs vertically at these depths, irrespective of productivity and irradiance. Furthermore, there was no clear relationship between surface water assemblages located within plume waters and those experiencing more oceanic conditions, despite apparently distinct occurrence of certain common ({$>$} 1\% of fingerprint total amplified DNA fluorescence) OTUs in plume, intermediate plume and oceanic conditions. The inconsistency of total assemblage composition within surface plume waters demonstrates that assemblage composition is not tied directly to salinity but possibly to rapid microbial cycling and mixing of assemblages within small water masses. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the Amazon and Orinoco River offshore plumes have significant effects upon surface and underlying water bacterioplankton production in adjacent tropical waters.},

  abstract = {The benthic amphipod Diporeia is an ecologically and biogeochemically important constituent of deep freshwater lakes in North America. The proliferation of dreissenid mussels in the mid-1990s coincided with a sharp decrease in Diporeia populations in several Laurentian Great Lakes; however the ultimate cause and mechanisms of their decline are still unknown. Here we examined the composition of DNA viruses associated with Diporeia collected from populations of Lake Michigan that had declined and stable populations in Lake Superior and Owasco Lake (Finger Lake in central New York State). Viral metagenomic libraries from Owasco Lake and Lake Superior were comprised primarily of bacteriophages, which may infect bacteria within the amphipod microbiome. In contrast, the metagenomic library from Lake Michigan contained well-represented ssDNA circular viral genomes. The prevalence and viral load of one putative Type V ssDNA circular virus (LM29173) that recruited almost 30\% of total viral sequence reads in the Lake Michigan library was analyzed by quantitative PCR. The prevalence of LM29173 was over two orders of magnitude greater in Lake Michigan compared to the other two lakes. Although further research is necessary to establish the pathology and epidemiological extent of viral-Diporeia interactions, our data suggest that viruses may be numerically significant constituents of the Diporeia microbiome, and if pathogenic some of these viruses may be a stressor of Great Lakes Diporeia populations. Our data further indicate that special attention should be given to the circovirus that was prevalent in the declining Michigan population but uncommon in the other two lakes.},

We identified several highly represented, putative eukaryotic, circular, single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viral genomes. Among these, we discovered a genotype similar in both sequence and genomic architecture to a virus previously reported from a hyperthermal lake that shares characteristics of both single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) and single-stranded DNA viruses. We used quantitative polymerase chain reactions to study the prevalence and viral load of both positive-sense and negative-sense strands of the Daphnia mendotae-associated (Cladocera) hybrid virus (DMClaHV) over a summer season in Oneida and Cayuga lakes. DMClaHV had high prevalence within Daphnia populations, where viral load and the proportion of virus-positive individuals were higher preceding host population decline. DMClaHV viral load was different between two species of Daphnia (D. mendotae and D. retrocurva), and the dynamics between viruses and their hosts varied between the two lakes. We detected DMClaHV in eggs (ephippia) retrieved from Oneida Lake sediments with an estimated age of 30 yr. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed small (20 nm diameter) virus-like particles in Daphnia that were well away from gut tissues and not associated with intracellular parasites. Because Daphnia plays a critical role in many lake ecosystems, DMClaHV may have important effects on herbivory and thus carbon flow through the lake ecosystem.},

Temperature and salinity were used to identify distinct water masses within gyres. ARISA fingerprints each contained 15-117 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) per assemblage; however, the OTU composition of fingerprints varied among stations, even within the same water mass. Fingerprints from 500 in at the SPOTS station over 4 yr shared on average a Sorensen Index (presence/absence similarity) of 0.68 +/- 0.01 and a Whittaker Index (proportional representation similarity) of 0.68 0.01, whereas at more oceanic stations at 500 in, fingerprints shared a Sorensen Index of 0.48 +/- 0.01 and a Whittaker Index of 0.38 +/- 0.01. At deeper depths (1,000 and 2,000 in), fingerprints were equally variable, sharing Sorensen Indices of 0.42 +/- 0.02 and 0.50 +/- 0.02 and Whittaker indices of 0.33 +/- 0.001 and 0.34 +/- 0.03, at 1,000 m and 3,000 m, respectively. Mesopelagic, moderately productive waters were more stable than those at less productive, open-ocean gyre stations, suggesting that variability in bacterioplankton communities at depth is influenced by organic matter supply and patchiness.},

  abstract = {Bacterioplankton community diversity was investigated in the subtropical Brisbane River-Moreton Bay estuary, Australia (27°25′S, 153°5′E). Bacterial communities were studied using automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), which amplifies 16S-23S ribosomal DNA internally transcribed spacer regions from mixed-community DNA and detects the separated products on a fragment analyzer. Samples were collected from eight sites throughout the estuary and east to the East Australian Current (Coral Sea). Bacterioplankton communities had the highest operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness, as measured by ARISA at eastern bay stations (S [total richness] = 84 to 85 OTU) and the lowest richness in the Coral Sea (S = 39 to 59 OTU). Richness correlated positively with bacterial abundance; however, there were no strong correlations between diversity and salinity, NO3− and PO43− concentrations, or chlorophyll a concentration. Bacterioplankton communities at the riverine stations were different from communities in the bay or Coral Sea. The main differences in OTU richness between stations were in taxa that each represented 0.1\% (the detection limit) to 0.5\% of the total amplified DNA, i.e., the “tail” of the distribution. We found that some bacterioplankton taxa are specific to distinct environments while others have a ubiquitous distribution from river to sea. Bacterioplankton richness and diversity patterns in the estuary are potentially a consequence of greater niche availability, mixing of local and adjacent environment communities, or intermediate disturbance. Furthermore, these results contrast with previous reports of spatially homogeneous bacterioplankton communities in other coastal waters.},

Temporal changes in bacterioplankton assemblage composition were investigated during 7 drifter studies of 24 to 360 h duration in the oligotrophic Gulf of Mexico, the North Pacific and the West Tropical Atlantic in 2001 to 2003, using an assemblage fingerprinting technique, automated rRNA intergenic-spacer analysis (ARISA). The similarity indices between assemblages collected over time in the same drifter changed on average by a Sorensen index of 0.12 d(-1) (comparing the presence/absence of operational taxonomic units, OTU) and a Whittaker index (comparing proportions in various OTU) of 0.17 d-1 per fingerprint, across all surface drifter studies. Fingerprints generated from 7 replicate bacterioplankton DNA samples collected at each of 2 stations were remarkably similar to each other, sharing a Whittaker index {$>$} 0.85. Despite this consistency over small spatial scales ({$<$} 2 km), no clear relationship was observed between the separation distance of sampling locations and similarity between assemblage fingerprints in the North Pacific and Atlantic gyres over mesoscales (10 to 3000 km), oscillating around a mean of 0.38 to 0.47 for each gyre. Our results suggest that factors ultimately shaping assemblage composition are localized at spatial scales between a few kilometers and about 50 km, i.e. this is a typical horizontal `patch size', within which communities are relatively homogenous, perhaps because physical mixing (e.g. by eddies) may dominate over biological interactions. Our results also suggest that, while similar environmental factors may cause bacterioplankton assemblages to share a small portion of OTU between different sampling locations, biological factors selecting for particular bacterial types (e.g. viral lysis, grazing, antagonism, nutrition) may cause assemblage composition variability over short geographic distances.},

However, there was no consistent response of viral enrichment on total bacterial and diazotroph assemblages at stations with similar environmental conditions, Suggesting that untested variables, small spatial scale factors, or stochastic processes influence the outcome of viral activities. Across all experiments, the relative abundance of the more common operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in fingerprints were not significantly impacted compared to the abundance of rare OTUs.

Reverse migrations are also found to be a common occurrence in the region studied. Usually, a surface layer begins to descend at dusk as soon as the upward migrating layer arrives in surface waters. Vertical velocity measured from the ADCP provides the first detailed direct measurements of the swimming speeds of the populations in situ, which are generally between 2 and 6 cm s\textasciitilde '.

The most significant contributions of the research based on this data set are: (1) demonstration of the alteration of a low mode coastal-trapped wave by a sharp bend in topography; (2) demonstration that fluctuating currents on a semi-enclosed shelf can be driven by the flow along its open boundary; (3) demonstration that topographic waves exist in the completely enclosed portion of coastal basins. In addition, the research allowed an order of magnitude improvements in regional knowledge of both the seasonal and subtidal scale fluctuations within the Southern California Bight. For example, on seasonal scales, the winter surfacing of the California undercurrent (the dominant feature of the seasonal mean flow field) as well as the continuity of the undercurrent in a spatially limited region were addressed. The existence of an equatorward undercurrent at mid water column depths (300–500m) over the continental slope during the late summer to fall season was also documented. On subtidal scales, the data demonstrated that the velocity field is far from “quiescent” over the basin, even below the depth of the deepest basin sill. Spatially-organized subtidal fluctuations occur at all depths and the time scale of the dominant fluctuations (∼ 20–30d) is a factor of two or more longer than that typical of most coastal shelves. The fluctuations have a subsarface maximum during most of the year and the maximum is best developed in late summer and over the mainland slope of the basin. Propagation characteristics south of the basin and within the basin along its coastal perimeter are consistent with those of first mode freely propagating coastal-trapped waves at these long periods. The long period waves enter the basin from southeast and then appear to pivot conterclockwise around the basin, so that at least some porion of the waves exits the basin over its western sill. The phase speed of the waves is reduced by an order of magnitude over all but the coastal slope of the basin. Below sill-depth velocity and temperature fluctuations appear to be the signature of freely propagating basin-scale topographic waves driven by the long period upper water column fluctuations. The waves travel counterclockwise around the lower basin at speeds about 25cm s−1. Current fluctuations over the adjacent inner Santa Monica shelf have significant variance at shorter periods as well as at the longer periods observed over the basin and its slopes. These fluctuations are driven predominantly by boundary forcing over the outer shelf and only secondary by local wind stress. Wind data suggests that although local upwelling within the Bight is extremely limited from late spring through fall, strong upwelling events occur routinely in winter early spring. During the summer to fall months effects of upwelling may be experienced within the Bight, but these effects are primarily the results of upwelling outside the Bight in combination with lateral advection. During periods of strong upwelling outside the Bigth, outflow from Santa Monica basin appears to be preferentially directed south of the Channel Islands rather than through the Santa Barbara Channel.},

  abstract = {Time series of midbasin hydrographic samples and of an array of moored temperature-velocity sensors are used to examine subtidal to interannual scale variability in two ∼900-m-deep basins off the southern California coast. The deepest sill that allows entry into the basins is at 740 m, and the two basins, Santa Monica and San Pedro, are separated by a sill about 40 m high. The mean flow 40 m above and 60 m below the 740-m sill depth is in the counterclockwise direction and the magnitude is ∼0.5–1.0 cm s−1. The data indicate that the waters at deeper levels of the basins are neither quiescent, at one extreme, nor are they filled with random noise, at the other extreme. Rather, at all scales examined, the variability is significant and much of it is spatially coherent. The amplitude of the subtidal velocity fluctuations is ∼4 cm s−1, almost an order of magnitude greater than that of the mean flow. The amplitude of the subtidal temperature fluctuations is ∼0.1°C at 700 m and ∼0.05°C at 800 m. The temperature variance is roughly a factor of 2 smaller at midbasin than on the basin perimeter. This is not the case with the velocity variance, which is generally greatest at midbasin and on the coastal edges of both basins. Much of the subtidal variability in both temperature and velocity appears to be associated with topographic waves that travel counterclockwise around the pair of basins. The observed period of the waves (∼10–20 days) is roughly consistent with that predicted by a barotropic model of free waves in an elliptical basin (Mysak, 1985). Comparison of time series of currents in the upper ({$<$}200 m) water column with those in the lower water column suggests that the waves are forced by the circulation in the upper water column, which is directed over (rather than around) the basins. Seasonal variability was observed in both temperature and velocity fields as deep as 800 m (i.e., below the depth of the deepest sill) along the perimeters of both basins and at midbasin in Santa Monica but not in San Pedro. Temperature increases and salinity and density decrease from spring to fall, consistent with the seasonal development of the poleward flowing California Countercurrent in the upper water column. The seasonal cycle of water properties has significant spatial variability over the basins: the amplitude is a factor of 2 greater on the seaward side of Santa Monica basin than at midbasin and on its coastal edges, and on the edges of San Pedro basin. The variance of the subtidal velocity and temperature fields also exhibit a seasonal signal: maximum variance occurs during fall; minimum variance occurs during spring. Interannual variability dominates the 4-year time series of water properties of the near-bottom water in each basin, and differs somewhat between the two basins. The interannual variability is dominated by events associated with renewal of basin bottom water. Two such events were identified: a minor one in 1987; and a major one in 1988, each beginning in May of that year. In both cases, the actual renewal occurs in less than a month, and the most rapid return to near-normal conditions occurs over a period of about 3–5 months.},

A close relationship between the abundance of the whole copepod population and low oxygen waters was found, with most developmental stages remaining near the base of the oxycline (30–80 m) and within the upper zone of the OMZ (30–200 m). All stages performed DVM but not at all the stations, mainly between the 30–60 and 60–200 m strata; a small fraction (\&lt;20\%) appeared in the surface layer (0–30 m) mostly at night. This strategy of movement would result in a better utilization of food resources since the strong physical and chemical gradients at the base of the oxycline and upper OMZ boundary might serve as a site of particle accumulation. A secondary fluorescence peak was, in fact, found at all the stations, coinciding with minimal dissolved oxygen (DO, \&lt;1 mL O2 L−1) at the base of the oxycline or in the upper OMZ boundary. The relevance of the biogeochemical flux involved in this diel migration pattern was assessed by calculating the potential active input of carbon and nitrogen from the upper layers into deeper the OMZ.},

We describe a library preparation protocol that enables shallow shotgun sequencing at approximately the same per-sample cost as 16S. We used multiple real and simulated biological data sets, including two novel human stool samples with ultra-deep sequencing of 2.5 billion sequences per sample, to demonstrate that shallow shotgun recovers accurate species-level taxonomic and functional profiles of the human microbiome.

IMPORTANCE A common refrain in recent microbiome-related academic meetings is that the field needs to move away from broad taxonomic surveys using 16S sequencing and toward more powerful longitudinal studies using shotgun sequencing. However, performing deep shotgun sequencing in large longitudinal studies remains prohibitively expensive for all but the most well-funded research labs and consortia, which leads many researchers to choose 16S sequencing for large studies, followed by deep shotgun sequencing on a subset of targeted samples. Here, we show that shallow- or moderate-depth shotgun sequencing may be used by researchers to obtain species-level taxonomic and functional data at approximately the same cost as amplicon sequencing. While shallow shotgun sequencing is not intended to replace deep shotgun sequencing for strain-level characterization, we recommend that microbiome scientists consider using shallow shotgun sequencing instead of 16S sequencing for large-scale human microbiome studies.},

The climatological field of the large phytoplankton (diatoms) and small phytoplankton (nano- and picoplankton) showed the model and satellite observation generally agrees in their spatial distribution but showed some biases in the equatorial oceans and higher latitudes. Grid-by-grid correlation derived from the time series of the model and satellite observation showed a significant dependence on latitude, and it was found that lower (higher) correlation coefficients were not necessarily found in the regions where higher (lower) bias was found. Spatial PCA analysis of monthly climatology of PFTs showed that a major spatial pattern of PFTs results from a steady state distribution superimposed by regional seasonal distribution. The model and the satellite observation both showed such seasonality, but we found that the model remarkably showed strong seasonality in the Southern Oceans and the equatorial oceans. The wavelet pattern comparison analysis was applied to quantify the spatial scale(s) at which the agreement in spatial distributions of PFTs can be obtained. The objective skill score determined using the pattern matching/mismatching analysis by the wavelet showed that the model has a skill to represent observed spatial patterns at horizontal scales over 1800 km (i.e. basin and global scale). The agreement is found even at the spatial scales down to 200 km (i.e. meso-scales), when the pigment biomass of the PFTs at the scales is relatively small. Our comparison enabled an objective and quantitative examination of the validity and weakness of the model by clarifying the spatial scale(s) to which the present PFT model has skill, and adds a value on conventional comparison procedure based on univariate statistics.},

  abstract = {Error-quantified, synoptic-scale relationships between chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and phytoplankton pigment groups at the sea surface are presented. A total of ten pigment groups were considered to represent three Phytoplankton Size Classes (PSCs, micro-, nano- and picoplankton) and seven Phytoplankton Functional Types (PFTs, i.e. diatoms, dinoflagellates, green algae, prymnesiophytes (haptophytes), pico-eukaryotes, prokaryotes and Prochlorococcus sp.). The observed relationships between Chl-a and PSCs/PFTs were well-defined at the global scale to show that a community shift of phytoplankton at the basin and global scales is reflected by a change in Chl-a of the total community. Thus, Chl-a of the total community can be used as an index of not only phytoplankton biomass but also of their community structure. Within these relationships, we also found non-monotonic variations with Chl-a for certain pico-sized phytoplankton (pico-eukaryotes, Prokaryotes and Prochlorococcus sp.) and nano-sized phytoplankton (Green algae, prymnesiophytes). The relationships were quantified with a least-square fitting approach in order to enable an estimation of the PFTs from Chl-a where PFTs are expressed as a percentage of the total Chl-a. The estimated uncertainty of the relationships depends on both PFT and Chl-a concentration. Maximum uncertainty of 31.8\% was found for diatoms at Chl-a = 0.49 mg m−3. However, the mean uncertainty of the relationships over all PFTs was 5.9\% over the entire Chl-a range observed in situ (0.02 {$<$} Chl-a {$<$} 4.26 mg m−3). The relationships were applied to SeaWiFS satellite Chl-a data from 1998 to 2009 to show the global climatological fields of the surface distribution of PFTs. Results show that microplankton are present in the mid and high latitudes, constituting only \textasciitilde 10.9\% of the entire phytoplankton community in the mean field for 1998–2009, in which diatoms explain \textasciitilde 7.5\%. Nanoplankton are ubiquitous throughout the global surface oceans, except the subtropical gyres, constituting \textasciitilde 45.5\%, of which prymnesiophytes (haptophytes) are the major group explaining \textasciitilde 31.7\% while green algae contribute \textasciitilde 13.9\%. Picoplankton are dominant in the subtropical gyres, but constitute \textasciitilde 43.6\% globally, of which prokaryotes are the major group explaining \textasciitilde 26.5\% (Prochlorococcus sp. explaining 22.8\%), while pico-eukaryotes explain \textasciitilde 17.2\% and are relatively abundant in the South Pacific. These results may be of use to evaluate global marine ecosystem models.},

We collected sinking POC from a site off Vancouver Island, Canada and found that it contained acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs), a suite of well-known bacterial communication molecules. Furthermore, we observed that the addition of exogenous AHLs to incubations containing sinking POC affected the activity of key hydrolytic enzymes involved in POC degradation in some cases. Our results suggest that AHL-based QS could play an important role in regulating the degradation of sinking POC and that variability in AHL-triggered POC hydrolysis is a heretofore unrecognized process that impacts the marine biological carbon pump.},

  abstract = {Dissolution of marine sediment is a key source of dissolved iron (Fe) that regulates the ocean carbon cycle. Currently, our prevailing understanding, encapsulated in ocean models, focuses on low-oxygen reductive supply mechanisms and neglects the emerging evidence from iron isotopes in seawater and sediment porewaters for additional nonreductive dissolution processes. Here, we combine measurements of Fe colloids and dissolved δ               56               Fe in shallow porewaters spanning the full depth of the South Atlantic Ocean to demonstrate that it is lithogenic colloid production that fuels sedimentary iron supply away from low-oxygen systems. Iron colloids are ubiquitous in these oxic ocean sediment porewaters and account for the lithogenic isotope signature of dissolved Fe (δ               56               Fe = +0.07 ± 0.07‰) within and between ocean basins. Isotope model experiments demonstrate that only lithogenic weathering in both oxic and nitrogenous zones, rather than precipitation or ligand complexation of reduced Fe species, can account for the production of these porewater Fe colloids. The broader covariance between colloidal Fe and organic carbon (OC) abundance suggests that sorption of OC may control the nanoscale stability of Fe minerals by inhibiting the loss of Fe(oxyhydr)oxides to more crystalline minerals in the sediment. Oxic ocean sediments can therefore generate a large exchangeable reservoir of organo-mineral Fe colloids at the sediment water interface (a “rusty source”) that dominates the benthic supply of dissolved Fe to the ocean interior, alongside reductive supply pathways from shallower continental margins.},

The relative abundance of nitrogen over phosphorus (N*) showed a strong seasonal and spatial pattern: gradually decreased from upstream to downstream; high in winter and low in summer. Because the phosphorus concentration remained relatively stable, the spatiotemporal pattern of N* implied that a substantial fraction of DIN was removed in the bay, especially in summer. Correlation analyses indicated the functional microbial communities and environmental variables, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, played important roles for connecting the seasonal variation of N*. Among them, temperature was the trigger factor. High temperature in the summer induced the growth of functional microbes, which subsequently consumed a large portion of DIN inputted from the tributaries and reduced the N*. The current study provided the relative importance of microbial communities and environmental variables in driving the DIN loss in the bay.},

  abstract = {Particulate organic carbon (POC) is vertically transported to the oceanic interior by aggregates and their ballasts, mainly CaCO3 and biogenic opal, with a smaller role for lithogenic aerosols through the mesopelagic zone. Diel migrating zooplankton communities effect vertical transport and remineralization of POC in the upper layers of the ocean. Below 1.5 km, the presence of zooplankton is reduced and thus the aggregates travel mainly by gravitational transport. We normalized the fluxes of POC, CaCO3, and biogenic opal from data published on samples collected at 134 globally distributed, bottom-tethered, time-series sediment trap (TS-trap) stations to annual mole fluxes at the mesopelagic/bathypelagic boundary (m/b) at 2 km and defined them as Fm/bCorg, Fm/bCinorg, and Fm/bSibio. Using this global data set, we investigated (1) the geographic contrasts of POC export at m/b and (2) the supply rate of ∑CO2 to the world mesopelagic water column. Fm/bCorg varies from 25 (Pacific Warm Pool) to 605 (divergent Arabian Sea) mmolC m−2 yr−1; Fm/bCinorg varies from \&gt;8 (high latitude Polar Oceans) or 15 (Pacific Warm Pool) to 459 (divergent Arabian Sea) mmolC m−2 yr−1; and Fm/bSibio, the most spatially/temporally variable flux, ranges from 6 (North Atlantic Drift) to 1118 (Pacific Subarctic Gyre) mmolSi m−2 yr−1. The oceanic region exhibiting the highest POC flux over a significantly large region is the area of the North Pacific Boreal Gyres where the average Fm/bCorg = 213, Fm/bCinorg = 126, and Fm/bSibio = 578 mmol m−2 yr−1. Fm/bCorg and Fm/bCinorg are particularly high in large upwelling margins, including the divergent Arabian Sea and off Cape Verde. One of the data sets showing the lowest flux over a significant region/basin is Fm/bCorg = 39, Fm/bCinorg = 69, and Fm/bSibio = 22 mmol m−2 yr−1 in the North Pacific subtropical/tropical gyres; Pan-Atlantic average fluxes are similar except Fm/bSibio fluxes are even lower. Where Corg/Cinorg and Sibio/Cinorg are \&lt;1 defines the “Carbonate Ocean”, and where these ratios are ⩾1 defines the “Silica Ocean”. The Carbonate Ocean occupies about 80\% of the present world pelagic ocean between the two major oceanographic fronts, the North Pacific Polar Front and the Antarctic Polar Front, and the Silica Ocean is found on the polar sides of these fronts. The total global annual fluxes of Fm/bCorg, Fm/bCinorg, and Fm/bSibio at m/b calculated by parameterizations of the export flux data from 134 stations are surprisingly similar; 36.2, 33.8, and 34.6 teramol yr−1 (120, 112, and 114 mmol m−2 yr−1), respectively, resulting in a near uniform binary ratio between the above three elements of about one. The global ternary \% ratios estimated from 152 TS-trap samples of the three elements are 35:32:33. From our global Fm/bCorg and a published model estimate of the global export production, we estimate the regeneration rate of CO2 through the mesopelagic zone by the biological pump is 441 teramolC yr−1. Based on our global Fm/bCinorg and recently estimated global primary production of PIC, 36–86 teramolC yr−1 of PIC is assumed to be dissolved within the upper 2 km of the water column.},

Salmonella spp. were not, however, present in any sample containing less than 230 fecal coliforms per 100 g. Analysis of the data suggests that low fecal coliform levels in both fresh and stored oysters are good indicators of the absence of Salmonella spp., but that high levels of fecal coliforms are somewhat limited in predicting the presence of Salmonella spp. E. coli levels correlated very strongly with fecal coliform levels in both fresh and stored oysters and clams, suggesting that there is no advantage in replacing fecal coliforms with E. coli as an indicator of shellfish quality.},

  abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

  abstract = {The eastern tropical North Pacific (ETNP) is a large region of anoxic water that hosts widespread water column N loss (denitrification). There is some disagreement about the long-term trends of denitrification and anoxia and long-term studies of water column denitrification within the anoxic zone are lacking. In this study, we compared ETNP water column nitrite, N*, and O2 data along the same transect for four studies ranging from 1972 to 2012. Anoxic water volume increased, and low-oxygen conditions expanded into shallower isopycnals from 1972 to 2012. A geochemical marker for cumulative N loss indicates that denitrification was highest in 2012 and the upper oxygen-deficient zone (ODZ) experienced the most change. Oxygen and N loss changes in the world's largest ODZ for 2012 could not be explained by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and decreased O2 in supply currents and increased wind-driven upwelling are likely mechanisms contributing to increased N loss and anoxia.},

  abstract = {Spore-forming bacteria are of particular concern in the context of planetary protection because their tough endospores may withstand certain sterilization procedures as well as the harsh environments of outer space or planetary surfaces. To test their hardiness on a hypothetical mission to Mars, spores of Bacillus subtilis 168 and Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 were exposed for 1.5 years to selected parameters of space in the experiment PROTECT during the EXPOSE-E mission on board the International Space Station. Mounted as dry layers on spacecraft-qualified aluminum coupons, the “trip to Mars” spores experienced space vacuum, cosmic and extraterrestrial solar radiation, and temperature fluctuations, whereas the “stay on Mars” spores were subjected to a simulated martian environment that included atmospheric pressure and composition, and UV and cosmic radiation. The survival of spores from both assays was determined after retrieval. It was clearly shown that solar extraterrestrial UV radiation (λ≥110\,nm) as well as the martian UV spectrum (λ≥200\,nm) was the most deleterious factor applied; in some samples only a few survivors were recovered from spores exposed in monolayers. Spores in multilayers survived better by several orders of magnitude. All other environmental parameters encountered by the “trip to Mars” or “stay on Mars” spores did little harm to the spores, which showed about 50\% survival or more. The data demonstrate the high chance of survival of spores on a Mars mission, if protected against solar irradiation. These results will have implications for planetary protection considerations.

Despite the ecological importance of bacteria, past practical and theoretical constraints have limited our ability to document patterns of bacterial diversity and to understand the processes that determine these patterns. However, recent advances in molecular techniques that allow more thorough detection of bacteria in nature have made it possible to examine such patterns and processes. Here, we review recent studies of the distribution of free-living bacterial diversity and compare our current understanding with what is known about patterns in plant and animal diversity. From these recent studies a preliminary picture is emerging: bacterial diversity may exhibit regular patterns, and in some cases these patterns may be qualitatively similar to those observed for plants and animals.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are major primary producers in coastal microbial mats and provide biochemical energy, organic carbon, and bound nitrogen to the mat community through oxygenic photosynthesis and dinitrogen fixation. In order to anticipate the specific requirements to optimize their metabolism and growth during a day-and-night cycle, Cyanobacteria possess a unique molecular timing mechanism known as the circadian clock that is well-studied under laboratory conditions but little is known about its function in a natural complex community. Here, we investigated daily rhythmicity of gene expression in a coastal microbial mat community sampled at 6 time points during a 24-h period. In order to identify diel expressed genes, meta-transcriptome data was fitted to periodic functions. Out of 24,035 conserved gene transcript clusters, approximately 7\% revealed a significant rhythmic expression pattern. These rhythmic genes were assigned to phototrophic micro-eukaryotes, Cyanobacteria but also to Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Analysis of MG-RAST annotated genes and mRNA recruitment analysis of two cyanobacterial and three proteobacterial microbial mat members confirmed that homologs of the cyanobacterial circadian clock genes were also found in other bacterial members of the microbial mat community. These results suggest that various microbial mat members other than Cyanobacteria have their own molecular clock, which can be entrained by a cocktail of Zeitgebers such as light, temperature or metabolites from neighboring species. Hence, microbial mats can be compared to a complex organism consisting of multiple sub-systems that have to be entrained in a cooperative way such that the corpus functions optimally., Mixed populations in microbial mats can have cooperative cycles of gene expression like daily circadian rhythms in individual organisms. Henk Bolhuis and colleagues at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research in the Netherlands studied variations in gene expression in a coastal microbial mat by sampling every six hours in a 24-h period. More than 1000 genes from a variety of microorganisms displayed circadian-like variation, indicative of coherent “molecular clock” processes governed by the 24-h day. The results suggest that microbial mats can be compared to more complex organisms that have different systems working in a cooperative and synchronized manner for the overall advantage of the constituent parts. This extends knowledge of microbial molecular clocks beyond the cyanobacteria and some algae, which until now were the only microorganisms known to display such activity.},

  abstract = {The large volumes of sequencing data required to sample deeply the microbial communities of complex environments pose new challenges to sequence analysis. De novo metagenomic assembly effectively reduces the total amount of data to be analyzed but requires substantial computational resources. We combine two preassembly filtering approaches—digital normalization and partitioning—to generate previously intractable large metagenome assemblies. Using a human-gut mock community dataset, we demonstrate that these methods result in assemblies nearly identical to assemblies from unprocessed data. We then assemble two large soil metagenomes totaling 398 billion bp (equivalent to 88,000 Escherichia coli genomes) from matched Iowa corn and native prairie soils. The resulting assembled contigs could be used to identify molecular interactions and reaction networks of known metabolic pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Orthology database. Nonetheless, more than 60\% of predicted proteins in assemblies could not be annotated against known databases. Many of these unknown proteins were abundant in both corn and prairie soils, highlighting the benefits of assembly for the discovery and characterization of novelty in soil biodiversity. Moreover, 80\% of the sequencing data could not be assembled because of low coverage, suggesting that considerably more sequencing data are needed to characterize the functional content of soil.},

Current sequence-based methods provide unprecedented access to uncultivated microorganisms, allowing prediction of previously cryptic roles in biogeochemical cycles and interactions within communities. A renewed focus on cultivation-based methods is required to test predictions derived from environmental sequence data sets and to address the exponential increase in genes lacking predicted functions.

  abstract = {BackgroundMany technological, biological, social, and information networks fall into the broad class of ‘small-world’ networks: they have tightly interconnected clusters of nodes, and a shortest mean path length that is similar to a matched random graph (same number of nodes and edges). This semi-quantitative definition leads to a categorical distinction (‘small/not-small’) rather than a quantitative, continuous grading of networks, and can lead to uncertainty about a network's small-world status. Moreover, systems described by small-world networks are often studied using an equivalent canonical network model – the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model. However, the process of establishing an equivalent WS model is imprecise and there is a pressing need to discover ways in which this equivalence may be quantified.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe defined a precise measure of ‘small-world-ness’ S based on the trade off between high local clustering and short path length. A network is now deemed a ‘small-world’ if S{$>$}1 - an assertion which may be tested statistically. We then examined the behavior of S on a large data-set of real-world systems. We found that all these systems were linked by a linear relationship between their S values and the network size n. Moreover, we show a method for assigning a unique Watts-Strogatz (WS) model to any real-world network, and show analytically that the WS models associated with our sample of networks also show linearity between S and n. Linearity between S and n is not, however, inevitable, and neither is S maximal for an arbitrary network of given size. Linearity may, however, be explained by a common limiting growth process.Conclusions/SignificanceWe have shown how the notion of a small-world network may be quantified. Several key properties of the metric are described and the use of WS canonical models is placed on a more secure footing.},

  abstract = {In estuaries and coastal waters, fine particles are transported as aggregates with size and settling properties controlled by coagulation and breakup mechanisms. A review of the separation sciences literature on emulsion and aggregate breakup in turbulent fluids reveals considerable theoretical and experimental uncertainty, but the importance of inhomogeneities in reactor turbulence near walls and rotating elements is recognized. Predictions of droplet and floe sizes have not accounted for this inhomogeneity except through questionable assumptions of breakup kinetics. Available clay coagulation and breakup data in seawater systems indicate that clay aggregates are relatively fragile and low fluid shear rates of 8 s-1 are sufficient to decrease overall removal kinetics because aggregate sizes are limited by breakup. Calculations indicate that aggregate deposition in estuaries is controlled by breakup processes occurring within the viscous sublayer rather than aggregate dynamics calculated from mean fluid properties.},

  abstract = {Bacteria and their viruses (phage) are fundamental drivers of many ecosystem processes including global biogeochemistry and horizontal gene transfer. While databases and resources for studying function in uncultured bacterial communities are relatively advanced, many fewer exist for their viral counterparts. The issue is largely technical in that the majority (often 90\%) of viral sequences are functionally ‘unknown’ making viruses a virtually untapped resource of functional and physiological information. Here, we provide a community resource that organizes this unknown sequence space into 27 K high confidence protein clusters using 32 viral metagenomes from four biogeographic regions in the Pacific Ocean that vary by season, depth, and proximity to land, and include some of the first deep pelagic ocean viral metagenomes. These protein clusters more than double currently available viral protein clusters, including those from environmental datasets. Further, a protein cluster guided analysis of functional diversity revealed that richness decreased (i) from deep to surface waters, (ii) from winter to summer, (iii) and with distance from shore in surface waters only. These data provide a framework from which to draw on for future metadata-enabled functional inquiries of the vast viral unknown.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of hydrolytic activities by bacterial extracellular enzymes (EE) in the temperate ocean, little is known about the role of extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) in determining the fate of particulate organic matter (POM) in polar seas. To explore the issue further, we measured various chemical and bacterial parameters in the near-0°C waters of the North Water during the months of May and July of 1998. Seawater (SW) samples were collected by Niskin bottle at the depth of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (8–90m), while samples of sinking particles and aggregates were collected in short-term (0.5–1.2d), unpoisoned, floating sediment traps deployed at depths typically below the mixed layer (50–136m). Samples were analyzed for POC, PON, and abundance of total and actively respiring bacteria. They were also incubated with fluorescently tagged substrate analogs to measure potential maximal rates of three classes of EE (leucine-aminopeptidase, chitobiase, and β-glucosidase) at –1°C. The percentage of actively respiring bacteria was always higher in sediment trap samples than in SW (medians of 38\% and 24\% versus 10\% and 12\% in May and July, respectively). Cell-specific rates of EEA were also higher in the trap samples and, for both sample types, similar to published rates from temperate waters. Rates of EEA when scaled to the abundance of actively respiring bacteria, however, did not differ between sample types, suggesting that the elevated EEA associated with sinking material is due to the greater abundance of metabolically active cells supported by such material and not due to enhanced enzyme expression in general, as suggested by previous studies. In this study, leucine-aminopeptidase activity was always much higher than the other classes of EEA, becoming even more dominant later in the season; it always correlated positively with the abundance of both total and actively respiring bacteria. Enzyme ratios indicating protease dominance corresponded with the seasonal increases in C/N ratios of both suspended and sinking POM. Overall the results suggest bacterial responses to seasonal changes in POM quality through differential expression of EE and an important role for proteases in influencing the nitrogen content of organic matter even at near-0° temperatures in this polynya.},

  abstract = {Diazotrophic marine cyanobacteria in the genus Trichodesmium contribute a large fraction of the new nitrogen entering the oligotrophic oceans, but little is known about how they respond to shifts in global change variables such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature. We compared Trichodesmium dinitrogen (N-2) and CO2 fixation rates during steady-state growth under past, current, and future CO2 scenarios, and at two relevant temperatures. At projected CO2 levels of year 2100 (76 Pa, 750 ppm), N-2 fixation rates of Pacific and Atlantic isolates increased 35-100\%, and CO2 fixation rates increased 15-128\% relative to present day CO2 conditions (39 Pa, 380 ppm). CO2- mediated rate increases were of similar relative magnitude in both phosphorus (P)-replete and P-limited cultures, suggesting that this effect may be independent of resource limitation. Neither isolate could grow at 15 Pa (150 ppm) CO2, but N-2 and CO2 fixation rates, growth rates, and nitrogen : phosophorus (N : P) ratios all increased significantly between 39 Pa and 152 Pa (1500 ppm). In contrast, these parameters were affected only minimally or not at all by a 4 degrees C temperature change. Photosynthesis versus irradiance parameters, however, responded to both CO2 and temperature but in different ways for each isolate. These results suggest that by the end of this century, elevated CO2 could substantially increase global Trichodesmium N-2 and CO2 fixation, fundamentally altering the current marine N and C cycles and potentially driving some oceanic regimes towards P limitation. CO2 limitation of Trichodesmium diazotrophy during past glacial periods could also have contributed to setting minimum atmospheric CO2 levels through downregulation of the biological pump. The relationship between marine N-2 fixation and atmospheric CO2 concentration appears to be more complex than previously realized and needs to be considered in the context of the rapidly changing oligotrophic oceans.},

However, there is a lack study on these shrimp gut bacterial community compared to Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Our study represents the first attempt to i) characterize the gut bacterial community of P. monodon and F. merguiensis broodstocks caught from the wild using PCR-DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) fingerprinting, and ii) compare the gut bacterial community of both species using cluster analysis. Gut bacterial community related with P. monodon was more diverse and dissimilar to those of P. merguiensis from the results of DGGE fingerprinting and cluster analysis. The sequences from DGGE bands showed that Vibrio, Photobacterium, and Fusobacteria were composed of core bacterial member in both shrimp gut, whereas Clostridia, Mollicutes and Ferrimonas spp. were only found in the gut of P. monodon. Our comparative analysis by means of cluster analysis revealed significant difference in the gut bacterial community between wild-caught P. monodon and P. merguiensis broodstocks, suggesting the possibility of host species-specific gut bacterial community. This study might be a stepping stone to develop host health management and improvement program, specifically for shrimp broodstock aquaculture.},

  abstract = {* 1A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. * 2Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: ‘traditional’ food webs, mutualistic networks and host–parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host–parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. * 3Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. * 4Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. * 5We conclude by suggesting a number of ‘dead ends’ and ‘fruitful avenues’ for future research into ecological networks.},

  abstract = {This thesis aims to identify and estimate the significance of lateral transport of particulate organic matter in the deep water-column of the Benguela upwelling system (BUS) offshore southwestern Africa. Although the BUS is regarded as the most productive of the four major eastern boundary systems of the ocean, and therefore of high importance for the global marine carbon cycle, little information is available on processes and fluxes involved in particulate matter transport in this area. Above the continental slope, water layers strongly enriched in particle content are identified in intermediate water depths and in the lowermost water column. These layers are termed intermediate and bottom nepheloid layers (INLs and BNLs, respectively). In such layers, the major part of the advective particle transport is supposed to take place. A pronounced BNL covers the entire study area with maximum intensity above the outer shelf and at the shelf break. The detachment of this BNL at the shelf break feeds a major INL in 250 to 400 m water depth at 25.5Ã °S, positioned at the lower boundary of the oxygen minimum zone. Together, these strong subsurface nepheloid layers are indicators of intensive lateral particle transport from the outer shelf towards a depocenter of organic matter (OM) on the upper continental slope. The results on distribution, transport and quality of organic matter presented in this thesis confirm the major significance of lateral transport of pre-aged, but well-preserved organic particles in the highly-productive Benguela upwelling area. Many indications suggest that the results from this study are also applicable to other continental margin settings. For example, high 14C-ages of SPM and the deposition of OC-rich sediments with high hydrocarbon potential on the upper continental slope is also known from other high-productive areas of the modern ocean. Thus, the results may improve our understanding of the genesis of black shales and petroleum source rocks in the geological record, to which these depocenters may represent a modern analogue. Additionally, it is shown that advective processes have the potential to displace areas of enhanced OC burial effectively from maximum production cells along the coast towards the slope and possibly the deep-sea. These results limit the validity of often used, merely vertically oriented particle flux models. The findings from the BUS identify lateral transport as an important, yet hardly recognized, secondary mechanism, effectively transferring carbon from the atmosphere to long-term sequestration in the sediments. Therewith, the results contribute to the improvement of global models to predict the impact of environmental changes on the oceanic system.},

Budget calculations of the biological carbon pump are heavily based on the ratio between carbon export (sedimentation) and remineralization (release to the atmosphere). Current methodologies determine microbial dynamics on POM using closed vessels, which are strongly biased towards heterotrophy due to rapidly changing water chemistry (Bottle Effect). We developed a flow-through rolling tank for long term studies that continuously maintains POM at near in-situ conditions. There, bacterial communities resembled in-situ communities and greatly differed from those in the closed systems. The active particle-associated community in the flow-through system was stable for days, contrary to hours previously reported for closed incubations. In contrast to enhanced respiration rates, the decrease in photosynthetic rates on particles throughout the incubation was much slower in our system than in traditional ones. These results call for reevaluating experimentally-derived carbon fluxes estimated using traditional methods.},

  abstract = {Strong correlations between particulate organic carbon (POC) and ballast minerals have been observed in the deep ocean. This has led to the postulation that ballast minerals can enhance POC flux by increasing the density and sinking velocity of ballasted aggregates and/or that ballast minerals protect the aggregated organic matter from degradation. Here we experimentally tested the influence of the ballast mineral smectite on the formation, size, dry weight, size-specific sinking velocity, carbon-specific respiration rate, and total POC flux of marine snow aggregates formed in roller tanks from a natural plankton community isolated from the North Sea. This study shows that the inclusion of smectite offers no protection against degradation of organic matter in freshly produced or aged marine snow aggregates. The main effect of ballasting with smectite was an increase in the density of the aggregates and, therefore 2- to 3-fold higher size-specific sinking velocities. Mineral ballasting had no influence on the total volume of aggregates or the total aggregated amount of POC Nevertheless, the effect of increased sinking velocities in the ballasted treatment resulted in 2.7 +/- 1.6 times larger potential POC fluxes compared to the non-ballasted aggregates. This implies that the incorporation of ballast minerals into sinking organic aggregates can increase the efficiency of the biological pump. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Vertical carbon fluxes between the surface and 2500 m depth were estimated from in situ profiles of particle size distributions and abundances me/asured off Cape Blanc (Mauritania) related to deep ocean sediment traps. Vertical mass fluxes off Cape Blanc were significantly higher than recent global estimates in the open ocean. The aggregates off Cape Blanc contained high amounts of ballast material due to the presence of coccoliths and fine-grained dust from the Sahara desert, leading to a dominance of small and fast-settling aggregates. The largest changes in vertical fluxes were observed in the surface waters (\&lt;250 m), and, thus, showing this site to be the most important zone for aggregate formation and degradation. The degradation length scale (L), i.e. the fractional degradation of aggregates per meter settled, was estimated from vertical fluxes derived from the particle size distribution through the water column. This was compared with fractional remineralization rate of aggregates per meter settled derived from direct ship-board measurements of sinking velocity and small-scale O2 fluxes to aggregates measured by micro-sensors. Microbial respiration by attached bacteria alone could not explain the degradation of organic matter in the upper ocean. Instead, flux feeding from zooplankton organisms was indicated as the dominant degradation process of aggregated carbon in the surface ocean. Below the surface ocean, microbes became more important for the degradation as zooplankton was rare at these depths.},

This study presents direct measurements of formation, degradation, and sinking velocity of diatom aggregates from laboratory studies performed at 15 °C and 4 °C during a three-week experiment. The average carbon-specific respiration rate during the experiment was 0.12 ± 0.03 at 15 °C, and decreased 3.5-fold when the temperature was lowered to 4 °C. No direct influence of temperature on aggregate sinking speed was observed. Using the remineralisation rate measured at 4 °C and an average particle sinking speed of 150 m d−1, calculated carbon fluxes were similar to those collected in deep ocean sediment traps from a global data set, indicating that temperature plays a major role for deep ocean fluxes of POC.},

  abstract = {The spatial distribution of chemical elements in the ocean is controlled by particles (including organisms); aggregation controls the particle properties. Coagulation is an important mechanism for controlling the size of marine particles and thereby their transport properties. Coagulation theory has provided a framework for the calculation of aggregation rates and size distributions. The use of fractal scaling to relate aggregate length to mass has been an important development that still needs to be fully incorporated into mathematical expressions for particle collision rates. In addition, disaggregation has emerged as an important process that is poorly described mathematically. Observations of particle spectra in the ocean are in general agreement with those expected for coagulation processes but tend to be for too small a size range to include the effects of particle disaggregation. Analysis of material caught in sediment traps suggests that aggregates are the dominant form of material falling through the ocean. An important aspect of the marine system is the presence of multiple particle sources that can confound fractal scaling based on single source particles. Coupled coagulation and chemical reaction models have become important tools in the interpretation of Th distributions. Further development of coagulation theory to describe marine systems promises to push the limits of our understanding of coagulation processes and their implications.},

  abstract = {The increasing appreciation of the importance of aggregates in transport of material through the ocean makes understanding their formation and movement crucial. Coagulation theory has the potential to explain key aspects of oceanic particle dynamics. Unfortunately, there are uncertainties about the best way to formulate coagulation theory in marine systems. A mesocosm experiment in which members of the SIGMA (Significant Interactions Generating Marine Aggregates) program grew marine phytoplankton and observed the changes in particle size spectra provides information needed to test different formulations of coagulation rates. Computer simulations incorporating coagulation theory were able to predict aspects of the particle size spectral evolution. The rectilinear formulation of coagulation kernels over-predicted coagulation rates, particularly because of high interaction rates between particles of much different sizes. The curvilinear formulation worked better, especially if used in conjunction with a disaggregation model. Disaggregation was a very important process regulating particle size spectra that was necessary to include in the simulations. The derived disaggregation rates were consistent with past observations of marine snow disaggregation. The simulations in which coagulation and disaggregation predicted the observed results best were those for which the dominant aggregation was between similar sized particles. The largest discrepancies between observed and predicted particle size spectra occurred when theory predicted that dominant interactions were between widely different particle sizes. While coagulation theory was useful in predicting particle size spectra for this experiment, there are still improvements needed in the theory.},

  abstract = {Coagulation is the formation of large particles from multiple collisions of smaller ones. Because larger particles fall faster than smaller ones, coagulation can be important in accelerating the export of organic matter from the ocean’s surface to the deep sea and has the potential to limit phytoplankton populations. We have developed a model of an algal bloom that includes nutrient and light limitation of algal growth rate and coagulation of single algal cells. The results show two effects of coagulation on the growth model. Loss of dividing cells to coagulating particles can occur when algal cells are growing at a fairly constant rate, placing a cap on the concentrations that algae can achieve. The second effect is enhancement of vertical particle flux from the surface mixed layer in aggregates. This enhanced transport moves algal biomass from the surface mixed layer over shorter periods at rates far greater than those associated with settling of single cells. For example, half the material associated with a bloom of 2-µm-radius algae, which would take 350 d to settle out as isolated cells, took 42 d as aggregates. Aggregation was not limited to the large algae, although the rate was slower for the smaller ones. Coagulation was enhanced by higher initial nutrient concentrations, deeper mixed layers, and higher shear rates. Vertical transport associated with aggregation has the potential to be an important mechanism for removing biological material from eutrophic regions.},

  abstract = {The different drainage basins of large rivers such as the Mississippi River represent interesting systems in which to study patterns in freshwater microbial biogeography. Spatial variability in bacterioplankton communities in six major rivers (the Upper Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas) of the Mississippi River Basin was characterized using Ion Torrent 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. When all systems were combined, particle-associated ({$>$}3 micron) bacterial assemblages were different from free-living bacterioplankton in terms of overall community structure, partly because of differences in the proportional abundance of sequences affiliated with major bacterial lineages (Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes). Both particle-associated and free-living communities ordinated by river system, a pattern that was apparent even after rare sequences or those affiliated with Cyanobacteria were removed from the analyses. Ordination of samples by river system correlated with environmental characteristics of each river, such as nutrient status and turbidity. Communities in the Upper Mississippi and the Missouri, and the Ohio and the Tennessee, pairs of rivers that join each other, contained similar taxa in terms of presence/absence data, but differed in the proportional abundance of major lineages. The most common sequence types detected in particle-associated communities were picocyanobacteria in the Syn/Pro clade, while free-living communities also contained a high proportion of LD12 (SAR11/Pelagibacter)-like Alphaproteobacteria. This research shows that while different tributaries of large river systems such as the Mississippi River harbor distinct bacterioplankton communities, there is also microhabitat variation such as that between free-living and particle-associated assemblages.},

Descriptions of the carbon flux as a function of depth have focused on empirical relationships that neglect biological processes that might control them. We develop here a series of simple models of the region that describe changes in flux in terms of the population dynamics of a particle feeder and its predator. One model predicts that the flux and predator concentration at steady state decrease exponentially with depth while the concentration of the particle feeders is constant; a second predicts that flux, particle feeder, and predator concentrations are proportional and decrease at rates that are approximately inversely proportional to depth. Away from steady state, variations in particle flux leaving the surface can induce oscillations in the near-surface animal populations but not the deeper populations. As a result of the animal oscillations associated with the surface flux variations, there can be large swings in the deep vertical particle flux that are not synchronized to the surface variations for one model formulation; a second formulation predicts that fluctuations in surface flux are damped out near the bottom. The differences in predictions for the various models make it possible to verify the utility of one or the other formulation.},

These aggregates take many forms and undoubtedly have many causes. One form frequently described is that composed of algae, usually diatoms, occurring after an algal bloom. A model combining kinetic coagulation theory and simple algal growth kinetics describes the dynamics of such an algal bloom. Results show this to be a two-state system in which coagulation processes are either unimportant when algal concentrations are low or dominant when they are high, with a rapid transition between the two states. Critical algal concentration for this transition is inversely related to fluid shear, algal size and stickiness, and is similar to values observed after a bloom. The role of coagulation in controlling particle dynamics for more complicated aquatic systems will depend on other biological particle production and consumption processes, such as zooplankton feeding and defecation. These results emphasize the importance of measuring algal sizes and abundances when studying floc formation.},

  abstract = {Echinoderms are prone to large population fluctuations that can be mediated by pervasive disease events. For the majority of echinoderm disease events the causative pathogen is unknown. Viruses have only recently been explored as potential pathogens using culture-independent techniques though little information currently exists on echinoderm viruses. In this study, ten circular ssDNA viruses were discovered in tissues among an asteroid (Asterias forbesi), an echinoid (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) and a holothurian (Parastichopus californicus) using viral metagenomics. Genome architecture and sequence similarity place these viruses among the rapidly expanding circular rep-encoding single stranded (CRESS) DNA viral group. Multiple genomes from the same tissue were no more similar in sequence identity to each other than when compared to other known CRESS DNA viruses. The results from this study are the first to describe a virus from a holothurian and continue to show the ubiquity of these viruses among aquatic invertebrates.},

  abstract = {We deployed autonomous particle-sensing SOLOPC floats more than eight times during five cruises, amassing almost 400 profiles of particle size (d{$>$}90μm) and abundance between the ocean surface and 100m. The profiles consistently had subsurface maxima in particle volume. The median (by volume) equivalent spherical diameter for the particle distribution was 0.4–0.8mm and increased with depth in a manner similar to that observed in coagulation simulations. There was a sharp cutoff at the bottom of the high particle concentration region. Estimation of particle fluxes made using the size distributions show an increasing downward movement through the particle field above the sharp particle cutoff. The increase of particle flux with depth through the euphotic zone implies a partial spatial separation of production and consumption. The sharp drop in particle volume and flux implies that the base of the particle-rich zone is a region of active particle consumption, possibly by zooplankton flux feeding. Our data show greater concentrations of zooplankton-type particles relative to marine snow-type particles below the particle maximum. Such behavior could explain why zooplankton are frequently observed at and immediately below the particle maximum rather than the productivity maximum and suggests an important role for flux feeding in carbon and nutrient cycling at the base of the particle maximum. This implies that zooplankton act as gatekeepers for the movement of organic matter to the mesopelagic. The ability of the SOLOPC to sample hourly with high resolution in the upper 100m of the ocean provides a powerful complement for the study of particles where it has been difficult to use sediment traps.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of elements in the water column is complex, depending on multiple biological and physical processes operating at very different physical scales. Coagulation of particulate material is important for transforming particles and moving them in the water column. Mechanistic models of coagulation processes provide a means to predict these processes, help interpret observations, and provide insight into the processes occurring. However, most model applications have focused on describing simple marine systems and mechanisms. We argue that further model development, in close collaboration with field and experimental scientists, is required in order to extend the models to describe the large-scale elemental distributions and interactions being studied as part of GEOTRACES. Models that provide a fundamental description of trace element–particle interactions are required as are experimental tests of the mechanisms involved and the predictions arising from models. However, a comparison between simple and complicated models of aggregation and trace metal provides a means for understanding the implications of simplifying assumptions and providing guidance as to which simplifications are needed.},

  abstract = {Fractal scaling is usually presented as a relationship between aggregate mass and length. Such scaling can also be expressed as a relationship between the lengths of two particles that collide and the length of the resulting aggregate. Emphasizing fractal scaling as a geometric property allows the extension of fractal description to aggregates composed of more than one type of source particle. In particular, it allows the development of more complete models of the role of coagulation in marine ecosystems. The classical aggregation equations can be modified to accommodate a two-dimensional particle size spectrum. This two-dimensional set of equations can be solved using a modification of the sectional approach. Because moving to two-dimensions vastly increases the number of possible interactions and makes solution more computationally costly, simplifications that decrease the allowable interactions considerably speed up the calculations for relatively little loss of accuracy.},

The number of bacteria associated with the fecal pellet then steadily declined to I x 104 cells per fecal pellet in 4 days. The sinking of fecal pellets through a column of seawater increased the rate of initial colonization. The growth rates of bacteria associated with fecal pellets and those free in the water were not significantly different. Bacteria in I I'm filtrates of seawater mineralized copepod fecal pellet carbon to CO, at 0.5\% day-t. Inclusion of microzooplankton (35 I'm filtrate) doubled the rate of mineralization. If our laboratory results can be extrapolated to the natural environment, they would suggest that bacteria colonizing fecal pellets in the euphotic zone may not be the major group responsible for carbon mineralization in the upper 300 m of the water column.},

We performed three, 1-week in situ experiments in March-April (expt 1), May (expt 2) and August (expt 3) 2003 in order to assess protozoan and virus-induced mortality of heterotrophic bacteria in a French lake. Viral and bacterial abundances were obtained using flow cytometry (FCM) while protozoa were counted using epifluorescence microscopy (EFM). 2. A dilution approach, applied to pretreated grazer-free samples, allowed us to estimate that viral lysis could be responsible for 60\% (expt 1), 35\% (expt 2) and 52\% (expt 3) of daily heterotrophic bacterial mortality. Flagellate (both mixotrophic and heterotrophic) grazing in untreated samples, was responsible for 56\% (expt 1), 63\% (expt 2) and 18\% (expt 3) of daily heterotrophic bacteria removal. 3. These results therefore suggest that both viral lysis and flagellate grazing had a strong impact on bacterial mortality, and this impact varied seasonally. 4. From parallel transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, we found that the burst size (i.e. the number of viruses potentially released per lysed cell) ranged from nine to 25 (expt 1), 10 to 35 (expt 2) and eight to 25 (expt 3). The percentage of infected heterotrophic bacteria was 5.7\% (expt 1), 3.4\% (expt 2) and 5.7\% (expt 3) so that the calculated percentage of bacterial mortality induced by viruses was 6.3\% (expt 1), 3.7\% (expt 2) and 6.3\% (expt 3). 5. It is clear that the dilution-FCM and TEM methods yielded different estimates of viral impact, although both methods revealed an increased impact of viruses during summer.},

This tragic case highlights the potential for catastrophic consequences from person-to-person transmission of bacterial pathogens in CF. This report and others from around the world that also described person-to-person transmission of B cepacia associated with acceleration of pulmonary disease and death led to the recommendation that people infected with B cepacia not attend Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CF Foundation)-sponsored events. Reports describing person-to-person transmission of other more prevalent CF pathogens, most notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa, soon followed. In response, the CF Foundation published recommendations for infection prevention and control in 2003.2 Over the last 10 years, accumulating evidence has described further instances of person-to-person transmission of CF pathogens as well as poor clinical outcomes associated with transmission of certain strains of P aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Burkholderia.3 In response, the CF Foundation commissioned an update of the guidelines and invited public comment on a draft version.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The Northeastern Arabian Sea (NEAS) is a recognized region of intense denitrification, with a 200 to 1200 m anoxic water column. We studied the abundance of bacteria, viral particles and the bacterial community (BC), in addition to various chemical and other biological parameters from the Arabian Sea Time Series (ASTS) station. Water samples from surface, deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), 250, 500 and 1000 m were collected during spring intermonsoon (SIM), fall intermonsoon (FIM), and northeast monsoon (NEM) seasons and analyzed for various parameters. Bacterial abundance varied seasonally (p ≤ 0.05), with the highest abundance observed during FIM at all sampling depths. Conversely, seasonal variations in viral abundance were minimal, though a significant correlation between viral and bacterial abundance (r = 0.526, p {$<$} 0.05, n = 14) was found. Hierarchical clustering of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles revealed clear patterns of vertical, as well as temporal, partitioning of the BC during all 3 seasons. The BC varied seasonally both in the surface and DCM, whereas in the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ; 250 to 1000 m) it was more or less identical during all 3 seasons in spite of significant seasonal variation in bacterial abundance, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in the OMZ. Following band-matching, several DGGE bands were excised and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria as the dominant bacterial groups at the ASTS location. Linkage tree (LINKTREE) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were performed to decipher the effect of environmental factors on the BC. From these analyses, it appears that DO and total organic carbon (TOC) are responsible for vertical separation of the BC between the surface and the OMZ. Our results suggest seasonal variation in the BC occurs in the surface layers, with minimal temporal differences in the OMZ.},

The objectives of KERFIX are (1) to monitor the ocean/atmosphere CO2 and O2 exchanges and to understand which processes govern these exchanges (2) to observe and interpret the seasonal and interannual variability of the production, flux, decomposition and dissolution of carbon and associated elements at this location. In addition, micropaleontological studies describe the present and past flux dynamics in this oceanic area, to improve the knowledge of the transfer functions of some oceanographic proxies. This paper presents a survey of the KERFIX program: scientific objectives, organization of the field operations and some main results obtained since the beginning of KERFIX program, as well as the results of the temporal evolution of hydrological, chemical and biological parameters.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Particles determine the residence time of many dissolved elements in seawater. Although a substantial number of field studies were conducted in the framework of major oceanographic programs as GEOSECS and JGOFS, knowledge about particle dynamics is still scarce. Moreover, the particulate trace metal behavior remains largely unknown. The GEOSECS sampling strategy during the 1970s focused on large sections across oceanic basins, where particles were collected by membrane filtration after Niskin bottle sampling, biasing the sampling toward the small particle pool. Late in this period, the first in situ pumps allowing large volume sampling were also developed. During the 1990s, JGOFS focused on the quantification of the “exported carbon flux” and its seasonal variability in representative biogeochemical provinces of the ocean, mostly using sediment trap deployments. Although scarce and discrete in time and space, these pioneering studies allowed an understanding of the basic fate of marine particles. This understanding improved considerably, especially when the analysis of oceanic tracers such as natural radionuclides allowed the first quantification of processes such as dissolved-particle exchange and particle settling velocities. Because the GEOTRACES program emphasizes the importance of collecting, characterizing and analyzing marine particles, this paper reflects our present understanding of the sources, fate and sinks of oceanic particles at the early stages of the program.},

  abstract = {Antibiotic administration is known to cause short-term disturbances in the microbiota of the human gastrointestinal tract, but the potential long-term consequences have not been well studied. The aims of this study were to analyse the long-term impact of a 7-day clindamycin treatment on the faecal microbiota and to simultaneously monitor the ecological stability of the microbiota in a control group as a baseline for reference. Faecal samples from four clindamycin-exposed and four control subjects were collected at nine different time points over 2 years. Using a polyphasic approach, we observed highly significant disturbances in the bacterial community that persisted throughout the sampling period. In particular, a sharp decline in the clonal diversity of Bacteroides isolates, as assessed by repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) and long-term persistence of highly resistant clones were found as a direct response to the antibiotic exposure. The Bacteroides community never returned to its original composition during the study period as assessed using the molecular fingerprinting technique, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). Furthermore, using real-time PCR we found a dramatic and persistent increase in levels of specific resistance genes in DNA extracted from the faeces after clindamycin administration. The temporal variations in the microbiota of the control group were minor compared to the large and persistent shift seen in the exposed group. These results demonstrate that long after the selection pressure from a short antibiotic exposure has been removed, there are still persistent long term impacts on the human intestinal microbiota that remain for up to 2 years post-treatment.},

  abstract = {Of marine eubacteria, the genus Vibrio is intriguing because member species are relevant to both marine ecology and human health. Many studies have touted the relationships of Vibrio to environmental factors, especially temperature and salinity, to predict total Vibrio abundance but lacked the taxonomic resolution to identify the relationships among species and the key drivers of Vibrio dynamics. To improve next-generation sequencing (NGS) surveys of Vibrio, we have conducted both 16S small subunit rRNA and heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) amplicon sequencing of water samples collected at two well-studied locations in the Neuse River Estuary, NC. Samples were collected between May and December 2016 with enhanced sampling efforts in response to two named storms. Using hsp60 sequences, 21 Vibrio species were identified, including the potential human pathogens V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus. Changes in the Vibrio community mirrored seasonal and storm-related changes in the water column, especially in response to an influx of nutrient-rich freshwater to the estuary after Hurricane Matthew, which initiated dramatic changes in the overall Vibrio community. Individual species dynamics were wide ranging, indicating that individual Vibrio taxa have unique ecologies and that total Vibrio abundance predictors are insufficient for risk assessments of potentially pathogenic species. Positive relationships between Vibrio, dinoflagellates, and Cyanobacteria were identified, as were intraspecies associations, which further illuminated the interactions of cooccurring Vibrio taxa along environmental gradients. IMPORTANCE The objectives of this research were to utilize a novel approach to improve sequence-based surveys of Vibrio communities and to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by presenting an analysis of Vibrio dynamics in the context of environmental conditions, with a particular focus on species that cause disease in humans and on storm effects. The methods presented here enabled the analysis of Vibrio dynamics with excellent taxonomic resolution and could be incorporated into future ecological studies and risk prediction strategies for potentially pathogenic species. Next-generation sequencing of hsp60 and other innovative sequence-based approaches are valuable tools and show great promise for studying Vibrio ecology and associated public health risks.},

To manipulate resource availability, {$<~$}5~µm treatments were incubated in dialysis bags submerged in the barrels filled with the unfiltered reservoir water amended with either orthophosphate or glucose or combination of both.

The members of a small subcluster of Betaproteobacteria (the R-BT065 probe) were mostly positively selected. The nutrient amendments differentially affected bacterioplankton dynamics in almost all treatments, and together with the size fractionation, altered HNF overall bacterivory as well as prey selection.

Concurrent high frequency BTM observations of meteorological, physical, and bio-optical variables are used to interpret processes contributing to the zooplankton variability. Zooplankton biomass estimates are derived from regressions of backscatter intensity data measured with an upward looking 153-kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and zooplankton net tow data collected near the BTM site as part of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS). Our data show clear event-scale variations. Peaks are associated with annual spring blooms involving mixed layer shoaling and in some cases passages of mesoscale eddy features. Biomass peaks are often coincident with maxima seen in BTM chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (inferred phytoplankton biomass). Some storm events do not appear to manifest in significant perturbations of zooplankton distributions; however, Hurricane Fabian (2003) greatly impacted these distributions. Estimates of zooplankton biomass and relative vertical velocity show the vertical structure of daily migration patterns. Seasonal variations in migration patterns are also evident, with diel changes in zooplankton biomass most pronounced in spring and least pronounced in winter. In summary, our high temporal resolution time series of estimated zooplankton biomass in the open ocean provide information on scales inaccessible through conventional monthly ship-based sampling. These data have implications for upper ocean ecology and the vertical transport of carbon and nitrogen through the diel migration of zooplankton.},

Microbial indicator titers associated with suspended particles and lake-bottom sediments were also investigated. Overall reduction rate constants for fecal coliform, E.coli, and enterococci in lake water and sediment were measured and reported. Attachment of microbial indicators to suspended matter and subsequent sedimentation appeared to be a significant fate mechanism. A slower reduction rate of indicator organisms in sediment further suggested that bottom sediment may act as a reservoir for prolonging indicator organism survival and added concern of recontamination of overlaying waters due to potential solids resuspension. Results indicated that enterococci might be a more stable indicator than E.coli and fecal coliform and, consequently, a more conservative indicator under brackish water conditions.},

In order to determine the robustness of our results, we employ three different variants of the ocean general circulation model (OGCM) required to transport and mix the nutrients and alkalinity into the upper ocean. In our standard model, the global export of CaCO3 is diagnosed as 1.1 PgC yr−1 (range of sensitivity cases 0.8 to 1.2 PgC yr−1) and that of opal as 180 Tmol Si yr−1 (range 160 to 180 Tmol Si yr−1). CaCO3 export is found to have three maxima at approximately 40°S, the equator, and around 40°N. In contrast, the opal export is dominated by the Southern Ocean with a single maximum at around 60°S. The molar export ratio of inorganic to organic carbon is diagnosed in our standard model to be about 0.09 (range 0.07 to 0.10) and found to be remarkably uniform spatially. The molar export ratio of opal to organic nitrogen varies substantially from values around 2 to 3 in the Southern Ocean south of 45°S to values below 0.5 throughout most of the rest of the ocean, except for the North Pacific. Irrespective of which OGCM is used, large phytoplankton dominate the export of POC, with diatoms alone accounting for 40\% of this export, while the contribution of coccolithophorids is only about 10\%. Small phytoplankton dominate net primary production (NPP) with a fraction of ∼70\%. Diatoms and coccolithophorids account for about 15\% and less than 2\% of NPP, respectively. These diagnosed contributions of the main phytoplankton functional groups to NPP are also robust across all OGCMs investigated. Correlation and regression analyses reveal that the variations in the relative contributions of diatoms and coccolithophorids to NPP can be predicted reasonably well on the basis of a few key parameters.},

In this study, we employed metagenomic shotgun sequencing to generate a microbial profile of the depositional environment associated with the sulfur-rich sediments of one such lake. Of the 1.5 M high-quality reads generated, 0.25 M were mapped to protein features, which in turn provide new insights into the metabolic function of this community. In particular, 45 diverse genes associated with sulfur metabolism were identified, the majority of which were linked to either the conversion of sulfate to adenylylsulfate and the subsequent production of sulfide from sulfite or the oxidation of sulfide, elemental sulfur, and thiosulfate via the sulfur oxidation (Sox) system. This is the first metagenomic study of an acidic, hypersaline depositional environment, and we present evidence for a surprisingly high level of microbial diversity. Our findings also illuminate the possibility that we may be meaningfully underestimating the effects of biology on the chemistry of these sulfur-rich sediments, thereby influencing our understanding of past geobiological conditions that may have been present on Earth as well as early Mars.},

  abstract = {Based on the transient exposure of Chesapeake Bay sediments to hydrocarbons and the metabolic versatility of known anaerobic alkane-degrading microorganisms, it was hypothesized that distinct Bay sediment communities, governed by geochemical gradients, would have intrinsic alkane-utilizing potential under sulfate-reducing and/or methanogenic conditions. Sediment cores were collected along a transect of the Bay. Community DNA was interrogated via pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes, PCR of anaerobic hydrocarbon activation genes, and qPCR of 16S rRNA genes and genes involved in sulfate reduction/methanogenesis. Site sediments were used to establish microcosms amended with n-hexadecane under sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes indicated that sediments associated with hypoxic water columns contained significantly greater proportions of Bacteria and Archaea consistent with syntrophic degradation of organic matter and methanogenesis compared to less reduced sediments. Microbial taxa frequently associated with hydrocarbon-degrading communities were found throughout the Bay, and the genetic potential for hydrocarbon metabolism was demonstrated via the detection of benzyl-(bssA) and alkylsuccinate synthase (assA) genes. Although microcosm studies did not indicate sulfidogenic alkane degradation, the data suggested that methanogenic conversion of alkanes was occurring. These findings highlight the potential role that anaerobic microorganisms could play in the bioremediation of hydrocarbons in the Bay.},

Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark–recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

  abstract = {Aggregates generated in water and wastewater treatment systems and those found in natural systems are fractal and therefore have different scaling properties than assumed in settling velocity calculations using Stokes' law. In order to demonstrate that settling velocity models based on impermeable spheres do not accurately relate aggregate size, porosity and settling velocity for highly porous fractal aggregates, we generated fractal aggregates by coagulation of latex microspheres in paddle mixers and analyzed each aggregate individually for its size, porosity, and settling velocity. Settling velocities of these aggregates were on average 4−8.3 times higher than those predicted using either an impermeable sphere model (Stokes' law) or a permeable sphere model that specified aggregate permeability for a homogeneous distribution of particles within an aggregate. Fractal dimensions (D) derived from size−porosity relationships for the three batches of aggregates were 1.78 ± 0.10, 2.19 ± 0.12 and 2.25 ± 0.10. These fractal dimensions were used to predict power law relationships between aggregate size and settling velocity based on Stokes' law. When it was assumed that the the drag coefficient, CD, was constant and fixed at its value of CD = 24/Re for the creeping flow region (Re ≪ 1), predicted slopes of size and settling velocity were in agreement with only the data sets where D {$>$} 2. As a result, when D {$<$} 2, aggregate porosities will be overestimated and fractal dimensions will be calculated incorrectly from settling velocity data and Stokes' law.},

  abstract = {Approximately 40 viruses are known from marine sponges; turbellarian and monogenetic flatworms; cephalopod, bivalve, and gastropod mollusks; nereid polychaetes; and isopod and decapod crustaceans. Most of the viruses can be tentatively assigned to the Herpesviridae, Baculoviridae, Iridoviridae, Adenoviridae, Papovaviridae, Reoviridae, “Birnaviridae”, Bunyaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Picornaviridae. Viruslike particles found in oysters might be representatives of the Togaviridae and Retroviridae. Enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses from crustaceans have developmental and morphological characteristics intermediate between families, and some show evidence of relationships to the Paramyxoviridae as well as the Bunyaviridae or Rhabdoviridae. Certain small viruses of shrimp cannot be assigned, even tentatively, to a particular family. Some viruses cause disease in wild and captive hosts, others are associated with disease states but may not be primary instigators, and many occur in apparently normal animals. The frequency of viral disease in natural populations of marine invertebrates is unknown. Several viruses that cause disease in captive animals, with or without experimental intervention, have also been found in diseased wild hosts, including herpeslike viruses of crabs and oysters, iridovirus of octopus, and reolike and bunyalike viruses of crabs. Iridolike viruses have been implicated in massive mortalities of cultured oysters. Baculoviruses, and IHHN virus, which is of uncertain affinities, cause economically damaging diseases in cultured penaeid shrimp. Double or multiple viral infection is common in crabs. For example, a reolike virus and associated rhabdolike virus act synergistically to cause paralytic and fatal disease inCallinectes sapidus. Information on host range, most susceptible stage, and viral latency is available only for viruses of shrimp. One baculovirus attacks five species of New World penaeid shrimp. IHHN virus infects three species ofPenaeus and causes catastrophic mortalities inP. stylirostris, but usually exhibits only inapparent infection inP. vannamei. Some shrimp viruses apparently are latent in larvae, causing disease only when shrimp have reached the postlarval or juvenile stages. Others are equally or more pathogenic in larvae. Studies of shrimp viruses and iridovirus-associated disease in cultured oysters point up the need for rapid and accurate diagnostic methods. Until appropriate cell cultures from marine invertebrates are devised, the viral identifications necessary for understanding of epizootiology, rapid containment of epizootics in cultured animals, and decisions regarding introductions of exotic species will be difficult or impossible.},

  abstract = {The increasing complexity of coupled hydrodynamic-ecosystem models may require skill assessment methods that both quantify various aspects of model performance and visually summarize these aspects within compact diagrams. Hence summary diagrams, such as the Taylor diagram [Taylor, 2001, Journal of Geophysical Research, 106, D7, 7183–7192], may meet this requirement by exploiting mathematical relationships between widely known statistical quantities in order to succinctly display a suite of model skill metrics in a single plot. In this paper, sensitivity results from a coupled model are compared with Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite ocean color data in order to assess the utility of the Taylor diagram and to develop a set of alternatives. Summary diagrams are only effective as skill assessment tools insofar as the statistical quantities they communicate adequately capture differentiable aspects of model performance. Here we demonstrate how the linear correlation coefficients and variance comparisons (pattern statistics) that constitute a Taylor diagram may fail to identify other potentially important aspects of coupled model performance, even if these quantities appear close to their ideal values. An additional skill assessment tool, the target diagram, is developed in order to provide summary information about how the pattern statistics and the bias (difference of mean values) each contribute to the magnitude of the total Root-Mean-Square Difference (RMSD). In addition, a potential inconsistency in the use of RMSD statistics as skill metrics for overall model and observation agreement is identified: underestimates of the observed field's variance are rewarded when the linear correlation scores are less than unity. An alternative skill score and skill score-based summary diagram is presented.},

Mean final course grades for all online and on-site students were compared statistically to see if there was a significant difference in learning. The findings revealed significant differences in online and on-site students' final grades, in favor of on-site student achievement. Statistical tests were also conducted on a number of subsets drawn from all students' final grades in order to search for any underlying nuances that might exist. When the first three semesters of data were removed from the dataset, no significant difference was found between the mean scores for on-site and online students for the seven most recent semesters. It is reasonable to conclude that it is possible for students in both on-site and online sections of a course to achieve equity in mathematics learning as measured by final course grades.},

  abstract = {Storm water runoff into the coastal ocean can have major impacts on a variety of oceanographic properties and processes that include coastal currents, coastal nutrient and optical characteristics, and contamination from heavy metals, organic compounds and microbial input. Off southern California these inputs are low for most of the year, bur during the winter season, large rainstorms result in large inputs of freshwater and the associated contaminants from storm water runoff. These inputs have both event and seasonal scale effects on Santa Monica Bay. Towyo and surface mapping were used to map the three-dimensional distribution of dissolved and particulate components associated with storm water runoff into Santa Monica Bay during the winter of 1996. Results from this study indicate that the plume can extend offshore approximately 5 km from the coast and alongshore at least 5 km. The freshwater generally forms a thin surface layer that is initially less than 5 m thick, although the influence of the plume (salinity {$<$} 33.0 pss) can be detected to nearly 10 m depth. Three major particle groups are observed during these periods: 1) particles within the storm water runoff, 2) phytoplankton in the water column, and 3) resuspended sediments. These particles have a large effect on the water column optics, and may carry a measurable load of absorbed contaminants including heavy metals and organic compounds which may be toxic to marine organisms. Following the plume over the course of 2-3 days at the end of a storm indicates that the plume remains in the coastal area for at least 3 days with gradual dilution during this period. Dinoflagellate blooms can develop after the rain event providing a secondary particulate field associated with the plume. It is likely that the stratification and nutrient input provided by the freshwater inflow contribute to the presence and development of this dinoflagellate population.},

  abstract = {The dispersion of effluent from coastal ocean sewage outfalls has continued to be a difficult problem to study in situ. The spatial extent of the detectable effluent field is an important question for understanding the range of potential impacts from the effluent plume. Sampling around large southern California sewage outfalls is done using automated water column profilers (i.e., CTDs) at designated stations, typically centered on the outfall. Discrete water samples, if taken, are collected at predefined depths. While this method of sampling allows for analysis of the environmental impacts to the receiving water from these outfalls, the data have shown that the studies are inadequate for determining the vertical and horizontal spatial extents of these subsurface wastewater fields. To address this issue, the Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD), California supplemented its normal receiving water sampling by using a Guildline Minibat towed underwater vehicle, equipped with a CTD and in situ pumping system, to map the distribution of physical, bio-optical, chemical, and bacterial variables in the vicinity of its outfall. A pumping system enabled the measurement of nitrate, ammonium and selected indicator bacteria simultaneously with the in situ physical and bio-optical CTD measurements providing more unambiguous mapping of the effluent plume over an extended area. Telemetered current and temperature observations were used for adaptive placement of the sampling transects to optimally sample the plume. We compare results from a late winter, weakly stratified period when the flow was weakly upcoast with a strongly stratified summer period when the currents were strongly downcoast. The mapping demonstrates that the plume is clearly present for distances of at least 12.5 kin in either direction from the outfall, depending on the current direction. The mapping results allow comparison with results from traditional receiving water monitoring and plume models of initial height, dilution, and thickness.},

Attempts to reduce this phenomenon of underperformance through increasing classroom structure via active learning have been partially successful. In this study, we address the hypothesis that the achievement gap between white and URM students in an undergraduate biology course has a psychological and emotional component arising from stereotype threat. Specifically, we introduced a values affirmation exercise that counters stereotype threat by reinforcing a student's feelings of integrity and self-worth in three iterations of an intensive active-learning college biology course. On average, this exercise reduced the achievement gap between URM and white students who entered the course with the same incoming grade point average. This result suggests that achievement gaps resulting from the underperformance of URM students could be mitigated by providing students with a learning environment that removes psychological and emotional impediments of performance through short psychosocial interventions.},

  abstract = {The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled investigations of the gut microbiome with unprecedented resolution and throughput. This has stimulated the development of sophisticated bioinformatics tools to analyze the massive amounts of data generated. Researchers therefore need a clear understanding of the key concepts required for the design, execution and interpretation of NGS experiments on microbiomes. We conducted a literature review and used our own data to determine which approaches work best. The two main approaches for analyzing the microbiome, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicons and shotgun metagenomics, are illustrated with analyses of libraries designed to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Several methods for taxonomic classification of bacterial sequences are discussed. We present simulations to assess the number of sequences that are required to perform reliable appraisals of bacterial community structure. To the extent that fluctuations in the diversity of gut bacterial populations correlate with health and disease, we emphasize various techniques for the analysis of bacterial communities within samples (α-diversity) and between samples (β-diversity). Finally, we demonstrate techniques to infer the metabolic capabilities of a bacteria community from these 16S and shotgun data.},

  abstract = {After the great Mississippi River flood of 1993, the hypoxic (or low-oxygen) "dead zone" in the Gulf of Mexico more than doubled its size, reaching an all-time high of over 7,700 square miles in July of 1999. Scientists attribute the Gulf of Mexico dead zone largely to nutrient runoff from agriculture in the Mississippi River basin. During the warm months, these nutrients fuel eutrophication, or high organic production, causing large algal blooms. When the algae decay, the result is hypoxia. Reports of such hypoxic events around the world have been increasing since the mid 1960s. Eutrophication and hypoxia have resulted in mortality of bottom-dwelling life in dozens of marine ecosystems and have stressed fisheries worldwide. Some algal blooms can alter the function of coastal ecosystems or, potentially, threaten human health. Anthropogenic nutrient loading from sources such as agriculture, fossil fuel emissions, and climate events is believed to be related to the global increase in frequency, size, and duration of certain algal blooms.},

  abstract = {This completely rewritten classic text features many new examples, insights and topics including mediational, categorical, and multilevel models. Substantially reorganized, this edition provides a briefer, more streamlined examination of data analysis. Noted for its model-comparison approach and unified framework based on the general linear model, the book provides readers with a greater understanding of a variety of statistical procedures. This consistent framework, including consistent vocabulary and notation, is used throughout to develop fewer but more powerful model building techniques. The authors show how all analysis of variance and multiple regression can be accomplished within this framework. The model-comparison approach provides several benefits:  It strengthens the intuitive understanding of the material thereby increasing the~ability to successfully analyze data in the future It provides more control in the analysis of data so that readers can apply the techniques to a broader spectrum of questions It reduces the number of statistical techniques that must be memorized It teaches readers how to become data analysts instead of statisticians. The book opens with an overview of data analysis. All the necessary concepts for statistical inference used throughout the book are introduced in Chapters 2 through 4. The remainder of the book builds on these models. Chapters 5 - 7 focus on regression analysis, followed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), mediational analyses, non-independent or correlated errors, including multilevel modeling, and outliers and error violations. The book is appreciated by all for its detailed treatment of ANOVA, multiple regression, nonindependent observations, interactive and nonlinear models of data, and its guidance for treating outliers and other problematic aspects of data analysis. Intended for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses on data analysis, statistics, and/or quantitative methods taught in psychology, education, or other behavioral and social science departments, this book also appeals to researchers who analyze data. A protected website featuring additional examples and problems with data sets, lecture notes, PowerPoint presentations, and class-tested exam questions is available to adopters. This material uses SAS but can easily be adapted to other programs. A working knowledge of basic algebra and any multiple regression program is assumed.},

  abstract = {We analyzed changes in bacterioplankton morphology and composition during enhanced protozoan grazing by image analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization with group-specific rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. Enclosure experiments were conducted in a small, fishless freshwater pond which was dominated by the cladoceran Daphnia magna. The removal of metazooplankton enhanced protozoan grazing pressure and triggered a microbial succession from fast-growing small bacteria to larger grazing-resistant morphotype. These were mainly different types of filamentous bacteria which correlated in biomass with the population development of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF). Small bacterial rods and cocci, which showed increased proportion after removal of Daphnia and doubling times of 6 to 11 h, belonged nearly exclusively to the beta subdivision of the class Proteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster. The majority of this newly produced bacterial biomass was rapidly consumed by HNF. In contrast, the proportion of bacteria belonging to the gamma and alpha subdivisions of the Proteobacteria increased throughout the experiment. The alpha subdivision consisted mainly of rods that were 3 to 6 mu m in length, which probably exceeded the size range of bacteria edible by protozoa. Initially, these organisms accounted for less than 1\% of total bacteria, but after 72 h they became the predominant group of the bacterial assemblage. Other types of grazing-resistant, filamentous bacteria were also found within the beta subdivision of Proteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster. We conclude that the predation regimen is a major structuring force for the bacterial community composition in this system. Protozoan grazing resulted in shifts of the morphological as well as the taxonomic composition of the bacterial assemblage. Grazing-resistant filamentous bacteria can develop within different phylogenetic groups of bacteria, and formerly underepresented taxa might become a dominant group when protozoan predation is the major selective pressure.},

  abstract = {The paradigm of the 'microbial loop' has became increasingly important for understanding the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. Most of the microbial loop studies have focused on energy flow and nutrient cycling. Much less is known, however, about the importance of grazing as a force shaping the structure and community composition of planktonic bacteria. Theoretical considerations of predator-prey interactions suggest that predator evasion mechanisms should have evolved for bacteria in the same way as in other predator-prey systems (e.g. zooplankton-phytoplankton). Consistent with this hypothesis, field data show that bacteria are often the most stable component of planktonic communities. Refuges from grazing are one of the possible mechanisms buffering bacterioplankton against strong seasonal fluctuations in abundance. Substantial direct and indirect evidence exists for the occurrence of grazing-resistant bacteria (GRB) in both marine and freshwater habitats. We summarize the potential mechanisms for grazing resistance, including morphological, chemical and behavioral defenses as well as growth in spatial refuges. Cell size appears to be an important factor influencing susceptibility to grazing, with a refuge at the lower and upper ends of the bacterial size range. Thus, a relative grazing resistance can be assumed for the large number of ultramicrobacteria as well as for morphologically complex growth forms such as filaments and aggregates. Besides morphological features, resistance may be achieved by other mechanisms for which, however, much less information is available. We describe how GRB can be included in conceptual models of the interactions among metazooplankton, bacterivorous protozoans and bacteria. It is suggested that the relative importance of GRB increases with increasing grazing pressure exerted by protozoans, whereas it decreases with increasing top-down control of protozoans by metazooplankton. GRB may reduce the productivity of planktonic systems through decreased trophic transfer efficiencies and reduced regeneration of bacterially bound nutrients.},

  abstract = {Predation is a major mortality factor of planktonic bacteria and an important shaping force for the phenotypic and taxonomic structure of bacterial communities. In this paper we: (1) summarise current knowledge on bacterial phenotypic properties which affect their vulnerability towards grazers, and (2) review experimental evidence demonstrating that this phenotypic heterogeneity results in shifts of bacterial community composition during enhanced protist grazing pressure. Size-structured interactions are especially important in planktonic systems and bacterial cell size influences the mortality rate and the type of grazer to which bacteria are most susceptible. When protists are the major bacterivores, both very small and large bacterial cells gain some size refuge. Recent studies have revealed that also various non-morphological traits such as motility, physicochemical surface characters and toxicity affect bacterial vulnerability and protist feeding success. These properties are effective at different stages during the feeding process of interception feeding flagellates (encounter, capture, ingestion, digestion). Grazing-resistant bacteria in natural communities can account for a substantial portion of the total bacterial biomass at least in more productive aquatic systems. In field and laboratory experiments it has been demonstrated that increased protozoan grazing results in shifts in the phenotypic and genotypic composition of the bacterial assemblage. The importance of this shaping force for the bacterial community structure depends, however, on the overall food web structure, especially on the composition of the metazooplankton. Whereas the structuring impact of bacterial grazers is well documented, relatively little is known about how grazing-mediated changes in bacterial communities influence microbially mediated processes and biogeochemically important transformations.},

The research vessel was kept at a fixed position so that individual jellyfish remained in the acoustic beam for prolonged periods in the low advective environment of the deep fjord basin. The population of jellyfish was divided into different vertical modes with different migration behavior. A scattering layer (SL) of P. periphylla was located at 150-200 m during the day; it migrated coherently to the upper 50 m at night and returned to depth the next morning. A deeper SL seemed to remain below 250 m both day and night. However, focus on individuals revealed additional, asynchronous migration activity. A pulse of P. periphylla left upper layers already a few hours after sunset, and there was interchange of individuals between shallow and deep water throughout the night, including ascent of individuals from the apparent nonmigrating deepest SL. Vertical migration velocities were 2 cm s−1 both during ascent and descent, irrespective of time.

Critical thinking has been an essential outcome of nursing students to prepare them to provide effective and safe quality care for patients. Think-Pair-Share is a cooperative discussion strategy that provides students with adequate time to think in order to increase their quality of responses. Students become actively involved in thinking about the concepts presented in their discussion. Ninety one students participated in this study. Forty six (50\%) of the participants were included in the control group (Non-TPS) and 45 (50\%) were included in the experimental group (TPS). The participants were sophomore-level generic accelerated baccalaureate nursing students enrolled in the same Health Assessment nursing course. The HESI critical thinking test was the tool used before (Pretest) and after (posttest) the course to collect data about student's CT skills. The study used a quasi experimental design. The independent sample t test and Mann-Whitney test were used to analyze the data. Findings revealed a significant increase in CT over time, throughout the 17-week course, with the use of TPS teaching/learning strategy. The results suggest that TPS is an effective strategy to foster CT of nursing students and could be used by educators to foster learners' CT in their courses. The study has significant implications on education, nursing practice, and research.},

  abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones are major sites of fixed nitrogen loss in the ocean. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation, anammox, in pelagic nitrogen removal. Sources of ammonium for the anammox reaction, however, remain controversial, as heterotrophic denitrification and alternative anaerobic pathways of organic matter remineralization cannot account for the ammonium requirements of reported anammox rates. Here, we explore the significance of microaerobic respiration as a source of ammonium during organic matter degradation in the oxygen-deficient waters off Namibia and Peru. Experiments with additions of double-labelled oxygen revealed high aerobic activity in the upper OMZs, likely controlled by surface organic matter export. Consistently observed oxygen consumption in samples retrieved throughout the lower OMZs hints at efficient exploitation of vertically and laterally advected, oxygenated waters in this zone by aerobic microorganisms. In accordance, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses identified genes encoding for aerobic terminal oxidases and demonstrated their expression by diverse microbial communities, even in virtually anoxic waters. Our results suggest that microaerobic respiration is a major mode of organic matter remineralization and source of ammonium (\textasciitilde 45-100\%) in the upper oxygen minimum zones, and reconcile hitherto observed mismatches between ammonium producing and consuming processes therein.},

Chesapeake Bay bacterioplankton exhibited a repeatable annual pattern and strong seasonal shifts. In winter, the bacterial communities were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, whereas in summer, the predominant bacteria were members of Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes. Phylotypes of Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria present in warm seasons were different from those in cold seasons. Relatively stable communities were present in summer–fall across the sampling years, whereas winter communities were highly variable interannually. Temporal variations in bacterial communities were best explained by changes of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and water temperature, but dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate, and viral abundance also contributed significantly to the bacterial seasonal variations.},

The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States, but despite its ecological and economic significance, little is known about its microbial community composition. A rapid screening approach, ITS (internal transcribed spacer)-LH (length heterogeneity)-PCR, was used to screen six rRNA operon (16S rRNA-ITS-23S rRNA) clone libraries constructed from bacterioplankton collected in three distinct regions of the Chesapeake Bay over two seasons. The natural length variation of the 16S-23S rRNA gene ITS region, as well as the presence and location of tRNA-alanine coding regions within the ITS, was determined for 576 clones. Clones representing unique ITS-LH-PCR sizes were sequenced and identified. Dramatic shifts in bacterial composition (changes within subgroups or clades) were observed for the Alphaproteobacteria (Roseobacter clade, SAR11), Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus), and Actinobacteria, suggesting strong seasonal variation within these taxonomic groups. Despite large gradients in salinity and phytoplankton parameters, a remarkably homogeneous bacterioplankton community was observed in the bay in each season. Stronger seasonal, rather than spatial, variation of the bacterioplankton population was also supported by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and LH-PCR analyses, indicating that environmental parameters with stronger seasonal, rather than regional, dynamics, such as temperature, might determine bacterioplankton community composition in the Chesapeake Bay.},

Although the presence of pathogenicity islands is a prerequisite for many bacterial diseases, little is known about their origins or mechanism of transfer into the bacterium. The bacterial agent of epidemic cholera, Vibrio cholerae , contains a bacteriophage known as cholera-toxin phage (CTXφ)4, which encodes the cholera toxin, and a large pathogenicity island called the VPI (for V. cholerae pathogenicity island)5 which itself encodes a toxin-coregulated pilus that functions as a colonization factor6 and as a CTXφ receptor4. We have now identified the VPI pathogenicity island as the genome of another filamentous bacteriophage, VPIφ. We show that VPIφ is transferred between  V. cholerae strains and provide evidence that the TcpA subunit of the toxin-coregulated type IV pilus is in fact a coat protein of VPIφ. Our results are the first description of a phage that encodes a receptor for another phage and of a virus–virus interaction that is necessary for bacterial pathogenicity.},

While investigating the relationship between pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains, we identified a chromosomal pathogenicity island (PAI) that is present in epidemic and pandemic strains but absent from nonpathogenic strains. Initially, two ToxR-regulated genes (aldA and tagA) were studied and were found to be associated with epidemic and pandemic strains but absent in nontoxigenic strains. The region containing aldA and tagA comprises 13 kb of previously unidentified DNA and is part of a PAI that contains a regulator of virulence genes (ToxT) and a gene cluster encoding an essential colonization factor and the cholera toxin phage receptor (toxin-coregulated pilus; TCP). The PAI is 39.5 kb in size, has low \%G+C (35\%), contains putative integrase and transposase genes, is flanked by att sites, and inserts near a 10Sa RNA gene (ssrA), suggesting it may be of bacteriophage origin. We found this PAI in two clinical non-O1/non-O139 cholera toxin-positive strains, suggesting that it can be transferred within V. cholerae. The sequence within this PAI includes an ORF with homology to a gene associated with the type IV pilus gene cluster of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, a transposase from Vibrio anguillarum, and several ORFs with no known homology. As the PAI contains the CTXΦ receptor, it may represent the initial genetic factor required for the emergence of epidemic and pandemic cholera. We propose to call this island VPI (V. cholerae pathogenicity island).},

  abstract = {The surface water of the marine environment has traditionally been viewed as a nitrogen (N) limited habitat, and this has guided the development of conceptual biogeochemical models focusing largely on the reservoir of nitrate as the critical source of N to sustain primary productivity. However, selected groups of Bacteria, including cyanobacteria, and Archaea can utilize dinitrogen (N-2) as an alternative N source. In the marine environment, these microorganisms can have profound effects on net community production processes and can impact the coupling of C-N-P cycles as well as the net oceanic sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. As one component of an integrated `Nitrogen Transport and Transformations' project, we have begun to re-assess our understanding of (1) the biotic sources and rates of N-2 fixation in the world's oceans, (2) the major controls on rates of oceanic N-2 fixation, (3) the significance of this N-2 fixation for the global carbon cycle and (4) the role of human activities in the alteration of oceanic N-2 fixation. Preliminary results indicate that rates of N-2 fixation, especially in subtropical and tropical open ocean habitats, have a major role in the global marine N budget. Iron (Fe) bioavailability appears to be an important control and is, therefore, critical in extrapolation to global rates of N-2 fixation. Anthropogenic perturbations may alter N-2 fixation in coastal environments through habitat destruction and eutrophication, and open ocean N-2 fixation may be enhanced by warming and increased stratification of the upper water column. Global anthropogenic and climatic changes may also affect N-2 fixation rates, for example by altering dust inputs (i.e. Fe) or by expansion of subtropical boundaries. Some recent estimates of global ocean N-2 fixation are in the range of 100-200 Tg N (1-2 x 10(14) g N) yr(-1), but have large uncertainties. These estimates are nearly an order of magnitude greater than historical, pre-1980 estimates, but approach modern estimates of oceanic denitrification.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}br/{$>$}Oceanic productivity, fishery yields and the net marine sequestration of atmospheric greenhouse gases are all controlled by the structure and function of planktonic communities. Detailed paleoceanographic studies have documented abrupt changes in these processes over timescales ranging from centuries to millennia. Most of these major shifts in oceanic productivity and biodiversity are attributable to changes in Earth's climate, manifested through large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions. By comparison, contemporary biodiversity and plankton community dynamics are generally considered to be "static", in part due to the lack of a suitable time frame of reference, and the absence of oceanic data to document ecosystem change over relatively short timescales (decades to centuries). Here we show that the average concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl a) and the estimated rates of primary production in the surface waters of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) off Hawaii have more than doubled while the concentrations of dissolved silicate and phosphate have decreased during the past three decades. These changes are accompanied by an increase in the concentration of chl b, suggesting a shift in phytoplankton community structure. We hypothesize that these observed ecosystem trends and other related biogeochemical processes in the upper portion of the NPSG are manifestations of plankton community succession in response to climate variations. The hypothesized photosynthetic population "domain shift" toward an ecosystem dominated by prokaryotes has altered nutrient flux pathways and affected food web structure, new and export production processes, and fishery yields. Further stratification of the surface ocean resulting from global warming could lead to even more enhanced selection pressures and additional changes in biogeochemical dynamics.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

After a decade of ecosystem surveillance, this sentinel observatory has produced an unprecedented data set and some new views of an old ocean.

ALOHA, 22°45′N, 158°W) with measurements collected at approximately monthly intervals has revealed significant variability in both ecosystem processes. Depth-integrated (0–200 m) primary production averaged 463 mg C m−2 day−1 (s = 156, n = 54) or 14.1 mol C m−2 year−1. This mean value is greater than estimates for the North Pacific Ocean gyre made prior to 1984, but conforms to data obtained since the advent of trace metal-clean techniques. Daily rates of primary productivity at Sta. ALOHA exhibited interannual variability including a nearly 3-year sustained increase during the period 1990–1992 that coincided with a prolonged El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. Export production, defined as the particulate carbon (PC) flux measured at the 150 m reference depth, also varied considerably during the initial 5 years of the ongoing field experiment. The PC flux averaged 29 mg C m−2 day−1 (s = 11, n = 43) or 0.88 mol Cm−2 year−1. A 5-fold variation between the minimum and maximum fluxes, measured in any given year, was observed. During the first 3 years of this program (1989–1991), a pattern was resolved that included two major export events per annum one centered in late winter and the other in late summer. After 1991, export production exhibited a systematic decrease with time during the prolonged ENSO event. When expressed as a percentage of the contemporaneous primary production, PC export ranged from 2 to 16.9\%, with a 5-year mean of 6.7\% (s = 3.3, n = 40). Contrary to existing empirical models, contemporaneous primary production and PC flux were poorly correlated, and during the ENSO period they exhibited a significant inverse correlation. This unexpected decoupling of particle production and flux has numerous implications for oceanic biogeochemical cycles and for the response of the ocean to environmental perturbations.},

  abstract = {Extensive genomic diversity within coexisting members of a microbial species has been revealed through selected cultured isolates and metagenomic assemblies. Yet, the cell-by-cell genomic composition of wild uncultured populations of co-occurring cells is largely unknown. In this work, we applied large-scale single-cell genomics to study populations of the globally abundant marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus. We show that they are composed of hundreds of subpopulations with distinct “genomic backbones,” each backbone consisting of a different set of core gene alleles linked to a small distinctive set of flexible genes. These subpopulations are estimated to have diverged at least a few million years ago, suggesting ancient, stable niche partitioning. Such a large set of coexisting subpopulations may be a general feature of free-living bacterial species with huge populations in highly mixed habitats. Cyanobacterial Diversity What does it mean to be a global species? The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is ubiquitous and, arguably, the most abundant and productive of all living organisms. Although to our eyes the seas look uniform, to a bacterium the ocean's bulk is a plethora of microhabitats, and by large-scale single-cell genomic analysis of uncultured cells, Kashtan et al. (p. 416; see the Perspective by Bowler and Scanlan) reveal that Prochlorococcus has diversified to match. This “species” constitutes a mass of subpopulations—each with million-year ancestry—that vary seasonally in abundance. The subpopulations in turn have clades nested within that show covariation between sets of core alleles and variable gene content, indicating flexibility of responses to rapid environmental changes. Large sets of coexisting populations could be a general feature of other free-living bacterial species living in highly mixed habitats.},

  abstract = {Along with outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, the problem of biomedical wastewater disposal has caused widespread public concern, as reportedly the presence is confirmed in wastewater. Keeping in mind (i) available evidence indicating need to better understand potential of wastewater mediated transmission and (ii) knowledge gaps in its occurrence, viability, persistence, and inactivation in wastewater, in this present work, we wanted to re-emphasize some strategies for management of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated wastewater to minimise any possible secondary transmission to human and environment. The immediate challenges to consider while considering wastewater management are uncertainty about this new biothreat, relying on prediction based treatments options, significant population being the latent asymptomatic carrier increased risk of passing out of the virus to sewage network, inadequacy of wastewater treatment facility particularly in populated developing countries and increased generation of wastewater due to increased cleanliness concern. In absence of regulated central treatment facility, installation of decentralized wastewater treatment units with single or multiple disinfection barriers in medical units, quarantine centre, isolation wards, testing facilities seems to be urgent for minimizing any potential risk of wastewater transmission. Employing some emerging disinfectants (peracetic acid, performic acid, sodium dichloro isocyanurate, chloramines, chlorine dioxide, benzalconium chloride) shows prospects in terms of virucidal properties. However, there is need of additional research on coronaviruses specific disinfection data generation, regular monitoring of performance considering all factors influencing virus survival, performance evaluation in actual water treatment, need of augmenting disinfection dosages, environmental considerations to select the most appropriate disinfection technology.},

  abstract = {Free-drifting sediment net traps were deployed 14 times at depths between 80 and 500-m for 1-3 days each during the late monsoon-intermonsoon transition in the central Arabian Sea. Two locations (19.5 and 15.5°-N) were within the permanently oxygen-deficient zone (ODZ), and a third (11°-N) had a shallow and thin oxygen minimum. The secondary nitrite maximum, which serves as a tracer of the ODZ, thinned from 250-m thick at stations 19.5 and 15.5°-N to 50-m thick at station 11°-N. Overall, organic carbon fluxes ranged from 13.2-g-m\textsuperscript{2}-yr\textsuperscript{-1} at 80-m to a minimum of 1.1-g-m\textsuperscript{2}-yr\textsuperscript{-1} at 500-m. Fluxes at the more oxygenated 11°-N station attenuate faster than within the permanent ODZ. Martin curve attenuation coefficients for 19.5 and 15.5°-N are respectively 0.59 and 0.63 and for 11°-N it is 0.98. At least six potential mechanisms might explain why particles sinking through the ODZ are more effectively transferred to depth: (M1) oxygen effects, (M2) microbial loop efficiencies and chemoautotrophy, (M3) changes in zooplankton dynamics, (M4) additions of ballast that might sorb and protect organic matter from decay (M4a) or change sinking speeds (M4b), (M5) inputs of refractory organic matter and (M6) temperature effects. These mechanisms are intertwined, and they were explored using a combination of mineral (XPS) and organic matter characterizations of the sinking material, shipboard incubation experiments, and evaluations of existing literature. Direct evidence was found supporting an oxygen effect and/or changes in the efficiency of the microbial loop including the addition of chemoautotrophic carbon to the sinking flux in the upper 500-m. Less direct evidence was found for the other potential mechanisms. A simple conceptual model consistent with our and other recent data suggests that the upper ODZ microbial community determines the initial flux attenuation, and that zooplankton and sinking speed become more important deeper in the water column. The exact interplay between the various mechanisms remains to be further evaluated.},

To learn more about POM-associated microbial communities in cold waters, we worked aboard the icebreaker 'Kapitan Dranitsyn' during the Nansen and Amundsen Basins Observational System (NABOS) 2005 cruise to the Laptev Sea, a river-impacted region in the Siberian Arctic, to sample 3 size fractions of particles operationally defined as sinking aggregates ({$>$} 60 mu m), smaller suspended particles (1 to 60 mu m), and free-living bacteria (0.22 to 1 mu m). Sample temperatures and depths ranged from -1.6 to 1.5 degrees C and 25 to 150 m, respectively. Analysis of associated microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene-based clone libraries and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) indicated greatest diversity and richness in the smaller size fractions and significantly different communities in the aggregate fraction for both Bacteria and Archaea. The most abundant clones in the bacterial libraries were Gammaproteobacteria, followed by members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) group and Alphaproteobacteria; the archaeal libraries contained primarily Marine Group I Crenarchaeota. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that bacterial communities, especially those associated with aggregates, were influenced by riverine input and temperature. Determinants of archaeal communities were less clear, but temperature appeared important. Distinctions in bacterial and archaeal community complexity observed among the different particle size classes suggest the importance of particle residence time in structuring associated microbial communities and defining their biogeochemical roles.},

Fluxes of O2, NH4+, NO2+3 and SRP at the restored site were enhanced by at least~one order of magnitude during all seasons. Seasonal denitrification rates at the restored site, measured as flux of N2-N, ranged from 0.3 to 1.6~mmol N2-N m-2 h-1, with August rates among the highest ever recorded for an aquatic system. In addition to oysters (131 oysters m-2; average shell height = 114 mm; age = 2 to 7 yr), the restored reef provided habitat for 24585 other macrobenthic organisms per square meter compared to 2265 organisms m-2 at the control site. Restoration enhanced the average standing stock of assimilated nutrients by 95 g N m-2 and 15 g P m-2. Nitrogen and phosphorus in shells of live oysters and mussels accounted for 47 and 48\% of total nitrogen and phosphorus standing stocks, respectively. Our results demonstrate that oyster reef restoration can significantly increase denitrification rates and enhance nutrient sequestration via assimilation into bivalve shells.},

Review of studies evaluating the effects of C.~virginica on nitrogen (N) cycling found that oysters can have effects on water quality that vary by orders of magnitude among sites, seasons, and growing condition (e.g., oyster reefs, aquaculture). Nitrogen contained in phytoplankton consumed by oysters may be returned to the water column, assimilated into oyster tissue and shell, buried in the sediments, or returned to the atmosphere as dinitrogen gas, primarily via denitrification. Accurately quantifying oyster-related N removal requires detailed knowledge of these primary fates of N in coastal waters. A review of existing data demonstrated that the current state of knowledge is incomplete in many respects. Nitrogen assimilated into oyster tissue and shell per gram of dry weight was generally similar across sites and in oysters growing on reefs compared to aquaculture. Data on long-term burial of N associated with oyster reefs or aquaculture are lacking. When compared to suitable reference sites, denitrification rates were not consistently enhanced. Depending on environmental and oyster growing conditions, changes in denitrification rates varied by orders of magnitude among studies and did not always occur. Oyster aquaculture rarely enhanced denitrification. Unharvested oyster reefs frequently enhanced denitrification rates. Incorporating oysters into nutrient reduction strategies will require filling gaps in existing data to determine the extent to which relationships between N removal and environmental and/or growing conditions can be generalized.},

Analyses of dated sediment cores reveal initial evidence of organic enrichment in \textasciitilde 200 yr old strata, while signs of increased phytoplankton and decreased water clarity first appeared \textasciitilde 100 yr ago. Severe, recurring deep-water hypoxia and loss of diverse submersed vascular plants were first evident in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. The degradation of these benthic habitats has contributed to declines in benthic macroinfauna in deep mesohaline regions of the Bay and blue crabs in shallow polyhaline areas. In contrast, copepods, which are heavily consumed in pelagic food chains, are relatively unaffected by nutrient-induced changes in phytoplankton. Intense mortality associated with fisheries and disease have caused a dramatic decline in eastern oyster stocks and associated Bay water filtration, which may have exacerbated eutrophication effects on phytoplankton and water clarity. Extensive tidal marshes, which have served as effective nutrient buffers along the Bay margins, are now being lost with rising sea level. Although the Bay’s overall fisheries production has probably not been affected by eutrophication, decreases in the relative contribution of demersal fish and in the efficiency with which primary production is transferred to harvest suggest fundamental shifts in trophic and habitat structures. Bay ecosystem responses to changes in nutrient loading are complicated by non-linear feedback mechanisms, including particle trapping and binding by benthic plants that increase water clarity, and by oxygen effects on benthic nutrient recycling efficiency. Observations in Bay tributaries undergoing recent reductions in nutrient input indicate relatively rapid recovery of some ecosystem functions but lags in the response of others.},

  abstract = {Seasonal O2 budgets were developed for the mesohaline region of Chesapeake Bay (USA),which experiences bottom water O 2depletion in summer. Rates of O2production and consumption by the planktonic community and O2 consumption by the benthos were measured at 1 to 4 wk intervals from March to October at 2 stations. Under summer anoxic conditions, rates of sulfide diffusion from sediments were also measured directly with in situ chambers. Weekly observations of water column temperature, salinity and 02c,ombined with wind data and regression models, allowed calculation of air-sea gas exchange. Using these rates in mass-balance analyses for the upper and lower water column layers, we were able to compute net physical O2 transport across the pycnocline and longitudinally through the bottom layer. Mean monthly estimates of these net physical O2 transports were highly correlated to their respective O2 gradients. Slopes of these correlations provided estimates of the average spring-summer vertical dispersion coefficient (0.2 cm2 S-') and net gravitational water velocity (5 cm S-'), both of which correspond to previous reports. Vertically integrated planktonic respiration rates in the lower water column layer were compared to benthic O2consumption from April to August. In general, planktonic processes dominated 0 2 consun\textasciitilde ptionc,omprising almost two-thirds of the total. Oxygen consumption associated with benthic processes, however, exceeded planktonic rates in early spring prior to vernal warming and in late August when large S2-fluxes resulted from release of accumulated pore water pools. By combining our respiration data with values from other coastal environments and plotting rates versus water-column depth, we find a general relation in which planktonic respiration exceeds benthic respiration for systems deeper than 5 m. Hence, for stratifled estuaries with bottom layers thicker than 5 m, seasonal O2 depletion is dnven primarily by planktonic respiration rather than benthic consumption of accumulated organic pools. A comparison of mean monthly rates for bottom respiration (plankton plus benthos) and net physical O2 replenishment here revealed that the 2 processes were highly correlated between March and October; both rates increased through July and declined thereafter. This strong correlation underscores a fundamental interdependence of biological O2 consumption and net physical transport, w h \textasciitilde{} c his based on the O2 gradient by which the 2 processes are coupled. Consequently, relatively large reductions In respiratory O2 consumption (e.g.with decreased organic inputs) would lead to substantially smaller decreases in the extent of bottom water O2depletion because of a n inherent adjustment between the coupled biological and physical processes.},

This objective is achieved by reducing the dimensionality of variable space to an efficient, low-dimensional summative model of the underlying data structure that reflects the coordinated response of species to environmental factors. While multivariate methods have proven indispensable for analyzing both experimental and survey data in the biological sciences, considerable confusion persists regarding the selection of appropriate analytical strategies. The selection of an appropriate analytical strategy, which includes important decisions regarding data transformation, variable standardization and methodological approach, should be based on fundamental considerations of statistical appropriateness, data structure, and study objectives. Unfortunately, past and more recent assessments of multivariate analytical strategies have been based largely on empirical models of questionable relevance. This empirical approach has led to misleading recommendations and erroneous generalizations regarding the relative efficacy of the available multivariate methods. This paper dispels these misleading recommendations and provides some general guidelines for selecting appropriate data transformations, variable standardizations and methodological approaches in the multivariate analysis of biological data.},

  abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are characterized by relatively deep, plankton-based estuaries and much shallower systems where light reaches the bottom. These latter systems, including lagoons, bar-built estuaries, the fringing regions of deeper systems, and other systems of only a few meters deep, are characterized by a variety of benthic primary producers that augment and, in many cases, dominate the production supplied by phytoplankton. These “shallow coastal photic systems” are subject to a wide variety of both natural and anthropogenic drivers and possess numerous natural “filters” that modulate their response to these drivers; in many cases, the responses are much different from those in deeper estuaries. Natural drivers include meteorological forcing, freshwater inflow, episodic events such as storms, wet/dry periods, and background loading of optically active constituents. Anthropogenic drivers include accelerated inputs of nutrients and sediments, chemical contaminants, physical alteration and hydrodynamic manipulation, climate change, the presence of intensive aquaculture, fishery harvests, and introduction of exotic species. The response of these systems is modulated by a number of factors, notably bathymetry, physical flushing, fetch, sediment type, background light attenuation, and the presence of benthic autotrophs, suspension feeding bivalves, and fringing tidal wetlands. Finally, responses to stressors in these systems, particularly anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, consist of blooms of phytoplankton, macroalgae, and epiphytic algae, including harmful algal blooms, subsequent declines in submerged aquatic vegetation and loss of critical habitat, development of hypoxia/anoxia particularly on short time scales (i.e., “diel-cycling”), fish kills, and loss of secondary production. This special issue of Estuaries and Coasts serves to integrate current understanding of the structure and function of shallow coastal photic systems, illustrate the many drivers that cause change in these systems, and synthesize their varied responses.},

Extrinsic forces operating over broad spatial scales can impart synchronous behavior to separate populations, while internal, system-specific drivers often lead to idiosyncratic behavior. Here, we demonstrate synchrony in community-level dynamics among phytoplankton and bacteria in six north temperate humic lakes. The influence of regional meteorological factors explained much of the temporal variability in the phytoplankton community, and resulted in synchronous patterns of community change among lakes. Bacterial dynamics, in contrast, were driven by system-specific interactions with phytoplankton. Despite the importance of intrinsic factors for determining bacterial community composition and dynamics, we demonstrated that biological interactions transmitted the signal of the regional extrinsic drivers to the bacterial communities, ultimately resulting in synchronous community phenologies for bacterioplankton communities as well. This demonstrates how linkages between the components of a complex biological system can work to simplify the dynamics of the system and implies that it may be possible to predict the behavior of microbial communities responsible for important biogeochemical services in the landscape.},

  abstract = {In riverine water, both suspended particulate material and viruses are prominent ecological factors. The existence of various particle types and differences in viral abundance impose variability in microenvironments. Particulates and their microbial surrounding may interact in several ways, this interaction being strongly dependent on particle quality and the abundance of organisms involved. In laboratory experiments, we used different suspended matter types (fresh and aged mineral sediment and leaf litter, river snow) that typically occur in riverine environments as model particles. We investigated the effects of particle quality and different ambient viral abundances (× 1, × 2 enrichments, and inactivated viruses) on several microbial parameters (changes in bacterial and viral abundances, bacterial production, specific bacterial production) of both the free-living and particle-attached fractions using water from a floodplain system of the Danube River (Austria). Both seston quality and variable viral abundances in the bulk water influenced some microbial parameters. The average abundance of bacteria and viruses was significantly higher on organic than on inorganic particles and on aged particles (for both sediment and leaf litter). Changes in bacterial abundance during the course of the experiments were also influenced by particle quality, with, for example, aged sediment favoring increasing abundances. Virus:bacterium ratios (VBR) were significantly higher on organic than on inorganic particles, but significantly lower on suspended particles than in the planktonic fraction. Typically, bacterial secondary production (overall and cell-specific) was higher on particles than in bulk water. Bacterial productivity in the ambient water was negatively affected by the abundance of planktonic viruses but positively affected by that of attached viruses. These findings from experimental systems may foster in situ studies of particle-rich environments.},

In this study, epibiotic and endobiotic bacteria associated with zooplankton, including barnacle nauplii, veliger larvae, and adults of the copepod Oithona sp., were characterized and quantified. Barnacle nauplius and veliger larva harbored \textasciitilde 4.4 × 105 cells ind−1 whereas Oithona sp. had 8.8 × 105 cells ind−1. Computation of bacterial contribution based on biovolume indicated that despite being the smallest zooplankton tested, veliger larvae harbored the highest number of bacteria, while barnacle nauplii, the largest of the zooplankton, tested in terms of volume contributed the least. Pulverization of zooplankton led to an increase in bacterial numbers; for example, Vibrio cholerae, which was initially 3.5 × 103, increased to 5.4 × 105 CFU g−1; Escherichia coli increased from 5.0 × 102 to 1.3 × 104 CFU g−1; and Streptococcus faecalis increased from 2.1 × 102 to 2.5 × 105 CFU g−1, respectively. Pulverized zooplankton was aged in the dark to assess the contribution of bacteria from decaying debris. Aging of pulverized zooplankton led to emergence of Chromobacterium violaceum, which is an opportunistic pathogen in animals and humans.},

The best results are obtained when the fractal dimension is estimated by a power law function of the floc diameter. The models are compared with observations from 26 published data sets relating floc size to settling velocity measured under various conditions and at different locations. The floc size covered by the data varies between 1.4 and about 25,500 µm. Five commonly used models are also compared to these data and found to reproduce inadequately the full range of the observations. Sensitivity analysis shows that, with the proposed models, the spread in the data may be reproduced by varying the size of primary particles from about 0.05 to 20 µm. The new models are proposed for integration into numerical models to simulate sediment transport of cohesive sediments, contaminants, and biological microorganisms such as phytoplankton.},

This size distribution has been interpreted to be the result of allometric control of growth and respiration rates, but we propose an alternative “random encounter” hypothesis to explain such a distribution. According to this hypothesis, the size distribution of cells that range from 0.3 to 100-mu-m results from size-selective predation by protozoans. A phagotrophic population will swim randomly through the water encountering both prey and predators. At steady state, such a population must ingest smaller prey at a sufficient rate to balance its rate of loss to larger predators. The size distribution of cells must, therefore, satisfy this condition. In particular, a mathematical statement of the hypothesis is based on the following relationships: volume of a cell varies as the cube of its diameter; clearance rate (L3T-1) by a predator varies as the square of its diameter; and, for a given population, its range of possible prey sizes varies with its prey diameter at the same time that the range of predator sizes able to capture the given population varies with its predator diameter.},

  abstract = {Zooplankton organisms are a central part of pelagic ecosystems. They feed on all kinds of particulate matter and their egested fecal pellets contribute substantially to the passive sinking flux to depth. Some zooplankton species also conduct diel vertical migrations (DVMs) between the surface layer (where they feed at nighttime) and midwater depth (where they hide at daytime from predation). These DVMs cause the active export of organic and inorganic matter from the surface layer as zooplankton organisms excrete, defecate, respire, die, and are preyed upon at depth. In the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA), the daytime distribution depth of many migrators (300–600 m) coincides with an expanding and intensifying oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We here assess the day and night-time biomass distribution of mesozooplankton with an equivalent spherical diameter of 0.39–20 mm in three regions of the ETNA, calculate the DVM-mediated fluxes and compare these to particulate matter fluxes and other biogeochemical processes. Integrated mesozooplankton biomass in the ETNA region is about twice as high at a central OMZ location (cOMZ; 11◦ N, 21◦ W) compared to the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory (CVOO; 17.6◦ N, 24.3◦ W) and an oligotrophic location at 5◦ N, 23◦ W (5N). An Intermediate Particle Maximum (IPM) is particularly strong at cOMZ compared to the other regions. This IPM seems to be related to DVM activity. Zooplankton DVM was found to be responsible for about 31–41\% of nitrogen loss from the upper 200m of the water column. Gut flux and mortality make up about 31\% of particulate matter supply to the 300–600 m depth layer at cOMZ, whereas it makes up about 32\% and 41\% at CVOO and 5N, respectively. Resident and migrant zooplankton are responsible for about 7–27\% of the total oxygen demand at 300–600 m depth. Changes in zooplankton abundance and migration behavior due to decreasing oxygen levels at midwater depth could therefore alter the elemental cycling of oxygen and carbon in the ETNA OMZ and impact the removal of nitrogen from the surface layer.},

The lowest fractal dimension of D2 = 1.28 ± 0.11 was calculated for marine snow aggregates composed predominantly of a single type of particle (e.g. diatoms or fecal pellets) containing large amounts of miscellaneous debris. Marine snow formed by the aggregation of fecal pellets (D2 = 1.34 ± 0.16), non-identifiable particles (amorphous, D2 = 1.63 ± 0.72), and diatoms (D2 = 1.86 ± 0.13) had increasingly larger fractal dimensions. When combined into a single group, all marine snow aggregates had a fractal dimension of 1.72 ± 0.07. Larvacean houses, formed originally from a single, nearly spherical particle, were found to have a D2 value close to the Euclidean value of 2. Based on fractal geometrical relationships, D2 should have been equal to previous estimates of D3, a three-dimensional fractal dimension. Instead, the D2 value of 1.72 for the combined group was larger than previous estimates of D3 of 1.39 and 1.52, probably because of the dominant influence of the diatom aggregates on the combined group. Diatom aggregates had the highest fractal dimensions and covered the widest size range of all categories of particles examined.},

The sequenced genes were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and taxonomic information for the sequence-based OTUs was obtained by comparison to public sequence databases. The sequences were then subjected to in silico digestion to predict fragment sizes, and that information was compared to the results of the T-RFLP method applied to the same samples in order to provide taxonomic context for the environmental T-RFLP fragments. A total of 663 and 678 sequences were analyzed for the 5 m and 500 m samples, respectively, which clustered into 157 OTUs and 183 OTUs. The sequences yielded substantially fewer taxonomic units as in silico fragment lengths (i.e., following in silico digestion), and the environmental T-RFLP resulted in the fewest unique OTUs (unique fragments). Bray–Curtis similarity analysis of protistan assemblages was greater using the T-RFLP dataset compared to the sequence-based OTU dataset, presumably due to the inability of the fragment method to differentiate some taxa and an inability to detect many rare taxa relative to the sequence-based approach. Nonetheless, fragments in our analysis generally represented the dominant sequence-based OTUs and putative identifications could be assigned to a majority of the fragments in the environmental T-RFLP results. Our empirical examination of the T-RFLP method identified limitations relative to sequence-based community analysis, but the relative ease and low cost of fragment analysis make this method a useful approach for characterizing the dominant taxa within complex assemblages of microbial eukaryotes in large datasets.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: This study tested the validity of the modified dilution method approach to partition natural phytoplankton mortality into grazer versus virus-induced fractions. A series of experiments was conducted weekly between August and October 2005 from an offshore site in the western English Channel. The phytoplankton community during this period was dominated numerically by Synechococcus spp. and picoeukaryotes. Despite highly significant regression results, no discernible viral lysis of Synechococcus spp. or picoeukaryote populations was apparent during the 3 mo period. Microzooplankton grazing was the major source of mortality for Synechococcus spp. and picoeukaryotes during this time. Statistical analysis indicates that, using our experimental design, the modified dilution approach was not sensitive enough to be able to measure significant viral lysis during the experimental period. Sensitivity analysis indicated that viral mortality occurred at rates of {$<$}0.1 d–1. Methodological impacts on phytoplankton growth rates may also have affected the ability to measure virus-induced mortality of picoeukaryotes, as there was increasing suppression of picoeukaryote growth rate in relation to dilution with the 30 kDa filtrate and a corresponding depression of quantum photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) in the 30 kDa dilutions compared to the 0.2 µm series. The implications and limitations of the dilution approach for estimating viral versus grazing mortality of natural phytoplankton populations are discussed.},

Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism was used for the analysis of 237 samples that were collected between September 2000 and December 2010. Spatiotemporal variability patterns of microeukaryote assemblages indicated the presence of distinct shallow and deep communities at the SPOT station, presumably reflecting taxa that were specifically adapted for the conditions in those environments. Community similarity values between assemblages collected 1 month apart at each depth ranged between \textasciitilde 20\% and \textasciitilde 84\% (averages were \textasciitilde 50–59\%). The assemblage at 5 m was temporally more dynamic than deeper assemblages and also displayed substantial interannual variability during the first \textasciitilde 3 years of the study. Evidence of seasonality was detected for the microbial eukaryote assemblage at 5 m between January 2008 and December 2010 and at 150 m between September 2000 and December 2003. Seasonality was not detected for assemblages at the deep chlorophyll a maximum, which varied in depth seasonally, or at 500 m. Microbial eukaryote assemblages exhibited cyclical patterns in at least 1 year at each depth, implying an annual resetting of communities. Substantial interannual variability was detected for assemblages at all depths and represented the largest source of temporal variability in this temperate coastal ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The present study shows a previously undocumented role of dissolved organic matter in the marine carbonate system. During photosynthesis, phytoplankton release dissolved organic compounds containing basic functional groups that readily react with protons during seawater titration, and thereby contribute to alkalinity (a measure of buffering capacity). The magnitude of the contribution of dissolved organic compounds to seawater alkalinity is species dependent, suggesting that individual phytoplankton species exude dissolved organic compounds with unique proton accepting capacities. Our study shows that dissolved organic matter produced by marine phytoplankton during photosynthesis is a newly identified buffering component in the ocean, and indicates that the contribution of dissolved organic matter to seawater alkalinity can be significant in the biologically productive upper ocean, where to date it has been unrecognized or considered insignificant.},

Stomach microbiomes in oysters from Hackberry Bay were overwhelmingly dominated by Mollicutes most closely related to Mycoplasma; a more rich community dominated by Planctomyctes occurred in Lake Caillou oyster stomachs. Gut communities for oysters from both sites differed from stomach communities, and harbored a relatively diverse assemblage of phylotypes. Phylotypes most closely related to Shewanella and a Chloroflexi strain dominated the Lake Caillou and Hackberry Bay gut microbiota, respectively. While many members of the stomach and gut microbiomes appeared to be transients or opportunists, a putative core microbiome was identified based on phylotypes that occurred in all stomach or gut samples only. The putative core stomach microbiome comprised 5 OTUs in 3 phyla, while the putative core gut microbiome contained 44 OTUs in 12 phyla. These results collectively revealed novel microbial communities within the oyster digestive system, the functions of the oyster microbiome are largely unknown. A comparison of microbiomes from Louisiana oysters with bacterial communities reported for other marine invertebrates and fish indicated that molluscan microbiomes were more similar to each other than to microbiomes of polychaetes, decapods and fish.},

Methodologists and statisticians agree that "multiple imputation" is a superior approach to the problem of missing data scattered through one's explanatory and dependent variables than the methods currently used in applied data analysis. The discrepancy occurs because the computational algorithms used to apply the best multiple imputation models have been slow, difficult to implement, impossible to run with existing commercial statistical packages, and have demanded considerable expertise. We adapt an algorithm and use it to implement a general-purpose, multiple imputation model for missing data. This algorithm is considerably faster and easier to use than the leading method recommended in the statistics literature. We also quantify the risks of current missing data practices, illustrate how to use the new procedure, and evaluate this alternative through simulated data as well as actual empirical examples. Finally, we offer easy-to-use software that implements all methods discussed.},

However, aggregates are also sites of elevated heterotrophic activity, which may rather cause enhanced retention of aggregated material in the upper ocean. Small-scale biological-physical interactions govern the formation and fate of marine snow. Aggregates may form by physical coagulation: fluid motion causes collisions between small primary particles (e.g. phytoplankton) that may then stick together to form aggregates with enhanced sinking velocities. Bacteria may subsequently solubilise and remineralise aggregated particles. Because the solubilization rate exceeds the remineralization rate, organic solutes leak out of sinking aggregates. The leaking solutes spread by diffusion and advection and form a chemical trail in the wake of the sinking aggregate that may guide small zooplankters to the aggregate. Also, suspended bacteria may enjoy the elevated concentration of organic solutes in the plume. I explore these small-scale formation and degradation processes by means of models, experiments and field observations. The larger scale implications for the structure and functioning of pelagic food chains of export vs. retention of material will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Flocculation of ‘sticky’ phytoplankton cells into rapidly sinking aggregates has been invoked as a mechanism explaining mass sedimentation of phytoplankton blooms in the ocean. Phytoplankton stickiness, defined as the probability of adhesion upon collision, is one key factor determining the potential for aggregate formation. In the laboratory, we examined variation in stickiness in five species of diatoms and two species of flagellates grown in batch cultures. We also investigated the production of paniculate mucus by phytoplankton cells and its role in aggregate formation, and we studied the effects of solute exudates on cell stickiness. Four of the five diatoms investigated were significantly sticky, while one diatom and both of the flagellates were not sticky. Stickiness varied considerably within species. In the diatom Skeletonema costatum, the typical but not entirely consistent pattern was that stickiness decreased with age of the batch cultures. We were otherwise unable to establish consistent relationships between cell stickiness and the growth stage of the algae, environmental concentrations of inorganic nutrients, and abundances of suspended and epiphytic bacteria. We showed that the diatom S.costatum at times excretes a solute substance that depresses flocculation. This may reduce cell losses from the euphotic zone during the growth phase due to flocculation and sedimentation. We demonstrated two different mechanisms of phytoplankton aggregate formation. In the diatom S.costatum, the cells are sticky in themselves, and coagulation depends on cell-cell sticking and does not involve mucus. Aggregates are composed solely of cells. Cells of the diatom Chaetoceros affinis, on the other hand, are not in themselves sticky. Transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP), produced by the diatom, cause the cells to aggregate and coagulation depends on TEP-cell rather than cell-cell sticking. Aggregates are formed of a mixture of mucus and cells. We found several species of diatoms and one flagellate species to produce copious amounts of TEP. TEP from some species (e.g. Coscinodiscus sp.) is sticky and may cause other, non-sticky particles to coagulate. This emphasizes the potential importance of diatom-derived paniculate mucus for particle flocculation in the ocean.},

  pages = {18},
  abstract = {This paper examines how turbulence influences two very basic properties of planktonic ecosystems, namely trophic interactions and vertical flux of particulate material. It starts with a simple account of classical particle encounter theory which forms the basis of the substance of both problems. Turbulent fluid motion will bring suspended particles to collide, and the basic equations describing the collision rate as a function of dissipation rate and particle size, concentration and motility will be presented. The classical (coagulation) theory is then applied to marine snow formation in the ocean: colliding suspended particles may stick together and form mm-cm sized aggregates (marine snow). These aggregates are believed to account for the vertical flux of matter in the ocean. Aggregation of microscopic phytoplankton cells is a special case. Examples from laboratory and field experiments are used to demonstrate how phytoplankton cells may coagulate, how their stickiness may be measured, how coagulation determines the sedimentation of particulate matter in the ocean, and how it may control the population dynamics of phytoplankton. Subsequently the collision equations are used to describe how planktivorous predators encounter prey in turbulent environments, and the equations are modified to take predator and prey behaviour into account. Simple equations that describe prey encounter rates for cruising predators, suspension feeders, ambush feeders, and pause-travel predators in calm and turbulent water are derived. The influence of fluid motion on postencounter prey capture (pursuit success) is examined. Experimental results on various copepod and larval fish predators will be used to illustrate the theory. Finally, the significance of size and behaviour is discussed. It is shown that turbulence is potentially very important for prey encounter in mm-cm sized planktonic predators, while it is unimportant for most larger and smaller ones.},

  abstract = {Leucine incorporation was examined as a method for estimating rates of protein synthesis by bacterial assemblages in natural aquatic systems. The proportion of the total bacterial population that took up leucine in three marine environments was high (greater than 50\%). Most of the leucine (greater than 90\%) taken up was incorporated into protein, and little (less than 20\%) was degraded to other amino acids, except in two oligotrophic marine environments. In samples from these two environments, ca. 50\% of the leucine incorporated had been degraded to other amino acids, which were subsequently incorporated into protein. The degree of leucine degradation appears to depend on the organic carbon supply, as the proportion of 3H-radioactivity incorporated into protein that was recovered as [3H]leucine after acid hydrolysis increased with the addition of pyruvate to oligotrophic water samples. The addition of extracellular leucine inhibited total incorporation of [14C]pyruvate (a precursor for leucine biosynthesis) into protein. Furthermore, the proportion of [14C]pyruvate incorporation into protein that was recovered as [14C]leucine decreased with the addition of extracellular leucine. These results show that the addition of extracellular leucine inhibits leucine biosynthesis by marine bacterial assemblages. The molar fraction of leucine in a wide variety of proteins is constant, indicating that changes in leucine incorporation rates reflect changes in rates of protein synthesis rather than changes in the leucine content of proteins. The results demonstrate that the incorporation rate of [3H]leucine into a hot trichloroacetic acid-insoluble cell fraction can serve as an index of protein synthesis by bacterial assemblages in aquatic systems.},

We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.},

  abstract = {Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) was recently found to be the most abundant RNA virus in human feces, and is a plant virus belonging to the genus Tobamovirus in the family Virgoviridae. When in human feces, it is of dietary origin from peppers and their processed products, and is excreted from a large proportion of healthy human populations, but rarely found in animal feces. Over the past decade, this virus has been increasingly attracting research attention as a potential viral indicator for human fecal pollution in aquatic environments and water treatment systems. Results presented in the literature reveal that PMMoV is globally distributed and present in various water sources in greater abundance than human pathogenic viruses, without substantial seasonal fluctuations. Several studies report that increased concentrations of PMMoV tend to be correlated with increased fecal contamination in general, along with more frequent detection of pathogenic enteric viruses. PMMoV also exhibits remarkable stability in water under various environmental conditions. Here, we review recent advancements in our understanding of the occurrence and persistence of PMMoV in natural and engineered water systems and discuss its advantages and limitations as a viral indicator for improved microbial water quality management.},

Nevertheless, a 38~kHz echosounder identified at least four distinct scattering layers during the daytime, of which the 2 deepest layers resided entirely within the mesopelagic zone. Two of the acoustic layers were found above a mesopelagic oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), one layer overlapped with the OMZ, and one layer was found below the OMZ. Almost all organisms in the deep layers migrated to the near-surface waters during the night. Backscatter from a 300~kHz lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler indicated a layer of zooplankton within the OMZ. They carried out DVM, yet a portion remained at mesopelagic depths during the night. Our acoustic measurements showed that the bulk of the acoustic backscatter was restricted to waters shallower than 800~m, suggesting that most of the biomass in the Red Sea resides above this depth.},

Temporal variations in the chemical loads resulted from the large changes in the water flow rates and in the particle-associated contaminant concentrations. Concentrations of PCBs and PAHs in river particles (ng/g) were twice as great as those in the northern Chesapeake Bay, indicating that the Susquehanna River is an important source of these contaminants to the bay. The river carries a majority of its hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in the particulate phase. During periods of high flow, large amounts of suspended particles in the river result in elevated HOC levels and increased loadings of these contaminants to the bay. From 1997 to 1998, 60\% of the total annual HOC loading occurred in the early spring coincident with high river flows. The total PCB and PAH annual loadings from the Susquehanna River to the Chesapeake Bay were 76 and 3160 kg/year, respectively and 75\% of the loaded organic contaminants were in the particulate phase. Principal component analysis of PAH and PCB congener patterns in the particles reveals that the river suspended particles were dominated by autochthonous production in the summer and by resuspended sediment and watershed erosion during the winter and early spring.},

  abstract = {Zooplankton feeding activity is hypothesized to attenuate the downward flux of elements in the ocean. We investigated whether the zooplankton community composition could influence the flux attenuation, due to the differences of feeding modes (feeding on dispersed vs. aggregated particles) and of metabolic rates. We fed 5 copepod species-three calanoid, one harpacticoid and one poecilamastoid-microplankton food, in either dispersed or aggregated form and measured rates of respiration, fecal pellet production and egg production. Calanoid copepods were able to feed only on dispersed food; when their food was introduced as aggregates, their pellet production and respiration rates decreased to rates observed for starved individuals. In contrast, harpacticoids and the poecilamastoid copepod Oncaea spp. were able to feed only when the food was in the form of aggregates. The sum of copepod respiration, pellet production and egg production rates was equivalent to a daily minimum carbon demand of ca. 10\% body weight-1 for all non-feeding copepods; the carbon demand of calanoids feeding on dispersed food was 2-3 times greater, and the carbon demand of harpacticoids and Oncaea spp. feeding on aggregates was {$>$}7 times greater, than the resting rates. The zooplankton species composition combined with the type of available food strongly influences the calculated carbon demand of a copepod community, and thus also the attenuation of vertical carbon flux.},

  abstract = {A new method of retrieving the parameters of a power-law particle size distribution (PSD) from ocean color remote sensing data was used to assess the global distribution and dynamics of phytoplankton functional types (PFT's). The method retrieves the power-law slope, ξ, and the abundance at a reference diameter, N0, based upon the shape and magnitude of the particulate backscattering coefficient spectrum. Relating the PSD to PFT's on global scales assumes that the open ocean particulate assemblage is biogenic. The retrieved PSD's can be integrated to define three size-based PFT's by the percent volume concentration contribution of three phytoplankton size classes – picoplankton (0.5–2 μm in equivalent spherical diameter), nanoplankton (2–20 μm) and microplankton (20–50 μm). Validation with in-situ HPLC diagnostic pigments resulted in better match-ups for the pico- and micro-phytoplankton size classes as compared to nanoplankton. Global decadal averages derived from SeaWiFS monthly data reveal PFT and particle abundance spatial patterns that are consistent with current understanding. Oligotrophic gyres are characterized by lower particle abundance and higher contribution by picoplankton-sized particles than transitional or eutrophic regions. Seasonal succession patterns for size-based PFT's reveal good correspondence between increasing chlorophyll concentration and percent contribution by microplankton, as well as increasing particle abundance. Long-term trends in particle abundances are generally well correlated with the MEI index indicating increased oligotrophy (i.e. lower particle abundance and increased contribution of picoplankton-sized particles) during the warm phase of an El Niño event. This work demonstrates the utility and future potential of assessing phytoplankton functional types using remote characterization of the particle size distribution.},

  abstract = {The particle size distribution (PSD) provides important information about pelagic ocean ecosystem structure and function. Knowledge of the PSD and its changes in time can be used to assess the contributions made by phytoplankton functional groups to primary production, particle sinking, and carbon sequestration by the ocean. However, few field measurements of the PSD have been made in the pelagic ocean, and little is known about its space-time variation. Here, a novel bio-optical algorithm is introduced to retrieve the parameters of a power law particle size spectrum from satellite ocean color observations. First, the particle backscattering coefficient spectrum, bbp(λ), is retrieved from monthly Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) normalized water-leaving radiance observations following Loisel et al. (2006). Mie modeling is then used to estimate the parameters of a power law PSD (the PSD slope and the particle differential number concentration for a given reference diameter) as a function of the particulate backscattering spectrum. Algorithm uncertainties are greater when bbp(λ) slopes are low, which occurs in high-productivity areas. Satellite-based retrievals of PSD parameters are reasonably consistent with available field observations. As an example, the algorithm was applied to monthly SeaWiFS global imagery from August 2007. Global spatial distributions show subtropical oligotrophic gyres characterized by higher PSD slopes and smaller particle number concentrations, as compared with coastal and other high-productivity areas. Partitioning particle number and volume concentrations into picophytoplankton-, nanophytoplankton-, and microphytoplankton-sized classes indicates that the abundance of picoplankton-sized particles is roughly constant spatially and that they dominate the particle volume concentrations in oligotrophic regions. On the other hand, abundances of microplankton-sized particles vary over many orders of magnitude, and they contribute to volume concentration only in the highest-productivity areas. These results are consistent with current understanding of particle dynamics of pelagic ecosystems and provide new tools for biogeochemical modeling and assessment of the global ocean ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Think-Pair-Share (TPS) is a classroom-based active learning strategy, in which students work on a problem posed by the instructor, first individually, then in pairs, and finally as a class-wide discussion. TPS has been recommended for its benefits of allowing students to express their reasoning, reflect on their thinking, and obtain immediate feedback on their understanding. While TPS is intended to promote student engagement, there is a need for research based evidence on the nature of this engagement. In this study, we investigate the quantity and quality of student engagement in a large CS1 class during the implementation of TPS activities. We did classroom observations of students over a period of ten weeks and thirteen TPS activities. We determined patterns of student engagement in the three phases using a real-time classroom observation protocol that we developed and validated. We found that 83\% of students on average were fully or mostly engaged. Predominant behaviors displayed were writing the solution to the problem (Think), discussing with neighbor or writing (Pair), and following class discussion (Share). We triangulated results with survey data of student perceptions. We find that students report being highly engaged for 62\% during Think phase and 70\% during Pair phase.},

  abstract = {Conventional bacterial growth studies rely on large bacterial populations without considering the individual cells. Individual cells, however, can exhibit marked behavioral heterogeneity. Here, we present experimental observations on the colonial growth of 220 individual cells of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium using time-lapse microscopy videos. We found a highly heterogeneous behavior. Some cells did not grow, showing filamentation or lysis before division. Cells that were able to grow and form microcolonies showed highly diverse growth dynamics. The quality of the videos allowed for counting the cells over time and estimating the kinetic parameters lag time (λ) and maximum specific growth rate (μmax) for each microcolony originating from a single cell. To interpret the observations, the variability of the kinetic parameters was characterized using appropriate probability distributions and introduced to a stochastic model that allows for taking into account heterogeneity using Monte Carlo simulation. The model provides stochastic growth curves demonstrating that growth of single cells or small microbial populations is a pool of events each one of which has its own probability to occur. Simulations of the model illustrated how the apparent variability in population growth gradually decreases with increasing initial population size (N0). For bacterial populations with N0 of {$>$}100 cells, the variability is almost eliminated and the system seems to behave deterministically, even though the underlying law is stochastic. We also used the model to demonstrate the effect of the presence and extent of a nongrowing population fraction on the stochastic growth of bacterial populations.},

  abstract = {Rapid advances in sequencing technology have changed the experimental landscape of microbial ecology. In the last 10 years, the field has moved from sequencing hundreds of 16S rRNA gene fragments per study using clone libraries to the sequencing of millions of fragments per study using next-generation sequencing technologies from 454 and Illumina. As these technologies advance, it is critical to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and overall suitability of these platforms for the interrogation of microbial communities. Here, we present an improved method for sequencing variable regions within the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina's MiSeq platform, which is currently capable of producing paired 250-nucleotide reads. We evaluated three overlapping regions of the 16S rRNA gene that vary in length (i.e., V34, V4, and V45) by resequencing a mock community and natural samples from human feces, mouse feces, and soil. By titrating the concentration of 16S rRNA gene amplicons applied to the flow cell and using a quality score-based approach to correct discrepancies between reads used to construct contigs, we were able to reduce error rates by as much as two orders of magnitude. Finally, we reprocessed samples from a previous study to demonstrate that large numbers of samples could be multiplexed and sequenced in parallel with shotgun metagenomes. These analyses demonstrate that our approach can provide data that are at least as good as that generated by the 454 platform while providing considerably higher sequencing coverage for a fraction of the cost.},

  abstract = {A model is presented that simulates the formation of marine aggregates from particles of different origin inside a model of pelagic biological processes. Experiments are carried out with parameterizations appropriate for different types of aggregates, using different kinds of physical forcing, and compared to observations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), marine snow concentration, and sedimentation. The occurrence of large, macroscopically visible aggregates (marine snow) can best be simulated with parameterizations that have been derived from in situ observations of marine snow, but not with a parameterization sufficient for dense particles. The parameterization strongly determines the amount and timing of deep export, as well as the post-bloom development of the food web in the upper layers. Detritus in aggregates plays a role mainly during times when zooplankton are abundant, as e.g. in the western Arabian Sea during Southwest Monsoon. Then the large aggregates as fast sinking vehicles may remove detritus quickly from shallow and mid-water depth, preventing the accumulation of nutrients that are produced via detritus decomposition. In this region, detritus contributes strongly to deep sedimentation. The nitrogen budget at this location with regard to the observations cannot be closed: depending on model type, either the model simulates too high sedimentation, or too high DIN. Possible causes for this mismatch include undercollection by sediment traps, inaccurate representation of physical processes in the model and the neglect of biological processes, such as production of dissolved organic matter or denitrification.},

  abstract = {The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is directly linked to the sinking of photosynthetically derived particulate organic carbon (POC) from surface waters to deep waters. This process, known as the marine biological carbon pump, removes carbon from exchange with the atmosphere, thus regulating global climate. Recent evidence suggests that microbial chemical communication systems (e.g. quorum sensing) amongst heterotrophic bacteria associated with sinking POC, significantly influences their hydrolytic enzyme activity and, as such, may affect the efficiency of the biological carbon pump. Here, we present data showing that a class of quorum sensing molecules, acylated homeserine lactones (AHLs) substantially impact hydrolytic phosphatase, aminopeptidase, and lipase activity in samples of sinking particles collected from the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Incubations of sinking particles amended with exogenous AHLs showed both stimulated and inhibited rates of activity after 24 hours of incubation, suggesting a critical link between bacterial AHL signaling mechanisms and the rate of POC degradation. Further experiments reveal that hydrolytic pathways could be affected within a few hours of amendment with AHLs, suggesting that microbial communities are able to dynamically modify their metabolic pathways in response to perceived quorum sensing. Finally, the concentration of the AHL amendment also affected hydrolytic activity. Our results indicated that quorum sensing has the potential to influence hydrolytic activity in a range of oceanic environments, but response also vary significantly as a function of the type of AHL, their concentration, and response time. AHL-based quorum sensing may be thought of as a global language among marine bacteria, but it is highly complex.},

Fecal DNA is the primary source for the majority of human gut microbiome studies.

In the current study, we demonstrate a quick, robust, unbiased, and cost-effective method for the isolation of high molecular weight ({$>$}23kb) metagenomic DNA (260/280 ratio {$>$}1.8) with a good yield (55.8±3.8ng/mg of feces). We also confirm that there is very low human genomic DNA contamination (eubacterial: human genomic DNA marker genes=227.9:1) in the human feces. The newly-developed method robustly performs for fresh as well as stored fecal samples as demonstrated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing using 454 FLX+. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene analysis indicated that compared to other DNA extraction methods tested, the fecal metagenomic DNA isolated with current methodology retains species richness and does not show microbial diversity biases, which is further confirmed by qPCR with a known quantity of spike-in genomes. Overall, our data highlight a protocol with a balance between quality, amount, user-friendliness, and cost effectiveness for its suitability toward usage for culture-independent analysis of the human gut microbiome, which provides a robust solution to overcome key issues associated with fecal metagenomic DNA isolation in human gut microbiome studies.},

While PLFAs have been widely used as quantitative bacterial biomarkers in marine sediments, applications of quinone analysis in marine sediments are very limited. In this study, we investigated the relation between both groups of bacterial biomarkers in a broad range of marine sediments from the intertidal zone to the deep sea. We found a good log-log correlation between concentrations of bacterial PLFA and RQ over several orders of magnitude. This relationship is probably due to metabolic variation in quinone concentrations in bacterial cells in different environments, whereas PLFA concentrations are relatively stable under different conditions. We also found a good agreement in the community structure classifications based on the bacterial PLFAs and RQs. These results strengthen the application of both compounds as quantitative bacterial biomarkers. Moreover, the bacterial PLFA- and RQ profiles revealed a comparable dissimilarity pattern of the sampled sediments, but with a higher level of dissimilarity for the RQs. This means that the quinone method has a higher resolution for resolving differences in bacterial community composition. Combining PLFA and quinone analysis as a complementary method is a good strategy to yield higher resolving power in bacterial community structure.},

  abstract = {16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and other environmental sequencing techniques provide snapshots of microbial communities, revealing phylogeny and the abundances of microbial populations across diverse ecosystems. While changes in microbial community structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental conditions (from metabolic and immunological health in mammals to ecological stability in soils and oceans), identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from amplicon-based datasets are compositional. Counts are normalized to the total number of counts in the sample. Thus, microbial abundances are not independent, and traditional statistical metrics (e.g., correlation) for the detection of OTU-OTU relationships can lead to spurious results. Secondly, microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU association networks is severely under-powered, and additional information (or assumptions) are required for accurate inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association Inference), a statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks from amplicon sequencing datasets that addresses both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations developed for compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that assumes the underlying ecological association network is sparse. To reconstruct the network, SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. To provide a synthetic benchmark in the absence of an experimentally validated gold-standard network, SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a set of computational tools to generate OTU count data from a set of diverse underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods to recover edges and network properties on synthetic data under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously unknown microbial associations using data from the American Gut project.},

  abstract = {As particulate organic carbon rains down from the surface ocean it is respired back to carbon dioxide and released into the ocean's interior. The depth at which this sinking carbon is converted back to carbon dioxide—known as the remineralization depth—depends on the balance between particle sinking speeds and their rate of decay. A host of climate-sensitive factors can affect this balance, including temperature, oxygen concentration, stratification, community composition and the mineral content of the sinking particles. Here we use a three-dimensional global ocean biogeochemistry model to show that a modest change in remineralization depth can have a substantial impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. For example, when the depth at which 63\% of sinking carbon is respired increases by 24 m globally, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall by 10–27 ppm. This reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration results from the redistribution of remineralized carbon from intermediate waters to bottom waters. As a consequence of the reduced concentration of respired carbon in upper ocean waters, atmospheric carbon dioxide is preferentially stored in newly formed North Atlantic Deep Water. We suggest that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are highly sensitive to the potential changes in remineralization depth that may be caused by climate change.},

  abstract = {We present a systematic parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis of a three-dimensional global ocean biogeochemistry model. We use the global data sets of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), alkalinity, and phosphate to constrain the parameters of a biogeochemistry model which include the stoichiometric ratios rC:P and rN:P, the fraction σ of organic material production allocated to dissolved organic matter (DOM), the lifetime 1/κ of DOM, the exponent α in the power law for the depth profile of the remineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC), the rain ratio R of CaCO3, and the e-folding length scale d for the depth profile of CaCO3 dissolution. The data-constrained parameter values are rC:P = 137 ± 11, σ = 0.74 ± 0.04, 1/κ = 1.7 ± 0.5 years, α = −0.97 ± 0.07, R = 0.081 ± 0.008, and d = 2100 ± 300 m. The postoptimization carbon export from POC is 15 ± 1 Gt/a and from CaCO3 is 1.2 ± 0.1 Gt/a of which 67 ± 4\% dissolves above 2000 m. The ± ranges indicate an average 1\% decrease in the fraction of the spatial variance in the observed tracer data captured by the model. The sensitivity of the model to its parameters is presented in terms of sensitivity patterns defined as the derivative of the model's equilibrium tracer distribution with respect to the parameters (S patterns). The soft-tissue, carbonate, and gas exchange pump mechanisms responsible for the sensitivities are presented. The pump decomposition of the S patterns illustrates quantitatively how changes in organic and inorganic carbon fluxes are coupled with the large-scale ocean circulation and how the gas exchange pump couples to the global ventilation patterns through changes in surface chemistry.},

Here we present the results from a metagenomic study of composite samples from temperate (Saanich Inlet, 11 samples; Strait of Georgia, 85 samples) and subtropical (46 samples, Gulf of Mexico) seawater. Most sequences (84\%) had no evident similarity to sequenced viruses. In total, 608 putative complete genomes of ssDNA viruses were assembled, almost doubling the number of ssDNA viral genomes in databases. These comprised 129 genetically distinct groups, each represented by at least one complete genome that had no recognizable similarity to each other or to other virus sequences. Given that the seven recognized families of ssDNA viruses have considerable sequence homology within them, this suggests that many of these genetic groups may represent new viral families. Moreover, nearly 70\% of the sequences were similar to one of these genomes, indicating that most of the sequences could be assigned to a genetically distinct group. Most sequences fell within 11 well-defined gene groups, each sharing a common gene. Some of these encoded putative replication and coat proteins that had similarity to sequences from viruses infecting eukaryotes, suggesting that these were likely from viruses infecting eukaryotic phytoplankton and zooplankton.},

But bacterial distributions have not been mapped at a global scale. Although current community surveys are way too sparse to map global diversity patterns directly, there is now sufficient data to fit accurate models of how bacterial distributions vary across different environments and to make global scale maps from these models. We apply this approach to map the global distributions of bacteria in marine surface waters. Our spatially and temporally explicit predictions suggest that bacterial diversity peaks in temperate latitudes across the world’s oceans. These global peaks are seasonal, occurring 6 months apart in the two hemispheres, in the boreal and austral winters. This pattern is quite different from the tropical, seasonally consistent diversity patterns observed for most macroorganisms. However, like other marine organisms, surface water bacteria are particularly diverse in regions of high human environmental impacts on the oceans. Our maps provide the first picture of bacterial distributions at a global scale and suggest important differences between the diversity patterns of bacteria compared with other organisms.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial organisms or other contaminants that are transported to Mars could interfere with efforts to study the potential for indigenous martian life. Similarly, contaminants that make the round-trip to Mars and back to Earth could compromise the ability to discriminate an authentic martian biosignature from a terrestrial organism. For this reason, it is important to develop a comprehensive inventory of microbes that are present on spacecraft to avoid interpreting their traces as authentic extraterrestrial biosignatures. Culture-based methods are currently used by NASA to assess spacecraft cleanliness but deliberately detect only a very small subset of total organisms present. The National Research Council has recommended that molecular (DNA)-based identification techniques should be developed as one aspect of managing the risk that terrestrial contamination could interfere with detection of life on (or returned from) Mars. The current understanding of the microbial diversity associated with spacecraft and clean room surfaces is expanding, but the capability to generate a comprehensive inventory of the microbial populations present on spacecraft outbound from Earth would address multiple considerations in planetary protection, relevant to both robotic and human missions. To this end, a 6-year genetic inventory study was undertaken by a NASA/JPL team. It was completed in 2012 and included delivery of a publicly available comprehensive final report. The genetic inventory study team evaluated the utility of three analytical technologies (conventional cloning techniques, PhyloChip DNA microarrays, and 454 tag-pyrosequencing) and combined them with a systematic methodology to collect, process, and archive nucleic acids as the first steps in assessing the phylogenetic breadth of microorganisms on spacecraft and associated surfaces.

  abstract = {In assessing the bacterial populations present in spacecraft assembly, spacecraft test, and launch preparation facilities, extremophilic bacteria (requiring severe conditions for growth) and extremotolerant bacteria (tolerant to extreme conditions) were isolated. Several cultivation approaches were employed to select for and identify bacteria that not only survive the nutrient-limiting conditions of clean room environments but can also withstand even more inhospitable environmental stresses. Due to their proximity to spacefaring objects, these bacteria pose a considerable risk for forward contamination of extraterrestrial sites. Samples collected from four geographically distinct National Aeronautics and Space Administration clean rooms were challenged with UV-C irradiation, 5\% hydrogen peroxide, heat shock, pH extremes (pH 3.0 and 11.0), temperature extremes (4°C to 65°C), and hypersalinity (25\% NaCl) prior to and/or during cultivation as a means of selecting for extremotolerant bacteria. Culture-independent approaches were employed to measure viable microbial (ATP-based) and total bacterial (quantitative PCR-based) burdens. Intracellular ATP concentrations suggested a viable microbial presence ranging from below detection limits to 106 cells/m2. However, only 0.1 to 55\% of these viable cells were able to grow on defined culture medium. Isolated members of the Bacillaceae family were more physiologically diverse than those reported in previous studies, including thermophiles (Geobacillus), obligate anaerobes (Paenibacillus), and halotolerant, alkalophilic species (Oceanobacillus and Exiguobacterium). Non-spore-forming microbes (α- and β-proteobacteria and actinobacteria) exhibiting tolerance to the selected stresses were also encountered. The multiassay cultivation approach employed herein enhances the current understanding of the physiological diversity of bacteria housed in these clean rooms and leads us to ponder the origin and means of translocation of thermophiles, anaerobes, and halotolerant alkalophiles into these environments.},

Sodocalcic glass wool filtration is a cost-effective and easy-to-use method to retain viruses, but its efficiency and reliability are not adequately understood. This study evaluated glass wool filter performance to concentrate the four viruses on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency contaminant candidate list, i.e., coxsackievirus, echovirus, norovirus, and adenovirus, as well as poliovirus. Total virus numbers recovered were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR); infectious polioviruses were quantified by integrated cell culture (ICC)-qRT-PCR. Recovery efficiencies averaged 70\% for poliovirus, 14\% for coxsackievirus B5, 19\% for echovirus 18, 21\% for adenovirus 41, and 29\% for norovirus. Virus strain and water matrix affected recovery, with significant interaction between the two variables. Optimal recovery was obtained at pH 6.5. No evidence was found that water volume, filtration rate, and number of viruses seeded influenced recovery. The method was successful in detecting indigenous viruses in municipal wells in Wisconsin. Long-term continuous filtration retained viruses sufficiently for their detection for up to 16 days after seeding for qRT-PCR and up to 30 days for ICC-qRT-PCR. Glass wool filtration is suitable for large-volume samples (1,000 liters) collected at high filtration rates (4 liters min−1), and its low cost makes it advantageous for studies requiring large numbers of samples.},

  abstract = {As part of the VERTIGO program, we collected and analyzed sinking particles using tethered and neutrally buoyant sediment traps at three depths in the oceanic mesopelagic zone and at two biogeochemically contrasting sites (N. Central Pacific at ALOHA; N. Pacific Western Subarctic Gyre at K2). This effort represented the first large-scale use of neutrally buoyant traps and represents a significant step forward in the study of the marine biological pump. In this paper, we present the results of mass, macronutrient, biominerals and phytoplankton pigment determinations made on these samples. The impact of a variety of potential collection biases were examined, including those from in-trap particle degradation, zooplankton swimmers and poisons. Though these factors have been observed to affect results in other programs, we found them to have relatively little impact on measured fluxes in this study. There was evidence, however, that the neutrally buoyant traps performed better than the tethered traps in terms of flux accuracy during one deployment, possibly because of improved large particle collection efficiency. Fluxes of material exhibited three different patterns through the mesopelagic: increasing, decreasing and constant with depth. Decreasing fluxes with depth were observed for all biogenic material formed in the euphotic zone. The attenuation of flux with depth was not the same for all components, however, with phytoplankton pigments exhibiting the greatest degradation with depth and particulate inorganic carbon the least. Organic carbon and nitrogen showed a very high correlation in these samples, with little evidence of different attenuation length scales. Increasing fluxes with depth were observed for particulate Ba at both sites and Al at K2. The increases in Ba are attributed to the formation of barite in degrading particles, while increasing Al at K2 was the result of lateral inputs from a continental shelf/slope. Constant fluxes with depth were observed for Al at ALOHA, where fluxes appeared to be in steady state with atmospheric dust deposition. The mesopelagic zone at K2 was observed to attenuate particle flux less than at ALOHA, and with a higher POC/PIC (“rain”) ratio. These two factors combine to imply that the Subarctic province had a much more efficient biological pump than had the subtropical gyre during our occupations. This could be the result of either faster sinking particles, generated from grazing by large zooplankton, or inherently slower particle degradation rates.},

The current high-throughput sequencing revolution, in addition to advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics, have recently enabled deep access to these complex environments, and are revealing important insights into the roles of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in host physiology and health. This review discusses examples of how the integration of cutting-edge ‘meta-omics’ technologies are providing new knowledge about the relationships between host health status in mammals and the microbes inhabiting the GI tract. In addition, we address some promises that these techniques hold for future therapeutic and diagnostic applications.},

  abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) harbor unique microbial communities that rely on alternative electron acceptors for respiration. Conditions therein enable an almost complete nitrogen (N) cycle and substantial N-loss. Nloss in OMZs is attributable to anammox and heterotrophic denitrification, whereas nitrate reduction to nitrite along with dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium are major remineralization pathways. Despite virtually anoxic conditions, nitrification also occurs in OMZs, converting remineralized ammonium to N-oxides. The concurrence of all these processes provides a direct channel from organic N to the ultimate N-loss, whereas most individual processes are likely controlled by organic matter. Many microorganisms inhabiting the OMZs are capable of multiple functions in the N- and other elemental cycles. Their versatile metabolic potentials versus actual activities present a challenge to ecophysiological and biogeochemical measurements. These challenges need to be tackled before we can realistically predict how N-cycling in OMZs, and thus oceanic N-balance, will respond to future global perturbations.},

  abstract = {Copepod faecal pellets have often been considered as rapid transporters of material out of the euphotic zone. Laboratory experiments on their degradation and sinking rates support this view, but field data on the distribution and flux of pellets through the water colomn present contradictory evidence. We suggest that due to the exclusion of metazoans from previously published degradation experiments, such studies may have little relevance to the natural environments. In 1987/1988 we carried out experiments using adult copepods of mixed species but dominated byCentropages hamatus collected in Kiel Bight (FRG). We have demonstrated that copepods can be highly adept at breaking up their own pellets while ingesting only a small proportion, a behaviour we define as “coprorhexy”. The microbiota is probably unable to cause significant modification to faecal pellets before they are fragmented within a few hours of their production. Thereafter, microbial remineralisation will become important. Many of the “difficult” field data can be readily explained if the process of coprorhexy is taken into account and, indeed, breakage of large particles by crustacean zooplankton may be an important process in modifying material transport in the ocean. Copepods appear to perform coprorhexy by removing the peritrophic membrane with its attached bacterial flora and this may then be ingested. We speculate on the nutritional value of such a behaviour and the possible significance of “ghost” pellets, consisting of a membrane with little or no apparent solid content.},

  abstract = {Iron is the most important micronutrient in the ocean, but the nature and magnitude of its sources and sinks to the ocean are poorly constrained. Here we assess our understanding of the sources and sinks of iron in margin environments by synthesizing observations from the U.S. GEOTRACES GP16 Eastern Tropical Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT) cruise near the Peru margin. GP16 observations showed elevated dissolved iron (dFe) concentrations along the margin, but a larger westward plume of dFe at slope depths (1000–3000 m) in oxygenated waters, rather than at shelf depths (100–300 m) in oxygen deficient waters. We examine the potential explanations for this unexpected observation. Multiple tracers from GP16 suggest that sediment resuspension was important at slope depths, which would lead to enhanced benthic flux of dFe above what was previously measured. The difference in the apparent persistence and penetration of shelf versus slope plumes of dFe into the interior of the ocean likely results from faster removal rates of the shelf dFe compared to slope dFe. The dFe sourced from the shelf was almost entirely in the dFe(II) form, whereas dFe sourced from the slope was almost entirely in the dFe(III) form. Although benthic dFe(II) diffuses into oxygen deficient overlying waters, there is still oxidation of dFe(II), which precipitates to particulate Fe(III). In contrast, the slope plume appears to persist in a stabilized dFe(III) form. We hypothesize that sediment porewaters with moderate organic carbon delivery to sediments and shallow oxygen penetration are especially good sources of persistent dFe to the water column.},

We have examined the roles that trace metals and CO2 play in the regulation of TWCA1 expression over ranges of concentrations that bracket those encountered in the marine environment. Both steady-state levels of TWCA1 and the kinetics of induction were measured by western analysis. TWCA1 levels correlated well with cellular CA activity levels. TWCA1 was induced at a low CO2 concentration but the level of induction, as determined by western analysis, was dependent on the availability of Zn. Co effectively substituted for Zn in regulating TWCA1 expression and promoting TWCA1 activity. Upon shift from low to high CO2, the concentration of TWCA1 decreased. The expression of TWCA1 is diel cycle regulated, and cellular TWCA1 decreased during the dark phase. These results provide the basis for studying the expression of CA in field populations and, taken together with previous radiolabeling studies, provide strong evidence of in vivo metal substitution of Co for Zn in a CA. Our data also support the conclusion that TWCA1 plays a central role in carbon acquisition in T. weissflogii.},

Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.},

Biomass, production, and respiration of both types of bacteria were estimated using published models. Our results showed that particle-attached bacteria were, on average, twice as large as and contained 1.3 times more nucleic acid than free-living bacteria. Particle-attached bacteria also sank faster than predicted by Stoke's Law, with estimated sinking velocities comparable to those of chlorophyll a biomass and protist cells. Each individual cell of the particle-attached bacterial community had high carbon demand, but their low abundances ({$<$}3\% of total bacterial numbers) resulted in low total carbon demand. Therefore, the main contributors to POC recycling were found to be free-living bacteria using the non-sinking dissolved organic material, which is released from particles due to the hydrolytic activity of particle-attached bacteria.},

Throughout this course students were exposed to all aspects of preparing a formal research paper for publication. The process began with the submission of an abstract and was followed by the preparation of a draft paper for formal review, as well as the preparation of a revised, cameraready copy for publication in the conference proceedings. Students then presented their final papers at an in-class conference held at the end of the semester. A summary of the curriculum devised for this writing technique will be presented. In addition, lessons learned from the initial phase of the study will be shared along with how those lessons were translated into effective changes for the second phase of the study.

This ‘microdiversity,’ or closely related ({$>$} 97\% similar 16S rRNA gene) but ecologically and physiologically distinct sub-taxonomic groups, appears to be an intrinsic property of microorganisms. However, the functional implications of microdiversity as well as its effects on microbial biogeography are poorly understood. Here, we present two theoretical models outlining the evolutionary mechanisms that drive the formation of microdiverse ‘sub-taxa.’ Additionally, we review recent literature and reveal that microdiversity influences a wide range of functional traits across diverse ecosystems and microbes. Moving to higher levels of organization, we use laboratory data from marine, soil, and host-associated bacteria to demonstrate that the aggregated trait-based response of microdiverse sub-taxa modifies the fundamental niche of microbes. The correspondence between microdiversity and niche space represents a critical tool for future studies of microbial ecology. By combining growth experiments on diverse isolates with examinations of environmental abundance patterns, researchers can better quantify the fundamental and realized niches of microbes and improve understanding of microbial biogeography and response to future environmental change.},

  abstract = {Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified. This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters. The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23°C–25~°C than at 4~°C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments. The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water.},

Many aspects of this complexity, from the number of species to the total number of interactions, are currently very difficult to examine directly. However, extraordinary efforts are being made to make these systems accessible to scientific investigation. While recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have improved accessibility to the taxonomic and functional diversity of complex communities, monitoring the dynamics of these systems over time and space using appropriate experimental design is still expensive. Fortunately, modeling can be used as a lens to focus low-resolution observations of community dynamics to enable mathematical abstractions of functional and taxonomic dynamics across space and time. Here, we review the approaches for modeling bacterial diversity at both the very large and the very small scales at which microbial systems interact with their environments. We show that modeling can help to connect biogeochemical processes to specific microbial metabolic pathways.},

  abstract = {Understanding the interactions between the Earth's microbiome and the physical, chemical and biological environment is a fundamental goal of microbial ecology. We describe a bioclimatic modeling approach that leverages artificial neural networks to predict microbial community structure as a function of environmental parameters and microbial interactions. This method was better at predicting observed community structure than were any of several single-species models that do not incorporate biotic interactions. The model was used to interpolate and extrapolate community structure over time with an average Bray-Curtis similarity of 89.7. Additionally, community structure was extrapolated geographically to create the first microbial map derived from single-point observations. This method can be generalized to the many microbial ecosystems for which detailed taxonomic data are currently being generated, providing an observation-based modeling technique for predicting microbial taxonomic structure in ecological studies.

  abstract = {Conventional sensors for the quantification of O2 availability in aquatic environments typically have limits of detection (LOD) of {$>$} 1 μmol L−1 and do not have sufficient resolution to reliably measure concentrations in strongly O2 depleted environments. We present a novel trace optical sensor based on the palladium(II)-benzoporphyrin luminophore, immobilized in a perfluorinated matrix with high O2 permeability. The trace sensor has a detection limit of ∼5 nmol L−1 with a dynamic range extending up to ∼2 μmol L−1. The sensor demonstrates a response time {$<$} 30 s and a small, predictable, and fully reversible response to hydrostatic pressure and temperature. The sensor showed excellent stability for continuously measurements during depth profiling in Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZ). The novel sensor was deployed in situ using a Trace Oxygen Profiler instrument (TOP) equipped with two additional O2 optical sensors, with higher dynamic range, allowing, when combined, measurements of O2 concentration from ∼5 nmol L−1 to 1000 μmol L−1 with a single instrument. The TOP instrument was deployed in the OMZ regions of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) and Bay of Bengal (BoB). The measurements demonstrated that O2 concentrations in the ETNP generally were below the LOD of the trace sensor, but that large sub-micromolar O2 intrusions, spanning 60–80 m with maximum O2 concentrations above 50 nmol L−1, could be observed in the OMZ core. The O2 concentrations in the BoB were high compared to the ETNP and rarely decreased below 50 nmol L−1, but demonstrated tremendous small-scale variability.},

  abstract = {Most studies of spring bloom succession in Norwegian waters have employed light microscopy and accounted for species composition of phyto- and zooplankton. Flow cytometry and molecular tools enable us to extend such investigations to include smaller organisms like bacterio- and virioplankton. Here, we describe succession and diversity of algae, bacteria, and viruses in relation to environmental changes from 15 February to 27 April. The spring succession started with an increase in autotrophic picoeukaryotes and Synechococcus sp. The diatoms bloomed around the middle of March and caused nutrient depletion in the upper part of the water column. Upwelling in the beginning of April gave rise to a second bloom, consisting of diatoms and Phaeocystis pouchetii. Numerically, autotrophic picoeukaryotes and Synechococcus sp. dominated the periods between and after these two major blooms. Heterotrophic bacterial abundance increased throughout the experimental period and reached peak values during and after phytoplankton blooms. These bacteria were succeeded by viruses having low DNA fluorescence, whereas viruses with medium DNA fluorescence bloomed during or after blooms of autotrophic picoeukaryotes. High-DNA fluorescence viruses reached maximum concentrations during and after the diatom and Phaeocystis blooms. The diversity of the bacterial community remained relatively stable, whereas viral diversity varied more and increased after major phytoplankton blooms. Our investigation thus demonstrates how virioplankton are important elements of the total microbial diversity and how they are intimately linked to the rest of the microbial community and possibly act as an internal driving force in spring bloom successions.},

In lakes Ekoln and Valloxen, Microcystis aeruginosa was the dominant cyanobacterium, while the oscillatorian species Planktothrix prolifica form dense blooms in Lake Lilla Ullfjärden. The cyanobacterial composition in Lake Storsjön was more diverse with several Microcystis and Dolichospermum species. All dominant taxa are well-known producers of hepatotoxic MC. The highest recorded MC in the water samples from Lake Lilla Ullfjärden was measured in the bloom of P. prolifica (35 μg L−1). The highest MC content was measured in invertebrates; however, the MC concentration was usually low in fish. Maximum levels were 9 μg g−1 dry weight (dw) in zooplankton, 10 μg g−1 dw in benthos, and 2.7 μg g−1 dw in fish (smelt) liver. In fish muscle the highest recorded levels were 0.10–0.18 μg g−1 dw in bleak and smelt from Lake Lilla Ullfjärden and in pike-perch and roach from Lake Storsjön. Based on the World Health Organization’s tolerable daily intake value of 0.04 μg kg–1 body weight, we conclude that any risk related to MC from human consumption of fish from these lakes is minimal.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing concern for `microplastics'  (particles {$<$} 5 mm) in the marine environment. Since plastics degrade very slowly, they remain in the environment on much longer timescales than most natural substrates and can thus provide a novel habitat for colonization by microbial communities (Zettler et al. 2013 Environ. Sci. Technol. 47:7137). The full spectrum of relationships between microplastics and bacteria, however, is little understood. In summer 2015, we examined microplastics collected from a tributary of the lower Chesapeake Bay and determined the presence, abundance, and antibiotic-resistance profiles of Vibrio spp. found on them. We collected 22 microplastic pieces, paired seawater samples, and from them cultured 44 putative Vibrio spp. isolates, 18 of which were PCR-confirmed as V. parahaemolyticus and 3 as V. vulnificus. There were no PCR-confirmed V. cholerae isolates. We used the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test to examine the isolates' response to six antibiotics: chloramphenicol (30μg), gentamicin (10μg), ampicillin (10μg), streptomycin (10μg), tetracycline (30μg), and rifampin (5μg). Vibrio isolates were susceptible to three or more of the six antibiotics tested and all were susceptible to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. There were no apparent differences between the antibiotic susceptibilities of vibrios isolated from microplastics compared to those from the water column. In every instance tested, vibrios on microplastics were enriched by at least two orders of magnitude compared to those from paired seawater samples. This study demonstrates that microplastic particles serve as a habitat for Vibrio species, in particular V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus, confirming the conjecture of Zettler et al. (2013) that plastics may serve as a vector for these and other potentially pathogenic bacteria.},

We determined the phylogenetic affiliation for the microorganisms growing on aggregates by pyrosequencing partial 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Water column samples were also collected and sequenced for comparison between sinking-particle-associated and planktonic bacterial communities. Statistically significant differences were found between the water column and sediment trap bacteria. Relative abundances of Pelagibacter sp. and multiple members of the Flavobacteria, Actinobacteria, and α-Proteobacteria were elevated in water column samples, while trap samples contained members of the Roseobacter clade of α-Proteobacteria in high relative abundances. Our findings indicated that rapid changes – within 24~h of collection – occurred to the microbial community associated with aggregates from either bloom type. There was a little change in the bacterial assemblage after the initial 24-h incubation period. The most abundant early colonizer was a Sulfitobacter sp. This study provides further evidence that Roseobacters are rapid colonizers of marine aggregates and that colonization can occur on short timescales. This study further demonstrates that particle origin may be insignificant regarding the heterotrophic bacterial population that degrades them.},

  abstract = {Transformations of plant-derived carbon into soil organic carbon (SOC) influences both local and global carbon cycles. Soil bacteria play a major role in SOC transformations, which are important for maintaining soil fertility and for stabilizing carbon in soil. SOC is consumed by bacteria in soil and transformed into biomass or respired to carbon dioxide. This bacterial-driven partitioning of SOC is defined as Bacterial Growth Efficiency (BGE) and it is an integral component of models that simulate carbon dynamics. We tested the variability of BGE in microbial communities from soil by measuring bacterial production (BP) and respiration (BR), the two components of BGE, in slurries of soils collected from deciduous forests and croplands at the Kellogg Biological Station Long Term Ecological Research site. BP was measured as 3H-leucine incorporation into protein and BR as oxygen consumption. The differences in BP and BR in soil under different land management practices revealed that BGE was not static but varied from 0.23 to 0.63, supporting more recent SOC models. Bacterial communities from soils of soybean monoculture cropland tended to have a higher BGE than those from deciduous forests. BGE of cropland soil microbes exhibited a large seasonal variation not observed in forest soils. Nutrient amendments on rotation cropland soil microcosms showed that BGE is sensitive to substrate availability and nutrient stoichiometry. Using a range of growth efficiency expected of terrestrial ecosystem, simulations of carbon dynamics in a forest using the DAYCENT model revealed the sensitivity of equilibrium soil carbon values to changes in growth efficiency. Decreasing the default growth efficiency of 0.45 to a growth efficiency of 0.35 reduced the active carbon fraction by 22\%. This sensitivity emphasizes the importance of site-specific BGE measurements for improving the predictive capacity of SOC models, especially when investigating the effects of changes in land management practices on labile SOC transformation. The weak correlation of BP and BR in most soil tested also showed that BGE is a more valuable measurement than the common interpretation of bacterial activity based on BR.},

Here we demonstrate the critical influence of climate variability, interacting with accumulated nitrogen (N) over multidecades, on Susquehanna River dissolved nitrogen (DN) loads, known precursors of the hypoxia in the Bay. We used the process model LM3-TAN (Terrestrial and Aquatic Nitrogen), which is capable of capturing both seasonal and decadal-to-century changes in vegetation-soil-river N storage, and produced nine scenarios of DN-load distributions under different short-term scenarios of climate variability and extremes. We illustrate that after 1 to 3 yearlong dry spells, the likelihood of exceeding a threshold DN load (56 kt yrÀ1) increases by 40 to 65\% due to flushing of N accumulated throughout the dry spells and altered microbial processes. Our analyses suggest that possible future increases in climate variability/extremes—specifically, high precipitation occurring after multiyear dry spells—could likely lead to high DN-load anomalies and hypoxia.},

  abstract = {In an effort to identify the key mechanisms controlling biological productivity and food web structure in the Chesapeake Bay estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM), we measured plankton community metabolism on a series of surveys in the upper Chesapeake Bay during the winter and spring of 2007 and 2008. Measured quantities included primary production, bacterial production, planktonic community respiration, and algal pigment concentrations. These measurements revealed a classic minimum in photosynthesis in the vicinity of the ETM. Temporal variability in plankton community metabolism, primary production, respiration, and bacterial production were highest in the southern oligohaline region down-estuary of the ETM and appeared to be driven by dynamic bio-physical interactions. Elevated primary production and community respiration in this region were often associated with the presence of mixotrophic dinoflagellates. The dinoflagellate contribution to primary production and respiration appeared to be particularly large as a result of their mixotrophic capabilities, which allow them to obtain energy both autotrophically and heterotrophically. The present study suggests that mixotrophic dinoflagellates play a key role in the pelagic food web in the oligohaline region of Chesapeake Bay, supplying most of the labile organic matter during late winter and spring and also providing a vector for transferring microbial production to mesozooplankton.},

  abstract = {Gradients of dissolved oxygen concentrations in seasonally stratified estuarine water columns directly influence microbial composition and metabolic pathways, resulting in annually recurring spatiotemporal chemical gradients of redox-active species. Understanding such microbial responses to variable geochemical conditions and elucidating the diversity of microbial processes are needed to comprehensively identify ecosystem functions. At first this study describes an investigation of the relationships between microbial processes and geochemical conditions. To assess the contribution of different biological redox processes on carbon and nitrogen cycles in the Chesapeake Bay, we used observational and experimental approaches as well as utilization of monitoring datasets to facilitate an assessment of ecosystem-level metabolism. Observations revealed a general positive association of community metabolism with strong gradients of redox-related variables and hydrodynamic characteristics, although geochemical and environmental conditions varied seasonally across oxic transitions and interannually across degrees of stratification. The most distinct evidence supporting the positive association were vertical distributions of community respiration with the highest average rates in the most stratified regions coincident with the depths of the steepest gradient of chemical compounds. Although organic matter availability may be enhanced due to hydrodynamically induced stability, our investigation of factors driving the pattern revealed that differential responses and metabolic strategies of microbial communities result in high respiration near oxyclines. Investigation of vertical profiles of redox-related variables also revealed that the coexistence of oxidants and reduced compounds further provides an optimal condition for other electron accepting processes, including chemoautotrophy and anoxygenic photoautotrophy. The strong interdependence between environmental conditions and variability in microbial metabolism also reflected in patterns of plankton assemblages. An ammonium mass-balance analysis revealed that increases in vertical ammonium dispersion during severe hypoxia cause a shift of plankton assemblages towards heterotrophy, subsequently supporting a deep secondary microbial food web in the vicinity of oxic/anoxic interface. Overall, results from this research indicate that the estimation of more accurate net ecosystem metabolism should take into consideration of the highly variable nature of community metabolism associated with both geochemical gradients and stratification.},

  abstract = {Prompted by recent data analyses suggesting that the flux of particulate organic carbon sinking into deep waters is determined by fluxes of mineral ballasts, we undertook a study of the relationships among organic matter (OM), calcium carbonate, opal, lithogenic material, and excess aluminum fluxes as part of the MedFlux project. We measured fluxes of particulate components during Spring and Summer of 2003, and Spring of 2005, using a swimmer-excluding sediment trap design capable of measuring fluxes both in a time-series (TS) mode and in a configuration for obtaining particle settling velocity (SV) profiles. On the basis of these studies, we suggest that distinct OM–ballast associations observed in particles sinking at a depth of ∼200 m imply that the mechanistic basis of the organic matter–ballast association is set in the upper water column above the Twilight Zone, and that the importance of different ballast types follows the seasonal succession of phytoplankton. As in other studies, carbonate appears to enhance the flux of organic matter over opal. Particles must be at least half organic matter before their settling velocity is affected by ballast concentration. This lack of change in ballast composition with SV in particles with \&lt;40\% OM content suggests that particle SV reaches a maximum because of the increasing importance of inertial drag. Relative amounts of OM and opal decrease with depth due to decomposition and dissolution; carbonates and lithogenic material contribute about the same amount to total mass, or increase slightly, throughout the water column. The high proportion of excess Al cannot be explained by its incorporation into diatom opal or reverse weathering, so Al is most likely adsorbed to particulate oxides. On shorter time scales, dust appears to increase particle flux through its role in aggregation rather than by nutrient inputs enhancing productivity. We suggest that the role of dust as a catalyst in particle formation may be a central mechanism in flux formation in this region, particularly when zooplankton fecal pellet production is low.},

  abstract = {Fractal dimension analysis using an optical imaging analysis technique is a powerful tool in obtaining morphological information of particulate aggregates formed in coagulation processes. However, as image analysis uses two-dimensional projected images of the aggregates, it is only applicable to one and two-dimensional fractal analyses. In this study, three-dimensional fractal dimensions are estimated from image analysis by characterizing relationships between three-dimensional fractal dimensions (D3) and one (D1) and two-dimensional fractal dimensions (D2 and Dpf). The characterization of these fractal dimensions were achieved by creating populations of aggregates based on the pre-defined radius of gyration while varying the number of primary particles in an aggregate and three-dimensional fractal dimensions. Approximately 2000 simulated aggregates were grouped into 33 populations based on the radius of gyration of each aggregate class. Each population included from 15 to 115 aggregates and the number of primary particles in an aggregate varied from 10 to 1000. Characterization of the fractal dimensions demonstrated that the one-dimensional fractal dimensions could not be used to estimate two- and three-dimensional fractal dimensions. However, two-dimensional fractal dimensions obtained statistically, well-characterized relationships with aggregates of a three-dimensional fractal characterization. Three-dimensional fractal dimensions obtained in this study were compared with previously published experimental values where both two-dimensional fractal and three-dimensional fractal data were given. In the case of inorganic aggregates, when experimentally obtained three-dimensional fractal dimensions were 1.75, 1.86, 1.83±0.07, 2.24±0.22, and 1.72±0.13, computed three-dimensional fractal dimensions using two-dimensional fractal dimensions were 1.75, 1.76, 1.77±0.04, 2.11±0.09, and 1.76±0.03, respectively. However, when primary particles were biological colloids, experimentally obtained three-dimensional fractal dimensions were 1.99±0.08 and 2.14±0.04, and computed values were both 1.79±0.08. Analysis of the three-dimensional fractal dimensions with the imaging analysis technique was comparable to the conventional methods of both light scattering and electrical sensing when primary particles are inorganic colloids.},

  abstract = {Microscopic estimation of bacterial biomass requires determination of both biovolume and biovolume-to-biomass conversion. Both steps have uncertainty when applied to the very small bacteria typically found in natural seawater. In the present study, natural bacterioplankton assemblages were freshly collected, passed through 0.6-μm-pore-size Nuclepore filters to remove larger particulate materials, and diluted for growth in 0.22-μm-pore-size Millipore filter-sterilized unenriched seawater. This provided cells comparable in size and morphology to those in natural seawater, but the cultures were free of the interfering particulate detritus naturally present. Cells were collected on glass-fiber GF/F filters, and biovolumes were corrected for cells passing these filters; C and N were measured with a CHN analyzer. Our criteria for size measurement by epifluorescence photomicrography were confirmed with fluorescent microspheres of known diameters. Surprisingly, in six cultures with average per-cell biovolumes ranging from 0.036 to 0.073 μm3, the average per-cell carbon biomass was relatively constant at 20 ± 0.08 fg of C (mean ± standard error of the mean). The biovolume-to-biomass conversion factor averaged 0.38 ± 0.05 g of C cm−3, which is about three times higher than the value previously estimated from Escherichia coli, and decreased with increasing cell volume. The C:N ratio was 3.7 ± 0.2. We conclude that natural marine bacterial biomass and production may be higher than was previously thought and that variations in bacterial size may not reflect variations in biomass per cell.},

  abstract = {Domoic acid is a potent neurotoxin that is naturally produced by several diatom species of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. The toxin acts as a glutamate agonist and is excitotoxic in the vertebrate central nervous system and other glutamate receptor-rich organs. Human exposure to domoic acid occurs via the consumption of contaminated shellfish that have accumulated the toxin while filter feeding on toxigenic phytoplankton during blooms. The first reported human domoic acid poisoning event occurred in Canada in 1987 during which clinical signs of acute toxicity such as gastrointestinal distress, confusion, disorientation, memory loss, coma and death were observed. The illness was named amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) and due to effective seafood monitoring programs there have been no documented ASP cases since 1987. However, domoic acid poisoning has a significant effect on marine wildlife and multiple poisoning events have occurred in marine birds and mammals over the last few decades. Currently, domoic acid producing diatom blooms are thought to be increasing in frequency world wide, posing an increasing threat to wildlife and human health. Of particular concern are the potential impacts of long-term low-level exposure in “at risk” human populations. The impacts of repetitive low-level domoic acid exposure are currently unknown. This review provides a basic description of the mechanism of action of domoic acid as well as a synthesis of information pertaining to domoic acid exposure routes, toxin susceptibility, and the importance of effective monitoring programs. The importance of investigating the potential human health impacts of long-term low-level domoic acid exposure in “at risk” human populations is also discussed.},

The technique will allow researchers to base analyses on measures of association (distance measures) that are ecologically relevant. In addition, unlike other distance-based hypothesis-testing techniques, this method allows tests of significance of interaction terms in a linear model. The technique uses the existing method of redundancy analysis (RDA) but allows the analysis to be based on Bray-Curtis or other ecologically meaningful measures through the use of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Steps in the procedure include: (1) calculating a matrix of distances among replicates using a distance measure of choice (e.g., Bray-Curtis); (2) determining the principal coordinates (including a correction for negative eigenvalues, if necessary), which preserve these distances; (3) creating a matrix of dummy variables corresponding to the design of the experiment (i.e., individual terms in a linear model); (4) analyzing the relationship between the principal coordinates (species data) and the dummy variables (model) using RDA; and (5) implementing a test by permutation for particular statistics corresponding to the particular terms in the model. This method has certain advantages not shared by other multivariate testing procedures. We demonstrate the use of this technique with experimental ecological data from intertidal assemblages and show how the presence of significant multivariate interactions can be interpreted. It is our view that distance-based RDA will be extremely useful to ecologists measuring multispecies responses to structured multifactorial experimental designs.},

Other cyanobacteria toxins were absent or only present in trace amounts. The composition of the microcystins among stations was similar and dominated by demethyl microcystin-LR followed by microcystin-LR. In situ toxicity computed for the {$>$}75 μm cell diameter size fraction was well below the 1 μg l−1 advisory level set by the World Health Organization for water quality, but the toxicity of the full population is unknown. The toxicity may have been greater earlier in the year when biomass was visibly higher. Toxicity was highest at low water temperature, water transparency and salinity. Microcystins from the bloom entered the food web and were present in both total zooplankton and clam tissue. Initial laboratory feeding tests suggested the cyanobacteria was not consumed by the adult copepod Eurytemora affinis, an important fishery food source in the estuary.},

It was hypothesized that the seasonal variation in Microcystis cell density and microcystin concentration was ecologically important because it could influence the transfer of toxic microcystins into the aquatic food web. Sampling for Microcystis cell density, chl a concentration, total microcystins concentration and a suite of environmental conditions was conducted biweekly at nine stations throughout the freshwater tidal and brackish water regions of the estuary between July and November 2004. Total microcystins in zooplankton and clam tissue was also sampled in August and October. Microcystis cell density, chl a concentration and total microcystins concentration varied by an order of magnitude and peaked during August and September when \textbackslash ( \{\textbackslash text\{P\}\}\^\{\{\textbackslash text\{B\}\}\}\_\{\{\textbackslash text\{m\}\}\} \textbackslash ) and αB were high. Low streamflow and high water temperature were strongly correlated with the seasonal variation of Microcystis cell density, total microcystins concentration (cell)−1 and total microcystins concentration (chl a)−1 in canonical correlation analyses. Nutrient concentrations and ratios were of secondary importance in the analysis and may be of lesser importance to seasonal variation of the bloom in this nutrient rich estuary. The seasonal variation of Microcystis density and biomass was potentially important for the structure and function of the estuarine aquatic food web, because total microcystins concentration was high at the base of the food web in mesozooplankton, amphipod, clam, and worm tissue during the peak of the bloom.},

  abstract = {The impact of the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa on estuarine food web production in San Francisco Estuary is unknown. It is hypothesized that Microcystis contributed to a recent decline in pelagic organisms directly through its toxicity or indirectly through its impact on the food web after 1999. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, zooplankton, and fish were collected biweekly at stations throughout the estuary in 2005. Concentrations of the tumor-promoting Microcystis toxin, microcystin, were measured in water, plankton, zooplankton, and fish by a protein phosphatase inhibition assay, and fish health was assessed by histopathology. Microcystis abundance was elevated in the surface layer of the western and central delta and reached a maximum of 32 × 109 cells l−1 at Old River in August. Its distribution across the estuary was correlated with a suite of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria species in the surface layer and 1 m depth including Aphanizomenon spp., Aulacoseira granulata, Bacillaria paradoxa, Rhodomonas spp., and Cryptomonas spp. Shifts in the phytoplankton community composition coincided with a decrease in the percentage of diatom and green algal carbon and increase in the percentage of cryptophyte carbon at 1 m depth. Maximum calanoid and cyclopoid copepod carbon coincided with elevated Microcystis abundance, but it was accompanied by a low cladocera to calanoid copepod ratio. Total microcystins were present at all levels of the food web and the greater total microcystins concentration in striped bass than their prey suggested toxins accumulated at higher trophic levels. Histopathology of fish liver tissue suggested the health of two common fish in the estuary, striped bass (Morone saxatilis), and Mississippi silversides (Menidia audens), was impacted by tumor-promoting substances, particularly at stations where total microcystins concentration was elevated. This study suggests that even at low abundance, Microcystis may impact estuarine fishery production through toxic and food web impacts at multiple trophic levels.},

  abstract = {Routine monitoring of shellfish growing waters for bacteria indicative of human sewage pollution reveals little about the bacterial communities that co-occur with these indicators. This study investigated the bacterial community, potential pathogens, and fecal indicator bacteria in 40 water samples from a shellfish growing area in the Chesapeake Bay, USA. Bacterial community composition was quantified with deep sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, and absolute gene abundances were estimated with an internal standard (Thermus thermophilus genomes). Fecal coliforms were quantified by culture, and Vibrio vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus with quantitative PCR. Fecal coliforms and V. vulnificus were detected in most samples, and a diverse assemblage of potential human pathogens in all samples. These taxa followed two general patterns of abundance. Fecal coliforms and 16S rRNA genes for Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas, Arcobacter, Staphylococcus and Bacteroides increased in abundance after a 1.3-inch rain event in May, and, for some taxa, after smaller rain events later in the season, suggesting that these are allochthonous organisms washed in from land. Clostridiales and Mycobacterium 16S rRNA gene abundances increased with temperature and were unrelated to rainfall, suggesting that these are autochthonous organisms. Other groups followed both patterns, including Vibrio and Legionella. Fecal coliform abundance did not correlate with any other taxa, but were extremely high following the large rainstorm in May when they co-occurred with a broad range of potential pathogens. V. vulnificus were absent during the large rainstorm, and did not correlate with 16S rRNA abundances of Vibrio spp. or any other taxa. These results highlight the complex nature of bacterial communities and the limited utility of using specific bacterial groups as indicators of pathogen presence.},

  abstract = {Coastal states of the United States (US) routinely monitor shellfish harvest waters for types of bacteria that indicate the potential presence of fecal pollution. The densities of these indicator bacteria in natural waters may be related to climate in several ways, including through runoff from precipitation and survival related to water temperatures. The relationship between interannual precipitation and air temperature patterns and the densities of fecal indicator bacteria in shellfish harvest waters in Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay was quantified using 34 years of data (1979–2013). Annual and seasonal precipitation totals had a strong positive relationship with average fecal coliform levels (R2~=~0.69) and the proportion of samples with bacterial densities above the FDA regulatory criteria (R2~=~0.77). Fecal coliform levels were also significantly and negatively related to average annual air temperature (R2~=~−0.43) and the average air temperature of the warmest month (R2~=~−0.57), while average seasonal air temperature was only significantly related to fecal coliform levels in the summer. River and regional fecal coliform levels displayed a wide range of relationships with precipitation and air temperature patterns, with stronger relationships in rural areas and mainstem Bay stations. Fecal coliform levels tended to be higher in years when the bulk of precipitation occurred throughout the summer and/or fall (August to September). Fecal coliform levels often peaked in late fall and winter, with precipitation peaking in summer and early fall. Continental-scale sea level pressure (SLP) analysis revealed an association between atmospheric patterns that influence both extratropical and tropical storm tracks and very high fecal coliform years, while regional precipitation was found to be significantly correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Pacific North American Pattern. These findings indicate that management of shellfish harvest waters should account for changes in climate conditions and that SLP patterns may be particularly important for predicting years with extremely high levels of fecal coliforms.},

  abstract = {Many coastal states of the United States restrict harvest of shellfish from select areas based on some environmental trigger. Such areas are classified as being conditionally approved. In Maryland, the trigger is an inch or more of rainfall that has fallen in the last 24 h. This study used 11 years of monitoring data to test the relationship between daily rainfall totals and densities of fecal indicators in Maryland shellfish harvest waters. Precipitation and fecal coliform (FC) water monitoring data from 2004 to 2014 were matched by date and watershed. The influence of antecedent rainfall conditions (i.e. rainfall in the preceding days or weeks) and the distance of each monitoring station to land were compared to the percent of samples exceeding the FDA criterion for managing shellfish harvest areas. Sample stations beyond 1000m from land had FC densities consistently below the FDA criterion and were excluded from further analysis. Rainfall events greater than an inch tended to result in significantly elevated FC for the following two days, followed by lower levels thereafter. The total amount of rain in the last three weeks was positively related to the proportion of samples with FC greater than the FDA criterion. Bay-wide, the percent of samples exceeding the FDA criterion rose from seven percent for rainfall less than an inch to 37\% following one or more inches of rain. Watersheds were classified based on the percent of FC densities over the criterion when rainfall was an inch or more, with 41 of 81 watersheds showing FC responses indicative of potential conditionally approved areas, those shellfish growing areas where the one inch precipitation trigger may be applied. These areas largely overlapped the current conditionally approved areas defined by Maryland. The percent of open water, wetlands, and poorly drained soils explained a significant amount of the variability (R2 = 0.72) in the difference in percent of samples exceeding the FDA criterion when rainfall was greater than an inch and when it was less than an inch. Logistic regression analysis showed that the current trigger of one inch of rain in 24 h is predictive of FC densities over the FDA criterion, though the appropriate threshold will most likely depend on how far the particular shellfish growing area is from land and antecedent rain conditions. In watersheds with relatively high percentages of open water to total watershed size, higher rainfall thresholds might be appropriate. The approach taken in this study could be applied to individual stations and sub-watersheds, potentially allowing the reclassification of some shellfish harvest areas.},

  abstract = {Correlations between particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral fluxes in the deep ocean have inspired the inclusion of “ballast effect” parameterizations in carbon cycle models. A recent study demonstrated regional variability in the effect of ballast minerals on the flux of POC in the deep ocean. We have undertaken a similar analysis of shallow export data from the Arctic, Atlantic, and Southern Oceans. Mineral ballasting is of greatest importance in the high-latitude North Atlantic, where 60\% of the POC flux is associated with ballast minerals. This fraction drops to around 40\% in the Southern Ocean. The remainder of the export flux is not associated with minerals, and this unballasted fraction thus often dominates the export flux. The proportion of mineral-associated POC flux often scales with regional variation in export efficiency (the proportion of primary production that is exported). However, local discrepancies suggest that regional differences in ecology also impact the magnitude of surface export. We propose that POC export will not respond equally across all high-latitude regions to possible future changes in ballast availability.},

Of all peer-reviewed papers published during 2009 in the field's leading journals, slightly more than 70\% lacked replication when it came to analyzing microbial community data. The paucity of replication is viewed as an ‘endemic’ and ‘embarrassing’ problem that amounts to ‘bad science’, or worse yet, as the title suggests, lying (Prosser, 2010). Although replication is an important component of experimental design, it is possible to do good science without replication. There are various quantitative techniques – some old, some new – that, when used properly, will allow environmental microbiologists to make strong statistical conclusions from experimental and comparative data. Here, I provide examples where unreplicated data can be used to test hypotheses and yield novel information in a statistically robust manner.},

  abstract = {The Amazon River discharge forms a plume of low-salinity water that extends offshore and northwestward over the north Brazilian shelf. Observations acquired as part of A Multidisciplinary Amazon Shelf SEDiment Study (AMASSEDS) are used to characterize the spatial structure and temporal variability of the Amazon Plume. Four shipboard conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) surveys spanning the shelf from 1 degrees S to 5 degrees N during rising (March 1990), maximum (May 1990), falling (August 1989), and minimum (November 1991) discharge show the Amazon Plume is typically 3 to 10 m thick and 80 to over 200 km wide. Northwest of the river mouth, the plume is often characterized by a wedge of low-salinity water adjacent to the coast and a separate tongue of low-salinity water extending offshore over the middle to outer shelf. A bottom front separating the low-salinity plume water from oceanic water is consistently located between the 10- and 20-m isobaths. A moored array deployed about 300 km northwest of the river mouth from February to June 1990 included inner and midshelf moorings in 18 and 65 m of water on which temperature-conductivity measurements were made. The moored observations reveal salinity variations within the Amazon Plume of over 10 psu on timescales of days to weeks. This variability includes intermittent events in which plume water pools up in the vicinity of the river mouth and the plume width can exceed 200 km. These accumulation events are apparently due to wind events with a southeastward component which impede or block the normally northwestward freshwater transport. The resulting bulges in the plume are then released northwestward when the wind reverses. Volume budgets indicate the Amazon Plume entrains roughly twice the river discharge between the river mouth at the equator and 3 degrees N. Estimates of gradient Richardson numbers from the moorings suggest entrainment, due to the strong semidiurnal tidal currents, occurs where the plume intersects the bottom and over the outer portion of the plume, where salinities approach oceanic values.},

  abstract = {Seasonal variations of dissolved NH4+ , NO3− , NO2− and Si(OH)4 within an oyster bed sediment from the Bay of Morlaix, Brittany, France, were studied from February 1985 to January 1986. They were compared to the annual pattern of sedimentary organic C and N. Nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface were measured using sediment cores and compared to those estimated from solute gradients between pore water and the water column. Organic matter showed three accumulation periods. The highest one occurred during summer. Humic compounds analysis confirmed a marine origin (seaweeds, oyster feces) while they displayed a terrigenous origin in January and April. Vertical profiles of organic matter are characteristic for a strong burial activity. One example of this activity is described through the good correlation which is found between the organic C : N ratios at 1 and 10 cm. Gradients of ammonium and nitrate between the first centimetre of the sediment and the water column ranged from 36.6 to 202.4 and from − 15.2 to 130.2 μmol · 1−1 · cm −1. For nitrite and silicate, they ranged from 0.8 to 9.2 and from - 3.6 to 152.4 μmol · 1−1 · cm −1. Whatever the organic matter source was, the degradation pattern in the sediment followed the same processes. Sedimentary organic matter was oxidized to NH4+ which was partially transformed to NO2−. NO3− production occurred only during spring when redox conditions were appropriate. Pore water NO3− profiles were greatly influenced by endofauna activity. These oxidation processes appeared slower than in the water column but organic and nutrient concentrations encountered were generally much higher. Molecular diffusion calculated from vertical pore water concentration gradients could not entirely explain fluxes observed throughout the year. The annual pattern of the exchanges of the remineralized compounds Si(OH)4, NH4+ , NO3− and NO2− at the sediment-water interface was studied under laboratory conditions using a core incubation method. These nutrient fluxes ranged over the year from − 24.8 to 47.7 μmol · m −2 · h −1 for ammonium, from − 15.6 to 94.1 μmol · m−2 · h −1 for nitrate, from − 10. to 9.3 μmol · m −2 · h −1 for nitrite and from −18.9 to 94.5 μmol · m−2 · h−1 for silicate. The annual variations of nitrate and nitrite fluxes have been found to be well correlated with the C : N ratio of the organic matter within the first centimetre of the sediment.

ALOHA (22-degrees-45'N, 158-degrees-00'W) bet-en February 1989 and October 1991 to document the variability in phytoplankton abundance and composition. The annual mean depth-integrated (0-200 db) concentration of Chl a displayed significant interannual variability. Seasonal patterns in Chl a concentration were found to be depth-dependent. Elevated Chl a in the mixed layer is the result of photoadaptation as the mixed layer deepens in winter. Increases in Chl a at the deep chlorophyll maximum layer (DCML) in spring are explained by increased nutrient availability caused by a deepening of the DCML relative to the sigma(theta) = 24.25 density surface. An algorithm based on the ratios of Chl a to diagnostic pigments present in specific algal taxa was used to estimate the contribution to total Chl a by the major algal groups represented within the DCML. Results indicate the presence of a phytoplankton community at the DCML with the following mean composition: Prochlorococcus spp. (39\%), cyanobacteria (24\%), prymnesiophytes (22\%),and chrysophytes (13\%). No single taxon is responsible for the springtime increase in Chl a observed in this habitat. Results from size fractionation and normal-phase high performance liquid chromatography confirm that Prochlorococcus spp. are the principal contributors of Chl a to the DCML.},

  abstract = {Invasions by nonindigenous species impose large environmental and economic costs. In order to prevent invasions and target monitoring efforts most effectively, we need to forecast locations at the greatest risk of new invasions. To accomplish this, we need to estimate propagule pressure (inoculum size) and consider population processes, including possible Allee effects. Here, we develop a method to estimate the probability of population establishment, based on survival analysis and maximum likelihood techniques. We demonstrate theoretically the validity of this approach, considering environmental heterogeneity, estimation error, and nonlinearity. We then apply this method to zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasions of Michigan inland lakes. We fit our model using presence/absence data for 1589 lakes between 1992 and 1996 and propagule pressure estimates from gravity models of boater traffic. Using our fitted model, we estimated the probabilities of establishment and demonstrated that Allee effects were present in the zebra mussel system. We validated our model using invasion data from 1997–2001 (data not used to parameterize the model). For the validation time period, we correctly predicted up to nine times as many invasions as a null (random) model. Further, the Allee model assigned average probabilities of invasion four times higher for lakes that became invaded than for uninvaded lakes, whereas the non-Allee model predicted probabilities for invaded lakes only two times higher. Thus, our model demonstrates the importance of considering the Allee effect and improves predictions of invasions.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Earth System Models predict a 10\&ndash;20\&thinsp;\% decrease in ocean carbon export production by the end of the 21st century due to global climate change. This decline is caused by increased stratification of the upper ocean, resulting in reduced shallow subsurface nutrient concentrations and a slower supply of nutrients to the surface euphotic zone. These predictions, however, do not account for associated changes in sinking particle size and remineralization depth. Here we combine satellite-derived export and particle size maps with a simple 3-D global biogeochemical model to investigate how shifts in sinking particle size may buffer predicted changes in surface nutrient supply and therefore export production. We show that higher export rates are correlated with larger phytoplankton and sinking particles, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Incorporation of these empirical relationships into a global model shows that as circulation slows, a decrease in export and associated shift toward smaller phytoplankton yields particles that sink more slowly and are thus remineralized shallower; this in turn leads to greater recycling of nutrients in the upper water column and faster nutrient recirculation into the euphotic zone, boosting productivity and export to counteract the initial circulation-driven decreases. This negative feedback mechanism (termed the particle size-remineralization feedback) slows export decline over the next century by \textasciitilde 14\&thinsp;\% globally and by \textasciitilde 20\&thinsp;\% in the tropical and subtropical oceans, where export decreases are currently predicted to be greatest. Thus, incorporating dynamic particle size-dependent remineralization depths into Earth System Models will result in more robust predictions of changes in biological pump strength in a warming climate.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Permanent hypoxia occurs naturally in some isolated seas and marine basins as well as in open slope oxygen minimum zones. Responses of benthos to hypoxia depend on the duration, predictability, and intensity of oxygen depletion and on whether H2S is formed. Under suboxic conditions, large mats of filamentous sulfide oxidizing bacteria cover the seabed and consume sulfide. They are hypothesized to provide a detoxified microhabitat for eukaryotic benthic communities. Calcareous foraminiferans and nematodes are particularly tolerant of low oxygen concentrations and may attain high densities and dominance, often in association with microbial mats. When oxygen is sufficient to support metazoans, small, soft-bodied invertebrates (typically annelids), often with short generation times and elaborate branchial structures, predominate. Large taxa are more sensitive than small taxa to hypoxia. Crustaceans and echinoderms are typically more sensitive to hypoxia, with lower oxygen thresholds, than annelids, sipunculans, molluscs and cnidarians.},

The procedure utilizes a highly selective and somewhat differential primary isolation medium followed by an in situ substrate test for identifying colonies of those organisms capable of hydrolyzing esculin. The procedure (mE) was evaluated with known streptococci strains and field samples with regard to its accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, specificity, precision, and comparability to existing methods. Essentially quantitative recovery was obtained with seawater-stressed cells of Streptococcus faecalis and S. faccium. Neither S. bovis, S. equinus, S. mitis, nor S. salivarius grew on the medium. The selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was incubated at 35 C. About 90\% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci confirmed as such and about 12\% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact, identified as enterococci. Plate to plate variability across samples approximated that expected by chance alone. Verified recoveries of enterococci from natural samples by the mE procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the KF method by one order of magnitude.},

But these variations are not well documented as synoptic taxonomic data are difficult to acquire. Here, we examine how phytoplankton assemblage and diversity vary between mesoscale eddies and submesoscale fronts. We use a multi-phytoplankton numerical model embedded in a mesoscale flow representative of the North Atlantic. Our model results suggest that the mesoscale flow dynamically distorts the niches predefined by environmental contrasts at the basin scale and that the phytoplankton diversity landscape varies over temporal and spatial scales that are one order of magnitude smaller than those of the basin-scale environmental conditions. We find that any assemblage and any level of diversity can occur in eddies and fronts. However, on a statistical level, the results suggest a tendency for larger diversity and more fast-growing types at fronts, where nutrient supplies are larger and where populations of adjacent water masses are constantly brought into contact; and lower diversity in the core of eddies, where water masses are kept isolated long enough to enable competitive exclusion.},

Here we describe different jellyfish data sets produced within the EU programme EURO-BASIN. These data were assembled with the aim of creating an improved baseline and providing new data that can be used to evaluate the current diversity and standing stocks of jellyfish in the North Atlantic region. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Using a net adapted to sample gelatinous zooplankton quantitatively, cnidarians and ctenophores were collected from the epipelagic layer during spring–summer 2010–2013, in inshore and offshore waters between lat 59 and 68° N and long 62° W and 5° E. Jellyfish were also identified and counted in samples opportunistically collected by other sampling equipment in the same region and at two coastal stations in the Bay of Biscay and in the Gulf of Cádiz. Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) samples collected in 2009–2012 were re-analysed with the aim of identifying the time and location of cnidarian blooms across the North Atlantic Basin. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Overall the data show high variability in jellyfish abundance and diversity, mainly in relation to different water masses and bathymetry. Higher densities were generally recorded on the shelves, where the communities tend to be more diverse due to the presence of meropelagic medusae. Comparison of net records from the \emph{G.O. Sars} transatlantic cruise shows that information on jellyfish diversity differs significantly depending on the sampling gear utilised. Indeed, the big trawls mostly collect relatively large scyphozoan and hydrozoan species, while small hydrozoans and early stages of Ctenophora are only caught by smaller nets. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Based on CPR data from 2009 to 2012, blooms of cnidarians occurred in all seasons across the whole North Atlantic Basin. Molecular analysis revealed that, contrary to previous hypotheses, the CPR is able to detect blooms of meroplanktonic and holoplanktonic hydrozoans and scyphozoans. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Through combination of different types of data, key jellyfish taxa for the spring–summer period were identified in the northern North Atlantic regions.

At the transcript level, enhanced triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis under N- conditions primarily involved upregulation of seven putative diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) genes and downregulation of six other DGAT genes, with a simultaneous elevation of the other Kennedy pathway genes. Under N- conditions, despite downregulation of most de novo fatty acid synthesis genes, the pathways that shunt carbon precursors from protein and carbohydrate metabolic pathways into glycerolipid synthesis were stimulated at the transcript level. In particular, the genes involved in supplying carbon precursors and energy for de novo fatty acid synthesis, including those encoding components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), glycolysis, and PDHC bypass, and suites of specific transporters, were substantially upregulated under N- conditions, resulting in increased overall TAG production. Moreover, genes involved in the citric acid cycle and β-oxidation in mitochondria were greatly enhanced to utilize the carbon skeletons derived from membrane lipids and proteins to produce additional TAG or its precursors. This temporal and spatial regulation model of oil accumulation in microalgae provides a basis for improving our understanding of TAG synthesis in microalgae and will also enable more rational genetic engineering of TAG production.},

  abstract = {The sinking of particulate organic carbon (POC) is a key component of the ocean carbon cycle and plays an important role in the global climate system. However, the processes controlling the fraction of primary production that is exported from the euphotic zone (export ratio) and how much of it survives respiration in the mesopelagic to be sequestered in the deep ocean (transfer efficiency) are not well understood. In this study, we use a three-dimensional, coupled physical–biogeochemical model (CCSM–BEC; Community Climate System Model–ocean Biogeochemical Elemental Cycle) to investigate the processes controlling the export of particulate organic matter from the euphotic zone and its flux to depth. We also compare model results with sediment trap data and other parameterizations of POC flux to depth to evaluate model skill and gain further insight into the causes of error and uncertainty in POC flux estimates. In the model, export ratios are mainly a function of diatom relative abundance and temperature while absolute fluxes and transfer efficiency are driven by mineral ballast composition of sinking material. The temperature dependence of the POC remineralization length scale is modulated by denitrification under low O2 concentrations and lithogenic (dust) fluxes. Lithogenic material is an important control of transfer efficiency in the model, but its effect is restricted to regions of strong atmospheric dust deposition. In the remaining regions, CaCO3 content of exported material is the main factor affecting transfer efficiency. The fact that mineral ballast composition is inextricably linked to plankton community structure results in correlations between export ratios and ballast minerals fluxes (opal and CaCO3), and transfer efficiency and diatom relative abundance that do not necessarily reflect ballast or direct ecosystem effects, respectively. This suggests that it might be difficult to differentiate between ecosystem and ballast effects in observations. The model's skill in reproducing sediment trap observations is equal to or better than that of other parameterizations. However, the sparseness and relatively large uncertainties of sediment trap data makes it difficult to accurately evaluate the skill of the model and other parameterizations. More POC flux observations, over a wider range of ecological regimes, are necessary to thoroughly evaluate and test model results and better understand the processes controlling POC flux to depth in the ocean.},

  abstract = {Phototrophic microbial mats are compact ecosystems composed of highly interactive organisms in which energy and element cycling take place over millimeter-to-centimeter-scale distances. Although microbial mats are common in hypersaline environments, they have not been extensively characterized in systems dominated by divalent ions. Hot Lake is a meromictic, epsomitic lake that occupies a small, endorheic basin in north-central Washington. The lake harbors a benthic, phototrophic mat that assembles each spring, disassembles each fall, and is subject to greater than tenfold variation in salinity (primarily Mg(2+) and SO(2-) 4) and irradiation over the annual cycle. We examined spatiotemporal variation in the mat community at five time points throughout the annual cycle with respect to prevailing physicochemical parameters by amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene coupled to near-full-length 16S RNA clone sequences. The composition of these microbial communities was relatively stable over the seasonal cycle and included dominant populations of Cyanobacteria, primarily a group IV cyanobacterium (Leptolyngbya), and Alphaproteobacteria (specifically, members of Rhodobacteraceae and Geminicoccus). Members of Gammaproteobacteria (e.g., Thioalkalivibrio and Halochromatium) and Deltaproteobacteria (e.g., Desulfofustis) that are likely to be involved in sulfur cycling peaked in summer and declined significantly by mid-fall, mirroring larger trends in mat community richness and evenness. Phylogenetic turnover analysis of abundant phylotypes employing environmental metadata suggests that seasonal shifts in light variability exert a dominant influence on the composition of Hot Lake microbial mat communities. The seasonal development and organization of these structured microbial mats provide opportunities for analysis of the temporal and physical dynamics that feed back to community function.},

  abstract = {Working memory and short-term memory are closely related in their cognitive architecture, capacity limitations, and functional neuroanatomy, which only partly overlap with those of long-term memory. The author reviews the functional neuroimaging literature on the commonalities and differences between working memory and short-term memory and the interplay of areas with modality-specific and supramodal representations in the brain networks supporting these fundamental cognitive processes. Sensory stores in the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortex play a role in short-term memory, but supramodal parietal and frontal areas are often recruited as well. Classical working memory operations such as manipulation, protection against interference, or updating almost certainly require at least some degree of prefrontal support, but many pure maintenance tasks involve these areas as well. Although it seems that activity shifts from more posterior regions during encoding to more anterior regions during delay, some studies reported sustained delay activity in sensory areas as well. This spatiotemporal complexity of the short-term memory/working memory networks is mirrored in the activation patterns that may explain capacity constraints, which, although most prominent in the parietal cortex, seem to be pervasive across sensory and premotor areas. Finally, the author highlights open questions for cognitive neuroscience research of working memory, such as that of the mechanisms for integrating different types of content (binding) or those providing the link to long-term memory.

However, a thorough independent benchmark comparing state-of-the-art metagenome analysis tools is lacking. Here, we present a benchmark where the most widely used tools are tested on complex, realistic data sets. Our results clearly show that the most widely used tools are not necessarily the most accurate, that the most accurate tool is not necessarily the most time consuming and that there is a high degree of variability between available tools.

Day-to-day water stagnation in building plumbing can potentially result in water quality deterioration (e.g., lead release or pathogen proliferation), which is a major public health concern. However, little is known about the microbial ecosystem processes in plumbing systems, hindering the development of biological monitoring strategies. Here, we track tap water microbiome assembly in situ, showing that bacterial community composition changes rapidly from the city supply following \textasciitilde 6-day stagnation, along with an increase in cell count from 103 cells/mL to upwards of 7.8\,×\,105 cells/mL. Remarkably, bacterial community assembly was highly reproducible in this built environment system (median Spearman correlation between temporal replicates\,=\,0.78). Using an island biogeography model, we show that neutral processes arising from the microbial communities in the city water supply (i.e., migration and demographic stochasticity) explained the island community composition in proximal pipes (Goodness-of-fit\,=\,0.48), yet declined as water approached the faucet (Goodness-of-fit\,=\,0.21). We developed a size-effect model to simulate this process, which indicated that pipe diameter drove these changes by mediating the kinetics of hypochlorite decay and cell detachment, affecting selection, migration, and demographic stochasticity. Our study challenges current water quality monitoring practice worldwide which ignore biological growth in plumbing, and suggests the island biogeography model as a useful framework to evaluate building water system quality.},

We investigated seasonal and spatial variability in P limitation and biological utilization in the Bay using nutrient stoichiometry (of both dissolved and particulate forms), phosphate oxygen isotope ratios, and alkaline phosphatase activity at three sites along the salinity gradient. We demonstrate that particulate nutrient ratios can be used as indicators of nutrient limitation in the Bay and suggest strong seasonal and spatial variability in P availability: the surface water is P limiting in spring, but this condition is alleviated in summer and in the deeper waters. Variability in P limitation is well reflected in the trends of phosphate oxygen isotope composition (δ18OP), with values approaching isotopic equilibrium under P limiting conditions, suggesting rapid biological P turnover. Furthermore δ18OP values suggest multiple phosphate sources including remobilization of terrestrial inorganic P phases and remineralization of organic P and P from both sources is sufficiently cycled by microorganisms, suggested by the extensive equilibrium oxygen isotope exchange. Our results further suggest high P utilization in the deeper euphotic zone where nutrients are abundant, raising caution on studying nutrient availability and limitation only in the surface water.},

From 1991 to 2008 an average of ∼19 P. minimum bloom events were observed every year, and the median number of HAB events has increased from ∼13 per year in the 1990s to 23 in the 2000s. An average of 91 (range 50–150) CyanoHAB events were observed every year over this decadal time period but there was not a significant trend of increase. Data for K. veneficum before 2003 are compromised by varying identifications for this species, but annual occurrences of K. veneficum blooms have increased significantly from {$<$}5 to {$>$}30 in the 5 year time period from 2003 to 2008. Using previously defined chlorophyll a criteria, and analogously developed criteria for each of these HAB, across all years and sites the most common condition was medium eutrophic. CyanoHAB were more common in salinities {$<$}5, while those of the dinoflagellates were most common at salinities from 5 to 10. P. minimum blooms generally started from late spring, while K. veneficum and CyanoHAB bloomed in summer and autumn. Differences in the relationships between these HAB types and water quality parameters suggest or provide confirmatory evidence of physiological differences in these species groups in response to nutrients. High cell densities of P. minimum were associated with the lowest PO43− concentrations while blooms of K. veneficum were more likely to be associated with high P concentrations and lower dissolved inorganic nitrogen:phosphorus (DIN:DIP) ratios, but with still measurable N and P in the water column, during summer. The CyanoHAB typically occur in summer, when the molar DIN:DIP ratio is low, but again during which N and P were still measurable in the water column. Given current trends in nutrient loading, Chesapeake Bay appears to be driven toward nutrient loading with higher DIN:DIP in the later spring and early summer than the 1980s. Consequently HAB such as P. minimum, with its physiological capability to access low P availability or to obtain alternate P sources, may be favored.},

The genome of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has multiple genes encoding type 2 DGATs (DGTTs). Here we present detailed functional and biochemical analyses of Chlamydomonas DGTTs. In vitro enzyme analysis using a radiolabel-free assay revealed distinct substrate specificities of three DGTTs: CrDGTT1 preferred polyunsaturated acyl CoAs, CrDGTT2 preferred monounsaturated acyl CoAs, and CrDGTT3 preferred C16 CoAs. When diacylglycerol was used as the substrate, CrDGTT1 preferred C16 over C18 in the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone, but CrDGTT2 and CrDGTT3 preferred C18 over C16. In vivo knockdown of CrDGTT1, CrDGTT2 or CrDGTT3 resulted in 20-35\% decreases in TAG content and a reduction of specific TAG fatty acids, in agreement with the findings of the in vitro assay and fatty acid feeding test. These results demonstrate that CrDGTT1, CrDGTT2 and CrDGTT3 possess distinct specificities toward acyl CoAs and diacylglycerols, and may work in concert spatially and temporally to synthesize diverse TAG species in C. reinhardtii. CrDGTT1 was shown to prefer prokaryotic lipid substrates and probably resides in both the endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplast envelope, indicating its role in prokaryotic and eukaryotic TAG biosynthesis. Based on these findings, we propose a working model for the role of CrDGTT1 in TAG biosynthesis. This work provides insight into TAG biosynthesis in C. reinhardtii, and paves the way for engineering microalgae for production of biofuels and high-value bioproducts.},

  abstract = {Particle-attached (PA) and free-living (FL) microorganisms play significant but different roles in mineralization of organic matter (OM) in the ocean. Currently, little is known about PA and FL microbial communities in bathyal and abyssal pelagic waters, and understanding of their diversity and distribution in the water column and their interactions with environmental factors in the trench area is limited. We investigated for the first time the variations of abundance and diversities of the PA and FL bacterial communities in the epi-, bathy- and abyssopelagic zones of the New Britain Trench (NBT). The PA communities showed decreasing species richness but increasing relative abundance with depth, suggesting the increasing ecological significance of the PA bacteria in the deep ocean. The abundance and diversity of PA and FL bacterial communities in the NBT water column appeared to be shaped by different sets of environment factors, which might be related to different micro-niches of the two communities. Analysis on species distribution suggested that the differences between PA and FL bacteria communities mainly resulted from the different relative abundance of the “shared taxa” in the two types of communities. These findings provide valuable information for understanding the relative ecological roles of the PA and FL bacterial communities and their interactions with environmental factors in different pelagic zones along the vertical profile of the NBT water column.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies and fronts in the ocean greatly impact lateral transport and in turn the trajectories of sinking particles. Such influence was explored for April and October 2012 in the Gulf of Mexico using numerical simulations performed with a regional model at 1-km horizontal resolution. Results are compared qualitatively to field samples from two sediment traps located at GC600 (27°22.5 N, 90°30.7 W) and AT357 (27°31.5 N, 89°42.6 W), 81 km apart. In April the traps collected a comparable amount of material, while in October the flux at GC600 greatly exceeded that at AT357. Through inverse calculations, several thousand particle trajectories were reconstructed multiple times from the ocean surface to the depth of the traps (approximately 1,000 m) using a range of sinking velocities, 20–100 m d–1. Taken together, model results and trap data indicate that cross-shore transport of riverine input induced by mesoscale eddies, and convergence and divergence processes at the scale of a few kilometers, significantly impact the trajectory of sinking particles. The large majority of modeled particles reach the bottom faster than would be expected by their sinking speeds alone. This finding is associated with submesoscale-induced horizontal convergence in the mixed layer that aggregates particles preferentially in downwelling regions, accelerating their descent. Furthermore, this study confirms that the cone of influence of vertical fluxes is highly variable in both space and time in the presence of an energetic eddy field, especially for particles with sinking velocity of 50 m d–1 or less. It also demonstrates that the variability of vertical fluxes in the Gulf of Mexico is highly complex and can be understood only by considering the mesoscale circulation and seasonal cycle of primary productivity, which in turn are linked to riverine inputs, wind forcing and the seasonal cycle of the mixed-layer depth.},

  abstract = {Particulate phosphorus (PP) in the water column is an essential component of phosphorus (P) cycling in the Chesapeake Bay because P often limits primary productivity, yet its composition and transformation remain undercharacterized. To understand the mobilization of PP and P sequestration in the water column, we studied seasonal variations in particulate organic and inorganic P species at three sites in the Chesapeake Bay, using chemical extractions, 1-D (31P) and 2-D (1H-31P) NMR spectroscopies, and electron microprobe analyses. Our results suggest that an average of 9\% and 50\% of water column PP was recycled in shallow and deep sites, respectively, primarily through remineralization of organic P, which was 3 times higher than Fe-bound P remobilization. P recycling efficiency was highest in the warm and anoxic seasons. Organic P compositions and concentrations responded strongly to seasonal and redox variations: orthophosphate monoesters and diesters, and diester-to-monoester ratios (D/M) decreased with depth; both esters and D/M ratios were lower in the anoxic waters in July and September. In contrast, pyrophosphate concentration increased with depth and polyphosphate concentration was high in anoxic seasons. Our analyses suggest the presence of Ca-phosphate minerals (Ca-P) in the water column but with concentrations comparable to sediment Ca-P. It is unclear, however, whether authigenic precipitation occurred in the water column or resuspended from sediments. Overall, these results reveal the dominance of internal P cycling particularly via organic P remineralization and controlling P availability in the water column of the Chesapeake Bay.},

The hypothesis of TEP-driven coagulation in three disparate systems, a freshwater lake, a coastal ocean, and a saltwater mesocosm was evaluated, by comparing TEP abundance to several related factors including phytoplankton concentrations, measured sediment fluxes, and abundances of large aggregates. The timing of large aggregate formation and sedimentation events was related to coagulation rates expressed in terms of particle half-lives, t12, calculated as the time for TEP or phytoplankton to decrease to half their concentration through shear coagulation. While TEP have been previously investigated only in marine systems, it is reported here that TEP also can be present in high concentrations (860 ml−1) in freshwater lakes (Lake Constance, Germany) and that high fluxes of particulate organic matter at depth coincide with the disappearance of abundant TEP from overlying waters. The half-lives of TEP in the three different systems indicate that large aggregate formation and massive sedimentation events following diatom blooms occur when the TEP half-life decreases to less than a few days. By comparing TEP and phytoplankton half-lives in these systems, it is concluded that the formation of rapidly sinking aggregates following blooms of mucous-producing diatoms is primarily controlled by concentrations of TEP, not phytoplankton.},

However, host-associated microbial communities themselves can act as a source of opportunistic pathogens depending on the environment. Marine poikilotherms and their microbiota are strongly influenced by temperature, but experimental studies exploring how temperature affects the interactions between both parties are rare. To assess the effects of temperature, temperature stress and infection on diversity, composition and dynamics of the hemolymph microbiota of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas), we conducted an experiment in a fully-crossed, three-factorial design, in which the temperature acclimated oysters (8 or 22\,°C) were exposed to temperature stress and to experimental challenge with a virulent Vibrio sp. strain. We monitored oyster survival and repeatedly collected hemolymph of dead and alive animals to determine the microbiome composition by 16s rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing. We found that the microbial dynamics and composition of communities in healthy animals (including infection survivors) were significantly affected by temperature and temperature stress, but not by infection. The response was mediated by changes in the incidence and abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and accompanied by little change at higher taxonomic levels, indicating dynamic stability of the hemolymph microbiome. Dead and moribund oysters, on the contrary, displayed signs of community structure disruption, characterized by very low diversity and proliferation of few OTUs. We can therefore link short-term responses of host-associated microbial communities to abiotic and biotic factors and assess the potential feedback between microbiota dynamics and host survival during disease.},

  abstract = {Unveiling the factors and processes that shape the dynamics of host associated microbial communities (microbiota) under natural conditions is an important part of understanding and predicting an organism's response to a changing environment. The microbiota is shaped by host (i.e. genetic) factors as well as by the biotic and abiotic environment. Studying natural variation of microbial community composition in multiple host genetic backgrounds across spatial as well as temporal scales represents a means to untangle this complex interplay. Here, we combined a spatially-stratified with a longitudinal sampling scheme within differentiated host genetic backgrounds by reciprocally transplanting Pacific oysters between two sites in the Wadden Sea (Sylt and Texel). To further differentiate contingent site from host genetic effects, we repeatedly sampled the same individuals over a summer season to examine structure, diversity and dynamics of individual hemolymph microbiota following experimental removal of resident microbiota by antibiotic treatment. While a large proportion of microbiome variation could be attributed to immediate environmental conditions, we observed persistent effects of antibiotic treatment and translocation suggesting that hemolymph microbial community dynamics is subject to within-microbiome interactions and host population specific factors. In addition, the analysis of spatial variation revealed that the within-site microenvironmental heterogeneity resulted in high small-scale variability, as opposed to large-scale (between-site) stability. Similarly, considerable within-individual temporal variability was in contrast with the overall temporal stability at the site level. Overall, our longitudinal, spatially-stratified sampling design revealed that variation in hemolymph microbiota is strongly influenced by site and immediate environmental conditions, whereas internal microbiome dynamics and oyster-related factors add to their long-term stability. The combination of small and large scale resolution of spatial and temporal observations therefore represents a crucial but underused tool to study host-associated microbiome dynamics.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Pico-plankton and nano-plankton are generally thought to represent a negligible fraction of the total particulate organic carbon (POC) export flux in oligotrophic gyres due to their small size, slow individual sinking rates, and tight grazer control that leads to high rates of recycling in the euphotic zone. Based upon recent inverse modeling and network analysis however, it has been hypothesized that pico-plankton, including the cyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, and nano-plankton contribute significantly to POC export, via formation and gravitational settling of aggregates and/or consumption of those aggregates by mesozooplankton, in proportion to their contribution to net primary production. This study presents total suspended particulate ({$>$}0.7 μm) and particle size-fractionated (10–20 μm, 20–53 μm, {$>$}53 μm) pigment concentrations from within and below the euphotic zone in the oligotrophic subtropical North Atlantic, collected using Niskin bottles and large volume in-situ pumps, respectively. Results show the indicator pigments for Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus and nano-eukaryotes are; (1) found at depths down to 500 m, and; (2) essentially constant, relative to the sum of all indicator pigments, across particle size fractions ranging from 10 μm to {$>$}53 μm. Based upon the presence of chlorophyll precursor and degradation pigments, and that in situ pumps do not effectively sample fecal pellets, it is concluded that these pigments were redistributed to deeper waters on larger, more rapidly sinking aggregates likely by gravitational settling and/or convective mixing. Using available pigment and ancillary data from these cruises, these Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus and nano-plankton derived aggregates are estimated to contribute 2–13\% (5 ± 4\%), 1–20\% (5 ± 7\%), and 6–43\% (23 ± 14\%) of the total sediment trap POC flux measured on the same cruises, respectively. Furthermore, nano-eukaryotes contribute equally to POC export and autotrophic biomass, while cyanobacteria contributions to POC export are one-tenth of their contribution to autotrophic biomass. These field observations provide direct evidence that pico- and nano-plankton represent a significant contribution to the total POC export via formation of aggregates in this oligotrophic ocean gyre. We suggest that aggregate formation and fate should be included in ecosystem models, particularly as oligotrophic regions are hypothesized to expand in areal extent with warming and increased stratification in the future.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that bacterial abundance and species diversity in the ocean's water column are variable at the millimeter scale, apparently in response to the small-scale heterogeneity in the distribution of organic matter. We hypothesized that bacterium-bacterium antagonistic interactions may contribute to variations in community structure at the microscale. We examined each of the 86 isolates for their inhibition of growth of the remaining 85 isolates by the Burkholder agar diffusion assay. More than one-half of the isolates expressed antagonistic activity, and this trait was more common with particle-associated bacteria than with free-living bacteria. This was exemplified by members of the α subclass of the class Proteobacteria (α-proteobacteria), in which production of antagonistic molecules was dominated by attached bacteria. We found that γ-proteobacteria (members of the ordersAlteromonadales and Vibrionales) are the most prolific producers of inhibitory materials and also the most resilient to them, while members of the Bacteriodetes were the organisms that were least productive and most sensitive to antagonistic interactions. Widespread interspecies growth inhibition is consistent with the role of this phenomenon in structuring bacterial communities at the microscale. Furthermore, our results suggest that bacteria from pelagic marine particles may be an underutilized source of novel antibiotics.},

Despite this, we do not know the instantaneous nor maximum growth rates of most naturally-occurring microorganisms. Recent reports indicate DNA replication rates can be estimated from metagenomic coverage, and maximum growth rates can be estimated from genomic characteristics. We tested these approaches with native marine bacteria ({$<$}0.6 um size fraction) as 10\% inoculum grown in unamended virus-free seawater from the San Pedro Channel, California. This allowed microbial growth without grazing and with greatly reduced viral infection. At multiple time points up to 48 h, we sampled for cell abundances and metagenomic analyses. We generated 101 unique Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) including α, β, and γ Proteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Marine Group A/SAR406, MGII archaea, and others. We tracked the growth of each as the fraction of total metagenomic reads mapped to each MAG normalized with length, completeness, and total cell counts. Some MAGs did not grow appreciably, but those we could estimate had growth rates ranging from 0.08 to 5.99 d             −1             ; these are the first reported growth rates for several of the groups. These metagenome-determined growth rates, which often changed within experiments, were compared to (a) DNA replication estimates from the ‘peak-to-trough’ ratio (PTR) as determined by three different approaches, and (b) maximum growth rates predicted from codon usage bias (CUB). For the large majority of taxa, observed growth rates were not correlated to PTR indices (r \textasciitilde{} −0.26 - 0.08), with exceptions being rapidly growing             Oceanospirillales             and             Saccharospirillaceae             (r \textasciitilde{} 0.63 - 0.92). However, CUB was moderately well correlated to observed maximum growth rates (r = 0.57). This suggests that maximum growth rates can be reasonably well-estimated from genomic information alone, but current PTR approaches poorly predict actual growth of most marine planktonic bacteria in unamended seawater.},

Codenitrification and denitrification by fungi are additional pathways producing N2 in soils. However, fungal codenitrification and denitrification have not been well investigated in agricultural soils. To evaluate bacterial and fungal processes contributing to N2 production, molecular and 15N isotope analyses were conducted with soil samples collected at six different agricultural fields in the United States. Denitrifying and anammox bacterial abundances were measured based on quantitative PCR (qPCR) of nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) and hydrazine oxidase (hzo) genes, respectively, while the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of Fusarium oxysporum was quantified to estimate the abundance of codenitrifying and denitrifying fungi. 15N tracer incubation experiments with 15NO3 − or 15NH4 + addition were conducted to measure the N2 production rates from anammox, denitrification, and codenitrification. Soil incubation experiments with antibiotic treatments were also used to differentiate between fungal and bacterial N2 production rates in soil samples. Denitrifying bacteria were found to be the most abundant, followed by F. oxysporum based on the qPCR assays. The potential denitrification rates by bacteria and fungi ranged from 4.118 to 42.121 nmol N2-N g−1 day−1, while the combined potential rates of anammox and codenitrification ranged from 2.796 to 147.711 nmol N2-N g−1 day−1. Soil incubation experiments with antibiotics indicated that fungal codenitrification was the primary process contributing to N2 production in the North Carolina soil.

A large ensemble of a single Earth system model is used to clearly identify the forced component of change in interior oxygen distributions and to evaluate the magnitude of this signal relative to noise generated by internal climate variability. The time of emergence of forced trends is quantified on the basis of anomalies in oxygen concentrations and trends. We find that the forced signal should already be evident in the southern Indian Ocean and parts of the eastern tropical Pacific and Atlantic basins; widespread detection of forced deoxygenation is possible by 2030–2040. In addition to considering spatially discrete metrics of detection, we evaluate the similarity of the spatial structures associated with natural variability and the forced trend. Outside of the subtropics, these patterns are not wholly distinct on the isopycnal surfaces considered, and therefore, this approach does not provide significantly advanced detection. Our results clearly demonstrate the strong impact of natural climate variability on interior oxygen distributions, providing an important context for interpreting observations.},

In this study, we examined the effect of habitat size on the density of Spartina alterniflora shoots in tidal saltwater marshes, as well as on the two predominant macrofaunal species, the marsh periwinkle Littoraria irrorata and fiddler crabs Uca spp. We estimated the density of shoots in three different marsh habitats, (1) large island marshes, (2) small island marshes, and (3) large fringing marshes, in Indian Field Creek, York River, Chesapeake Bay. We manipulated shoot density in each of the marsh types to distinguish between the effects of marsh grass density and marsh type on crab and Littoraria densities in the system. We found significant differences in grass density among the three marsh types as well as significant species-specific effects of grass density, marsh type, and distance from edge on faunal abundance. Decreasing the shoot density resulted in a decrease in Littoraria density in the large marshes. Littoraria density increased with distance from edge in the small marshes and in the first 5 m of the fringing marshes, then decreased with distance from edge after 5 m in the fringing marshes. Shoot density had a negative effect on crabs in both the large and small marshes. These results suggest that fragmentation would have a negative effect on the community structure by lowering the densities of both the flora and fauna.},

  abstract = {Hypoxia is an environmental Stressor that affects abundance, biomass, diversity, and ecosystem function of benthic assemblages worldwide, yet its collective impact at individual, population, and ecosystem levels has rarely been investigated. We examined the effects of hypoxia on the biomass-dominant clam, Macoma balthica, in the York and Rappahannock Rivers (Chesapeake Bay, USA). We (1) surveyed the M. balthica populations in both rivers in 2003 and 2004, (2) determined the effects of low dissolved oxygen (DO) on M. balthica fecundity in a laboratory experiment, and (3) employed a predator-exclusion field experiment to establish the effects of hypoxia and prey density on prédation upon M. balthica. The resultant data were used to parameterize a matrix model, which was analyzed to define potential effects of hypoxia at the population level. In both rivers, hypoxia decreased individual clam growth and caused local extinction of populations. Hypoxia reduced egg production of M. balthica by 40\% and increased protein investment per egg. In the predatorexclusion field experiment, hypoxia magnified prédation rates threefold and altered the functional response of predators to M. balthica from a stabilizing type III functional response to a destabilizing type II functional response. In a density-independent matrix model, hypoxia resulted in coupled source-sink metapopulation dynamics, with hypoxic areas acting as blackhole sinks. Increases in the spatial and temporal extent of hypoxia caused the populations to decline toward extinction. In a second model that incorporated density dependence, under mild hypoxic conditions trophic transfer from M. balthica to predators increased, but at increased spatial or temporal extent of hypoxia trophic transfer decreased. The major decline in trophic transfer to predators under severe hypoxia resulted from diversion of M. balthica biomass into the microbial loop. Our model predicted that there are multiple stable states for M. balthica populations (high and very low densities), such that the saddle point (threshold at which the population switches from one state to the other) increased and resilience decreased with the spatial extent of hypoxia. We underscore how effects of a Stressor at the individual level can combine to have substantial population and ecosystem-level effects.},

To test this hypothesis, it was necessary to design and test a protocol to sample, lyse and analyze (by polymerase chain reaction/denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [PCR-DGGE]) bacterioplankton species richness in a single microliter of seawater. Significant variation in bacterial species richness was found amongst 1 mul samples, Greater species richness was seen when seawater was enriched with diatom detritus, Examination of species richness at 2 mm intervals over a 20 mm transect showed greater variability during the peak abundance of Lingulodinium polyedrum when compared to the late stage of the bloom. Overall species richness was highest in samples enriched with organic particles. These results suggest that particulate organic matter may, in part, regulate the level of bacterial species richness as well as cause patchiness in the small-scale distribution of species, Microscale patchiness of bacterial species may have important implications in carbon cycling and biogeochemistry, not only at the microscale but also at the ocean basin scale.},

  abstract = {We have used two metagenomic approaches, direct sequencing of natural samples and sequencing after enrichment, to characterize communities of prokaryotes associated to particles. In the first approximation, different size filters (0.22 and 5 μm) were used to identify prokaryotic microbes of free-living and particle-attached bacterial communities in the Mediterranean water column. A subtractive metagenomic approach was used to characterize the dominant microbial groups in the large size fraction that were not present in the free-living one. They belonged mainly to Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Flavobacteria and Proteobacteria. In addition, marine microbial communities enriched by incubation with different kinds of particulate material have been studied by metagenomic assembly. Different particle kinds (diatomaceous earth, sand, chitin and cellulose) were colonized by very different communities of bacteria belonging to Roseobacter, Vibrio, Bacteriovorax and Lacinutrix that were distant relatives of genomes already described from marine habitats. Besides, using assembly from deep metagenomic sequencing from the particle-specific enrichments we were able to determine a total of twenty groups of contigs (eight of them with {$>$}50\% completeness) and reconstruct de novo five new genomes of novel species within marine clades ({$>$}79\% completeness and {$<$}1.8\% contamination). We also describe for the first time the genome of a marine Rhizobiales phage that seems infect a broad range of Alphaproteobacteria and live in habitats as diverse as soil, marine sediment and water column. The metagenomic recruitment of the communities found by direct sequencing in the large size filter and by enrichment had nearly no overlap. These results indicate that these reconstructed genomes are part of the rare biosphere which exists at nominal levels under natural conditions.},

In the laboratory studies, all three viruses were quite stable at 4 degrees C, with infectious virus still detectable after 46 weeks of incubation. In situ studies on virus survival in free-flowing estuarine or marine waters showed that, although the viruses were more labile in natural waters than in the laboratory studies, they persisted for several months, in some cases during the winter months. At all temperatures and salinities, coxsackievirus B-5 was the most stable, echovirus-6 was intermediate, and poliovirus 1 was the least stable of the viruses tested.},

The correlation between the occurrence of V. cholerae in Chesapeake Bay and environmental factors was investigated over a 3-year period. Water and plankton samples were collected monthly from five shore sampling sites in northern Chesapeake Bay (January 1998 to February 2000) and from research cruise stations on a north-south transect (summers of 1999 and 2000). Enrichment was used to detect culturable V. cholerae, and 21.1\% (n = 427) of the samples were positive. As determined by serology tests, the isolates, did not belong to serogroup O1 or O139 associated with cholera epidemics. A direct fluorescent-antibody assay was used to detect V. cholerae O1, and 23.8\% (n = 412) of the samples were positive. V. cholerae was more frequently detected during the warmer months and in northern Chesapeake Bay, where the salinity is lower. Statistical models successfully predicted the presence of V. cholerae as a function of water temperature and salinity. Temperatures above 19°C and salinities between 2 and 14 ppt yielded at least a fourfold increase in the number of detectable V. cholerae. The results suggest that salinity variation in Chesapeake Bay or other parameters associated with Susquehanna River inflow contribute to the variability in the occurrence of V. cholerae and that salinity is a useful indicator. Under scenarios of global climate change, increased climate variability, accompanied by higher stream flow rates and warmer temperatures, could favor conditions that increase the occurrence of V. cholerae in Chesapeake Bay.},

We developed a ternary community distance index to quantify the variability in protist community structure in these heterogeneous surface layers. This index was highly correlated (r = 0.984, n = 6) with the extent of physical interleaving (quantified as the root mean square deviations in temperature between measured and smoothed profiles) indicating a high degree of physical-biotic coupling within water columns of the polynya. Water mass layering created favorable conditions for ciliate blooms. These blooms were associated with distinct temperature-salinity layers. These layers might act as processing traps for particulate organic matter, with highest concentrations of viruses and bacteria (specifically cells with open or leaky membranes, suggesting microbial grazing pressure) occurring in highly interleaved water columns. In contrast, viral and bacterial concentrations were lowest at a noninterleaved station where protist biomass was dominated by flagellates and small dinoflagellates that were evenly distributed down the water column. Water mass interleaving is likely to contribute to microbial biodiversity, community structure and vertical segmentation of biogeochemical processes in the upper ocean.},

Correlation is popular as a statistical measure of pairwise association but should not be used on data that carry only relative information. Using timecourse yeast gene expression data, we show how correlation of relative abundances can lead to conclusions opposite to those drawn from absolute abundances, and that its value changes when different components are included in the analysis. Once all absolute information has been removed, only a subset of those associations will reliably endure in the remaining relative data, specifically, associations where pairs of values behave proportionally across observations. We propose a new statistic ϕ to describe the strength of proportionality between two variables and demonstrate how it can be straightforwardly used instead of correlation as the basis of familiar analyses and visualization methods.},

  abstract = {The assessment of microbial diversity and distribution is a major concern in environmental microbiology. There are two general approaches for measuring community diversity: quantitative measures, which use the abundance of each taxon, and qualitative measures, which use only the presence/absence of data. Quantitative measures are ideally suited to revealing community differences that are due to changes in relative taxon abundance (e.g., when a particular set of taxa flourish because a limiting nutrient source becomes abundant). Qualitative measures are most informative when communities differ primarily by what can live in them (e.g., at high temperatures), in part because abundance information can obscure significant patterns of variation in which taxa are present. We illustrate these principles using two 16S rRNA-based surveys of microbial populations and two phylogenetic measures of community beta diversity: unweighted UniFrac, a qualitative measure, and weighted UniFrac, a new quantitative measure, which we have added to the UniFrac website (http://bmf.colorado.edu/unifrac). These studies considered the relative influences of mineral chemistry, temperature, and geography on microbial community composition in acidic thermal springs in Yellowstone National Park and the influences of obesity and kinship on microbial community composition in the mouse gut. We show that applying qualitative and quantitative measures to the same data set can lead to dramatically different conclusions about the main factors that structure microbial diversity and can provide insight into the nature of community differences. We also demonstrate that both weighted and unweighted UniFrac measurements are robust to the methods used to build the underlying phylogeny.},

  abstract = {In marine systems, nitrate is the major reservoir of inorganic fixed nitrogen. The only known biological nitrate-forming reaction is nitrite oxidation, but despite its importance, our knowledge of the organisms catalyzing this key process in the marine N-cycle is very limited. The most frequently encountered marine NOB are related to Nitrospina gracilis, an aerobic chemolithoautotrophic bacterium isolated from ocean surface waters. To date, limited physiological and genomic data for this organism were available and its phylogenetic affiliation was uncertain. In this study, the draft genome sequence of N. gracilis strain 3/211 was obtained. Unexpectedly for an aerobic organism, N. gracilis lacks classical reactive oxygen defense mechanisms and uses the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle for carbon fixation. These features indicate microaerophilic ancestry and are consistent with the presence of Nitrospina in marine oxygen minimum zones. Fixed carbon is stored intracellularly as glycogen, but genes for utilizing external organic carbon sources were not identified. N. gracilis also contains a full gene set for oxidative phosphorylation with oxygen as terminal electron acceptor and for reverse electron transport from nitrite to NADH. A novel variation of complex I may catalyze the required reverse electron flow to low-potential ferredoxin. Interestingly, comparative genomics indicated a strong evolutionary link between Nitrospina, the nitrite-oxidizing genus Nitrospira, and anaerobic ammonium oxidizers, apparently including the horizontal transfer of a periplasmically oriented nitrite oxidoreductase and other key genes for nitrite oxidation at an early evolutionary stage. Further, detailed phylogenetic analyses using concatenated marker genes provided evidence that Nitrospina forms a novel bacterial phylum, for which we propose the name Nitrospinae.},

A floodplain segment of the Danube River downstream of Vienna was studied during the hydrologically most dynamic phase (spring–summer) to evaluate the significance of connection between the main channel and the floodplain segment for particle abundance and quality as well as for bacterial and viral parameters, both free-living and attached to particles. 2. Hydrological connectivity between the main channel and its floodplain segment (expressed as water age) influenced particle abundance and quality. Polysaccharide-containing particles [Alcian positive-stained particles (ASP)] and protein-containing particles [Coomassie positive-stained particles (CSP)] each contributed a substantial fraction to total suspended solids and were both positively related to water age. ASP were about twice as abundant as CSP. 3. Water age influenced bacterial and viral abundance and the bacterioplankton productivity in the surrounding water. Free-living bacterial abundance and their bacterial secondary production (BSP) increased continuously with water age, best described by a linear regression. Water age also significantly impacted BSP and per cell BSP of bacteria attached to particles. The abundance of attached bacteria and viruses was not influenced by water age. 4. Bacteria and viruses on particles were influenced by particle quality. Their abundance on particles was closely related to particle size. Particle-attached bacteria accounted on average for 30.34\% (± 3.09) of the total bacterial abundance. A variable and occasionally significant proportion of viruses, between 0.43\% and 35.06\%, were associated with particulate material. 5. Bacteria attached to particles were significantly more productive than their free-living counterparts. Their per-cell activity was on average 8.6 times higher than that of the free-living fraction. 6. Hydrological connectivity between the Danube River and its floodplain is crucial not only for the exchange of water, sediment and nutrients, but also for microbiota, thus influencing microbial life, distribution and activity.},

Since the vast majority of environmental microorganisms are uncultured, metagenomics has become an important tool to genotype the microbial community. This study uses a recently developed computational method to confidently assign metagenomic reads to microbial clades without the requirement of metagenome assembly by comparing the evolutionary pattern of nucleotide sequences at non-synonymous sites between metagenomic and orthologous reference genes. We found evidence for new, ecologically relevant metabolic pathways in several lineages of surface ocean bacterioplankton using the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) metagenomic data, including assimilatory sulfate reduction and alkaline phosphatase capabilities in the alphaproteobacterial SAR11 clade, and proteorhodopsin-like genes in the cyanobacterial genus Prochlorococcus. These findings raise new hypotheses about microbial roles in energy flux and organic matter transformation in the ocean.},

  abstract = {We investigate the functioning of the ocean’s biological pump by analyzing the vertical transfer efficiency of particulate organic carbon (POC). Data evaluated include globally distributed time series of sediment trap POC flux, and remotely sensed estimates of net primary production (NPP) and sea surface temperature (SST). Mathematical techniques are developed to compare these temporally discordant time series using NPP and POC flux climatologies. The seasonal variation of NPP is mapped and shows regional- and basin-scale biogeographic patterns reflecting solar, climatic, and oceanographic controls. Patterns of flux are similar, with more high-frequency variability and a subtropical-subpolar pattern of maximum flux delayed by about 5 days per degree latitude increase, coherent across multiple sediment trap time series. Seasonal production-to-flux analyses indicate during intervals of bloom production, the sinking fraction of NPP is typically half that of other seasons. This globally synchronous pattern may result from seasonally varying biodegradability or multiseasonal retention of POC. The relationship between NPP variability and flux variability reverses with latitude, and may reflect dominance by the large-amplitude seasonal NPP signal at higher latitudes. We construct algorithms describing labile and refractory flux components as a function of remotely sensed NPP rates, NPP variability, and SST, which predict POC flux with accuracies greater than equations typically employed by global climate models. Globally mapped predictions of POC export, flux to depth, and sedimentation are supplied. Results indicate improved ocean carbon cycle forecasts may be obtained by combining satellite-based observations and more mechanistic representations taking into account factors such as mineral ballasting and ecosystem structure.},

Compositional data suggested at-sea exchange did not fully flush coastal Bacteria from all tanks; there were several instances of a genetic geographic signal.

  abstract = {Previous surveys of very dry Atacama Desert mineral soils have consistently revealed sparse communities of non-photosynthetic microbes. The functional nature of these microorganisms remains debatable given the harshness of the environment and low levels of biomass and diversity. The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of the phylogenetic community structure and metabolic potential of a low-diversity mineral soil metagenome that was collected from a high-elevation Atacama Desert volcano debris field. We pooled DNA extractions from over 15 g of volcanic material, and using whole genome shotgun sequencing, observed only 75–78 total 16S rRNA gene OTUs3\%. The phylogenetic structure of this community is significantly under dispersed, with actinobacterial lineages making up 97.9–98.6\% of the 16S rRNA genes, suggesting a high degree of environmental selection. Due to this low diversity and uneven community composition, we assembled and analyzed the metabolic pathways of the most abundant genome, a Pseudonocardia sp. (56–72\% of total 16S genes). Our assembly and binning efforts yielded almost 4.9 Mb of Pseudonocardia sp. contigs, which accounts for an estimated 99.3\% of its non-repetitive genomic content. This genome contains a limited array of carbohydrate catabolic pathways, but encodes for CO2 fixation via the Calvin cycle. The genome also encodes complete pathways for the catabolism of various trace gases (H2, CO and several organic C1 compounds) and the assimilation of ammonia and nitrate. We compared genomic content among related Pseudonocardia spp. and estimated rates of non-synonymous and synonymous nucleic acid substitutions between protein coding homologs. Collectively, these comparative analyses suggest that the community structure and various functional genes have undergone strong selection in the nutrient poor desert mineral soils and high-elevation atmospheric conditions.},

Carbon-source utilization within the water column, however, is not a bulk property because microbial communities are patchily distributed on suspended organic aggregates (i.e., marine snow, marine aggregates, river aggregates, organic detritus, and bioflocs). In this study, Biolog Ecoplates were used to evaluate the metabolic capacity of heterotrophic bacterial communities associated with aggregates compared to communities in the surrounding water. Overall, aggregate-associated microbial communities demonstrated higher levels of metabolism, metabolic versatility, and functional redundancy, and a more consistent pattern of carbon-source utilization compared with water-associated communities. In addition, aggregate-associated communities more effectively exploited available resources, including representatives from several biochemical guilds and nitrogen-containing carbon sources. Within the aggregate-associated microbial community, metabolic activity was significantly higher in the presence of polymers, amino acids, and carbohydrates relative to amines and carboxylic acids. In comparison, metabolic activity of water-associated communities exceeded a threshold value for only two of the five guilds (polymers and carbohydrates) evaluated. These results suggest that compared with their free-living counterparts, aggregate-associated communities have a greater capacity to respond to a wider array of carbon inputs. Results also underscore the importance of targeting organic aggregates to better understand the role of microbial processes in ecosystem functioning.},

We demonstrate the theory’s relevance for microbial communities in aquatic environments by describing the community metabolic response and functional diversity of individual organic aggregates while documenting the persistence of potential pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria. Our results support the 4 predictions, including a significant species–area relationship, consistency of species richness at equilibrium, non-zero level of species turnover at equilibrium, and variance to mean ratios of less than 0.5 at equilibrium. The aggregate-associated microbial communities demonstrated significantly higher rates of metabolic response and functional diversity, and contained higher concentrations of culturable vibrios and fecal indicator bacteria compared to aggregate-free water, supporting the idea that organic aggregates are sites of favorable habitat surrounded by a less favorable matrix. These results substantiate that organic aggregates may be represented as microscopic islands. Using island biogeography theory to understand the microbial ecology of aquatic pathogens associated with organic aggregates is important with respect to environmental sampling of recreational waters and mathematical modeling of the transmission of waterborne diseases from aquatic reservoirs to humans.},

The area has a pronounced oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) that impacts the distribution of both migrating and mesopelagic species. Sampling was conducted at a relatively fine scale (mesopelagic depth intervals as small as 25 m) within ecologically relevant strata to assess how this hydrographic environment influenced the structure of these groups. Zooplankton were collected in vertically stratified Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System tows during the day and the night, and abundances were analyzed in association with variations in oxygen concentration, temperature and depth. Each vertical stratum of the water column was a unique ecological zone with a specific community makeup. The upper and midwater column (0–550 m) was strongly influenced by diel vertical migration patterns, particularly the daytime descent of euphausiids and myctophid fish into the core of the OMZ. Distinctly different communities occurred below the OMZ core. The lower oxycline (LO) (∼500–700 m depth range) was dominated by Cyclothone spp. fish as well as a diverse population of other taxa, often aggregated into a discrete layer (25 m thick), particularly in 2008. In the suboxycline (\&gt;700 m depth range), the community shifted to typical bathypelagic taxa. These finer scale vertical patterns provided new insight into the ecological structure of OMZs, revealing the unique layering at the LO and differential impacts on diel vertical migrators.},

  abstract = {Laboratory and field studies of the passive solid-phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) method have been carried out around the world. A wide range of marine micro-algal toxins have been detected and the potential of the method to provide reliable, sensitive, time-integrated sampling to monitor the occurrence of toxic algal bloom events has been demonstrated. The method has several important advantages over current phytoplankton and shellfish monitoring methods. Trials of various adsorption substrates have been carried out and the best candidates have been selected for the lipophilic marine biotoxin groups; however, research continues to locate suitable substrates for the more polar water-soluble compounds such as domoic acid and the saxitoxins. The technique has also been successfully applied to the detection of a range of freshwater cyanobacterial toxins.},

Chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments were measured by HPLC using a diode-array detector. A PC-based computer program was used to optimise the pigment ratios and to estimate the contributions of 10 algal classes to the total chlorophyll a concentration at each location and in 7 separate depth bands. For the pigments that occur in more than one algal class, the pigment: chlorophyll a ratios for 19'-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin and 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (chrysophytes and haptophytes), neoxanthin (prasinophytes, euglenophytes and chlorophytes) and chlorophyll b (prasinophytes, euglenophytes, prochlorophytes and chlorophytes) increase with depth, while those of violaxanthin (prasinophytes and chlorophytes), diadinoxanthin (dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, haptophytes, euglenophytes and diatoms), lutein (prasinophytes and chlorophytes) and, zeaxanthin (prasinophytes, cyanobacteria, prochlorophytes and chlorophytes) decrease with depth. Peridinin: chlorophyll a increases with depth in dinoflagellates, while alloxanthin: chlorophyll a decreases with depth in cryptomonads. The only pigment ratio that does not change consistently with depth is that of fucoxanthin, which increases with depth in chrysophytes and haptophytes but decreases in diatoms. Based on their contribution to the total chlorophyll a, cyanobacteria (Synechococcus) were dominant in the nutrient depleted surface waters, haptophytes were dominant at mid depth (70~m), and prochlorophytes were dominant at depths of 100-125~m. These three algal classes were by far the most important, and each contributed up to 30-40\% of the total chloro-phyll a at some depth within the water column. Chlorophytes and chrysophytes contributed up to a maximum of about 12\% of the total chlorophyll a, while cryptophytes, diatoms, dinoflagellates, prasinophytes and (possibly) euglenophytes generally contributed up to 4-8\% of the chlorophyll a.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We describe a new program for calculating algal class abundances from measurements of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The program uses factor analysis and a steepest descent algorithm to find the best fit to the data based on an initial guess of the pigment ratios for the classes to be determined. The program was tested with a range of synthetic data-sets that were constructed from known pigment ratios selected to be representative of samples of phytoplankton collected from the Southern Ocean and the Equatorial Pacific. Random errors were added both to the pigment ratios and to the calculated data-sets to simulate both uncertainties in the initial guess as to the pigment concentrations of each class and respectively experimental errors in the analysis of the pigments by HPLC. Provided that the analytical data is of good quality, the program can successfully determine the class abundances, even when the initial estimates of the pigment ratios contain large errors. Of particular interest is the observation that the program can provide good estimates of prochlorophytes, even in the absence of experimental data on the concentrations of divinyl-chlorophylls a and b. The program is not restricted to the estimation of phytoplankton and can be used whenever specific biomarkers exist that can be used as indicators of biological or chemical processes.},

Odour and pH of oyster meats were also investigated. Estimation of microbiological counts by microbial culture highlighted growth of psychrotrophic bacteria. During storage, odour scores (a score describing deterioration of fresh odours where a score of 1 is fresh and 4 is completely spoiled) increased from 1.0 to 3.0 for Pacific oysters and from 1.3 to 3.4 for Sydney rock oysters. pH results obtained for both species fluctuated during storage (range 6.28-6.73) with an overall increase at end of storage. Pyrosequencing revealed that the majority of bacteria at Day 0 represented taxa from amongst the Proteobacteria, Tenericutes and Spirochaetes that have not been cultured and systematically described. During storage, Proteobacteria became abundant with Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio found to be dominant in both oyster species at Day 7. Analysis of the pyrosequencing data showed significant differences in bacterial profiles between oyster species and storage time (both P~=~0.001). As oysters spoiled, bacterial profiles between oyster species became more similar indicating a common spoilage profile. Data presented here provides detailed insight into the changing bacterial profile of shucked oysters during storage and has identified two genera, Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio, as being important in spoilage of shucked oysters.},

Previous transcriptomic studies of Sulfolobus solfataricus identified vapBC6 as a heat-shock (HS)-inducible member of the Vap toxin-antitoxin gene family. In this study, the inactivation of the vapBC6 operon by targeted gene disruption produced two recessive phenotypes related to fitness, HS sensitivity and a heat-dependent reduction in the rate of growth. In-frame vapBC6 deletion mutants were analyzed to examine the respective roles of each protein. Since vapB6 transcript abundance was elevated in the vapC6 deletion, the VapC6 toxin appears to regulate abundance of its cognate antitoxin. In contrast, vapC6 transcript abundance was reduced in the vapB6 deletion. A putative intergenic terminator may underlie these observations by coordinating vapBC6 expression. As predicted by structural modeling, recombinant VapC6 produced using chaperone cosynthesis exhibited heat-dependent ribonucleolytic activity toward S. solfataricus total RNA. This activity could be blocked by addition of preheated recombinant VapB6. In vivo transcript targets were identified by assessing the relative expression of genes that naturally respond to thermal stress in VapBC6-deficient cells. Preferential increases were observed for dppB-1 and tetR, and preferential decreases were observed for rpoD and eIF2 gamma. Specific VapC6 ribonucleolytic action could also be demonstrated in vitro toward RNAs whose expression increased in the VapBC6-deficient strain during heat shock. These findings provide a biochemical mechanism and identify cellular targets underlying VapBC6-mediated control over microbial growth and survival at temperature extremes.},

Recent studies have revealed microbial co-occurrence patterns in soil microbial communities, yet the geographic pattern of topological features in soil microbial co-occurrence networks at the continental scale are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the shifts of topological features in co-occurrence networks inferred from soil microbiota along a continental scale in eastern China. Integrating archaeal, bacterial and fungal community datasets, we inferred a meta-community co-occurrence network and analyzed node-level and network-level topological shifts associated with five climatic regions. Both node-level and network-level topological features revealed geographic patterns wherein microorganisms in the northern regions had closer relationships but had a lower interaction influence than those in the southern regions. We further identified topological differences associated with taxonomic groups and demonstrated that co-occurrence patterns were random for archaea and non-random for bacteria and fungi. Given that microbial interactions may contribute to soil functions more than species diversity, this geographic shift of topological features provides new insight into studying microbial biogeographic patterns, their organization and impacts on soil-associated function.},

Analyses suggested that settling invariance was the result of a trade-off between the aggregate bulk (excess) density and its fractal architecture. An analysis of the governing quantities of the aggregate fractal scaling (i.e., the primary particle size and fractal dimension as well as its rate of change over the aggregate size) explained how these ultimately affected the settling rate.},

  abstract = {Cleanrooms have been considered microbially-reduced environments and are used to protect human health and industrial product assembly. However, recent analyses have deciphered a rather broad diversity of microbes in cleanrooms, whose origin as well as physiological status has not been fully understood. Here, we examined the input of intact microbial cells from a surrounding built environment into a spacecraft assembly cleanroom by applying a molecular viability assay based on propidium monoazide (PMA). The controlled cleanroom (CCR) was characterized by \textasciitilde 6.2*10 3  16S rRNA gene copies of intact bacterial cells per m 2  floor surface, which only represented 1\% of the total community that could be captured via molecular assays without viability marker. This was in contrast to the uncontrolled adjoining facility (UAF) that had 12 times more living bacteria. Regarding diversity measures retrieved from 16S rRNA Illumina-tag analyzes, we observed, however, only a minor drop in the cleanroom facility allowing the conclusion that the number but not the diversity of microbes is strongly affected by cleaning procedures. Network analyses allowed tracking a substantial input of living microbes to the cleanroom and a potential enrichment of survival specialists like bacterial spore formers and archaeal halophiles and mesophiles. Moreover, the cleanroom harbored a unique community including 11 exclusive genera, e.g.,  Haloferax  and  Sporosarcina , which are herein suggested as indicators of cleanroom environments. In sum, our findings provide evidence that archaea are alive in cleanrooms and that cleaning efforts and cleanroom maintenance substantially decrease the number but not the diversity of indoor microbiomes.},

Principal variables are ∑CO2, alkalinity, phosphate, oxygen, and silicate. The carbon variables are defined for 12C, 13C, and 14C separately. In addition to these carbon isotopes, 39A and δ18O of dissolved oxygen are predicted. The model predicts realistic global patterns of tracer distribution.

The abundance and compositions of microorganisms in these marine snow varied seasonally with elevated primary production in spring-summer and turbid water intrusion from the Mackenzie shelf area during an open water period.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Marine Bacteria and Archaea (‘bacteria’) interact with upper ocean productivity to fundamentally influence its biogeochemical fate with consequences for ecosystems and global climate. Most bacteria-mediated carbon cycling is due to numerically dominant free-living bacteria, but their adaptive strategies to interact with primary productivity are not fully understood. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we made the surprising discovery that a substantial, and variable, fraction (on average 30 ± 17.8\% with a range of 0 to 55\%) of ‘free-living’ bacteria in our samples from California coastal and open ocean environments were, in fact, intimately associated with other bacteria at nanometer to micrometer scales. Twenty-one to 43\% of bacteria, including Synechococcus, were conjoint. Such close associations could indicate symbioses; however, they could also be antagonistic, parasitic, neutral, or accidental. Further, a substantial fraction (4 to 55\%) of bacteria was connected by pili and gels into cell-cell pairs or occurred in networks of up to 20 cells. We frequently observed nanoparticles associated with the networks, raising the question of their identity and origin (e.g. scavenged from the seawater colloid pool by the networks or produced by the bacteria within the networks). The networks occasionally contained structures that morphologically resembled coccoliths or protist scales. These may impart ballast to sinking particles if the networks coalesce to form larger, sinking, particles. Our finding of abundant bacteria-bacteria associations and possible microenvironment structuring by pelagic bacteria offers a novel context for bacterial ecology and diversity and models of ocean productivity and elemental cycling.},

  abstract = {In microbial oceanography, cell size, volume and carbon (C) content of pelagic bacteria and archaea (‘bacteria’) are critical parameters in addressing the in situ physiology and functions of bacteria, and their role in the food web and C cycle. However, because of the diminutive size of most pelagic bacteria and errors caused by sample fixation and processing, an accurate measurement of the size and volume has been challenging. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to obtain high-resolution images of pelagic bacteria and Synechococcus. We measured the length, width and height of live and formalin-fixed pelagic bacteria, and computed individual cell volumes. AFM-based measurements were compared with those by epifluorescence microscopy (EFM) using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The ability to measure cell height by AFM provides methodological advantage and ecophysiological insight. For the samples examined, EFM (DAPI)-based average cell volume was in good agreement (1.1-fold) with live sample AFM. However, the agreement may be a fortuitous balance between cell shrinkage due to fixation/drying (threefold) and Z-overestimation (as EFM does not account for cell flattening caused by sample processing and assumes that height=width). The two methods showed major differences in cell volume and cell C frequency distributions. This study refines the methodology for quantifying bacteria-mediated C fluxes and the role of bacteria in marine ecosystems, and suggests the potential of AFM for individual cell physiological interrogations in natural marine assemblages.},

  abstract = {Cable bacteria induce long-distance electron transport in the seafloor and can exert a powerful control on the elemental cycling in marine sediments by creating extreme excursions in porewater pH. Yet, the natural distribution of cable bacteria is still largely unknown, and so their role in coastal biogeochemical cycling remains poorly quantified. Here we show that cable bacteria can be abundant in the sediments of intertidal bivalve reefs, where they strongly influence the pore water geochemistry, resulting in a potentially beneficial interaction between the sulfur oxidizing microbes and biodepositing fauna. Cable bacteria occurred in sediments accumulating within mussel and oyster reefs in the Wadden Sea (The Netherlands), at cumulative filament densities up to 1038 m cm-2. Additionally, cable bacteria were found at moderately high cumulative filament densities (up to 56 m cm-2) in a heavily bioturbated sandy sediment adjacent to the muddy reefs. Microsensor profiling revealed strong sulfide removal and intense acid generation associated with the electrogenic sulfide oxidation metabolism of the cable bacteria. Strongly elevated concentrations of dissolved calcium (up to 35 mM), manganese (up to 250 µM), and iron (up to 700 µM) were observed in the pore waters, consistent with acidity-driven dissolution of calcium carbonates and iron sulfides. This field study provides substantive evidence that cable bacteria exert a decisive control on the cycling of sulfur and carbonate minerals in cohesive coastal sediments, and identifies that the distribution and influence of cable bacteria covers a greater range of natural habitats than previously believed.},

  abstract = {SAR11 bacteria are abundant in marine environments, often accounting for 35\% of total prokaryotes in the surface ocean, but little is known about their involvement in marine biogeochemical cycles. Previous studies reported that SAR11 bacteria are very small and potentially have few ribosomes, indicating that SAR11 bacteria could have low metabolic activities and could play a smaller role in the flux of dissolved organic matter than suggested by their abundance. To determine the ecological activity of SAR11 bacteria, we used a combination of microautoradiography and fluorescence in situ hybridization (Micro-FISH) to measure assimilation of 3H-amino acids and [35S]dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) by SAR11 bacteria in the coastal North Atlantic Ocean and the Sargasso Sea. We found that SAR11 bacteria were often abundant in surface waters, accounting for 25\% of all prokaryotes on average. SAR11 bacteria were typically as large as, if not larger than, other prokaryotes. Additionally, more than half of SAR11 bacteria assimilated dissolved amino acids and DMSP, whereas about 40\% of other prokaryotes assimilated these compounds. Due to their high abundance and activity, SAR11 bacteria were responsible for about 50\% of amino acid assimilation and 30\% of DMSP assimilation in surface waters. The contribution of SAR11 bacteria to amino acid assimilation was greater than would be expected based on their overall abundance, implying that SAR11 bacteria outcompete other prokaryotes for these labile compounds. These data suggest that SAR11 bacteria are highly active and play a significant role in C, N, and S cycling in the ocean.},

Spatially averaged TEP and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations were positively correlated over the 2 yr period, although these parameters were rarely correlated on a sample-to-sample basis. Maximum TEP concentrations were often spatially separated from chl a maxima, suggesting that TEP in ETM regions is controlled by formation, concentration, and transport processes rather than proximity to precursor source material. Significant correlations between TEP and phaeophytin a, POC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total suspended solids, and degree of stratification were observed during some sampling periods. Settling tube experiments revealed a positive correlation between TEP concentration and the fraction of settling particulate matter, indicating either enhanced local aggregation and settling or transport and accumulation of aggregates formed elsewhere in the ETM region. These results indicate that TEP constitutes a very large fraction of POC in ETM regions, and suggest that TEP contributes to the formation and maintenance of ETM.},

They are considered to be particularly important in nutrient-rich coastal ecosystems and at high latitudes, but considerably less so in the oligotrophic open ocean. The Tara Oceans circumnavigation collected samples from a wide range of oceanic regions using a standardized sampling procedure. Here, a total of ∼12 million diatom V9-18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) ribotypes, derived from 293 size-fractionated plankton communities collected at 46 sampling sites across the global ocean euphotic zone, have been analyzed to explore diatom global diversity and community composition. We provide a new estimate of diversity of marine planktonic diatoms at 4,748 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Based on the total assigned ribotypes, Chaetoceros was the most abundant and diverse genus, followed by Fragilariopsis, Thalassiosira, and Corethron. We found only a few cosmopolitan ribotypes displaying an even distribution across stations and high abundance, many of which could not be assigned with confidence to any known genus. Three distinct communities from South Pacific, Mediterranean, and Southern Ocean waters were identified that share a substantial percentage of ribotypes within them. Sudden drops in diversity were observed at Cape Agulhas, which separates the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, and across the Drake Passage between the Atlantic and Southern Oceans, indicating the importance of these ocean circulation choke points in constraining diatom distribution and diversity. We also observed high diatom diversity in the open ocean, suggesting that diatoms may be more relevant in these oceanic systems than generally considered.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors regulating our microbiota is important but requires appropriate statistical methodology. When comparing two or more populations most existing approaches either discount the underlying compositional structure in the microbiome data or use probability models such as the multinomial and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, which may impose a correlation structure not suitable for microbiome data. OBJECTIVE: To develop a methodology that accounts for compositional constraints to reduce false discoveries in detecting differentially abundant taxa at an ecosystem level, while maintaining high statistical power. METHODS: We introduced a novel statistical framework called analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM). ANCOM accounts for the underlying structure in the data and can be used for comparing the composition of microbiomes in two or more populations. ANCOM makes no distributional assumptions and can be implemented in a linear model framework to adjust for covariates as well as model longitudinal data. ANCOM also scales well to compare samples involving thousands of taxa. RESULTS: We compared the performance of ANCOM to the standard t-test and a recently published methodology called Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG) methodology (1) for drawing inferences on the mean taxa abundance in two or more populations. ANCOM controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at the desired nominal level while also improving power, whereas the t-test and ZIG had inflated FDRs, in some instances as high as 68\% for the t-test and 60\% for ZIG. We illustrate the performance of ANCOM using two publicly available microbial datasets in the human gut, demonstrating its general applicability to testing hypotheses about compositional differences in microbial communities. CONCLUSION: Accounting for compositionality using log-ratio analysis results in significantly improved inference in microbiota survey data.},

The virion is rod shaped particle of 300 × 15 nm containing positive sense ssRNA of 6.4 kb as its genome. No insect vector is known to transmit the virus in a specific manner. The virus is highly stable, contagious and sap transmissible. Several isolates have been described from different countries in Eurasian regions infecting important cucurbits such as bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), gherkin (Cucumis anguria), muskmelon (Cucumis melo) and watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris). Symptomatology of the virus is characterized by systemic green mottle mosaic on foliage. Some of the isolates induce serious fruit symptoms such as pulp deterioration (‘blood flesh’ disease) in watermelon. The complete genome of CGMMV is composed of 6424 nucleotides containing four open reading frames encoding replicase proteins, movement protein and coat protein. The CGMMV isolates form a distinct evolutionary clade separated from the other cucurbit-infecting tobamovirus species. Several sensitive methods are available for reliable diagnosis of CGMMV of which ELISA and RT-PCR are commonly used. Immunofilter paper assay and bioelectric recognition assay have been shown for rapid test of CGMMV. Control of CGMMV is difficult as commercial cultivars are susceptible. Limited source of resistance is known in muskmelon and wild Cucumis spp. The transgenic approach holds a greater potential in developing resistant varieties against CGMMV in any cucurbit.},

The outbreak of COVID-19 as Public Health Emergency of International Concern is declared by World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. The known route of transmission is due to direct contact or via respiratory droplets. Recently, several studies reported SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in wastewater treatment plant samples. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater may predict COVID-19 occurrence qualitatively and quantitatively. The concept is known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) or sewage epidemiology. The present study reviewed the presence of coronavirus in wastewater and investigations relating to WBE development as a tool to detect COVID-19 community transmission. Few articles reported a correlation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater with the number of COVID-19 cases, whereas few reported higher prediction by wastewater surveillance than confirmed cases. The application of WBE is still in a preliminary stage but has the potential to indicate an early sign of transmission. The knowledge of persistence of coronavirus in municipal and hospital wastewater is needed for the application of WBE and to understand the chances of transmission. The studies reported more prolonged survival of coronavirus in low-temperature wastewater. Studies relating to the inactivation of coronavirus by disinfectants and removal of coronavirus are also presented. Research on the performance of the commonly adopted disinfection technologies in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 in municipal and hospital wastewater is required to reduce the risk associated with municipal and hospital wastewater.},

Intact Dinophysis spp. cells representing 34.4\% of the total Dinophysis cells ingested by the copepods were found within the pellets. T. longicornis was the only dominant copepod species in the area that fed on Dinophysis spp., thus the pellets produced by T. longicornis were the main source of copepod “toxic” pellets in the media during blooms of Dinophysis spp. These “toxic” pellets might contribute to the maintenance of the toxic algal blooms, if the cells inside the pellets remain viable, can spread the potential toxicity of the toxic dinoflagellates throughout the pelagic food web due to coprophagy, and/or be an important toxic vector into the benthic food web. However, during a Dinophysis spp. bloom, the percentage of cells excreted daily within the pellets was lower than 1\% of the total dinoflagellate population and, moreover, copepod faecal pellets represent a small fraction of the sinking material in this area. Although it was not possible to measure the amount of toxins in the pellets, we concluded that copepod faecal pellets do not have an important role in the transport of DSP toxins through the food web in this area.},

  abstract = {The rapid recent decline of Arctic Ocean sea ice area increases the flux of solar radiation available for primary production and the area of open water for air-sea gas exchange. We use a regional physical-biogeochemical model of the Arctic Ocean, forced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research atmospheric reanalysis, to evaluate the mean present-day CO2 sink and its temporal evolution. During the 1996-2007 period, the model suggests that the Arctic average sea surface temperature warmed by 0.04 degrees Ca-1, that sea ice area decreased by approximate to 0.1 x 10(6)km(2)a(-1), and that the biological drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon increased. The simulated 1996-2007 time-mean Arctic Ocean CO2 sink is 586TgCa(-1). The increase in ice-free ocean area and consequent carbon drawdown during this period enhances the CO2 sink by approximate to 1.4TgCa(-1), consistent with estimates based on extrapolations of sparse data. A regional analysis suggests that during the 1996-2007 period, the shelf regions of the Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas experienced an increase in the efficiency of their biological pump due to decreased sea ice area, especially during the 2004-2007 period, consistent with independently published estimates of primary production. In contrast, the CO2 sink in the Barents Sea is reduced during the 2004-2007 period due to a dominant control by warming and decreasing solubility. Thus, the effect of decreasing sea ice area and increasing sea surface temperature partially cancel, though the former is dominant.},

In order to develop empirical algorithms for CDOM and DOC, the CDOM absorption coefficient (aCDOM) was correlated with in situ remote sensing reflectance band ratios, and DOC was then derived from aCDOM through the aCDOM to DOC relationships. Our validation analyses demonstrate successful retrieval of DOC and CDOM using MODIS and SeaWiFS with mean absolute percent differences from field measurements of 9.3 ± 7.3\% for DOC, 19 ± 14\% for aCDOM(355), 15.5 ± 12\% for aCDOM(443), and 8.6 ± 4.9\% for the CDOM spectral slope. To our knowledge, the algorithms presented here represent the first validated algorithms for satellite retrieval of aCDOM, DOC, and CDOM spectral slope in the coastal ocean. Satellite imagery demonstrates the importance of riverine/estuarine discharge from Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay to the export of CDOM and DOC to the coastal ocean. Between spring and summer, photooxidation has a significant impact on CDOM distributions resulting in a pronounced decrease in aCDOM between the midshelf and continental slope region of the MAB. The satellite-derived DOC products demonstrate the net ecosystem production of DOC of 12 to 34 μmol C L−1 between spring and summer. The aCDOM algorithms presented here are applicable to other coastal regions and can also be used to retrieve DOC using region-specific aCDOM to DOC relationships.},

This is only 20\% of the regularly occupied stations and leads to high variability in the estimate of mean production per cruise. We examine 500 stations occupied between 1984 (CalCOFI 8401) and 1994 (CalCOFI 9401) at which both production data and chlorophyll data were collected. A good relationship is found between the logarithm (base 10) of chlorophyll a integrated from the surface to 200 m (Chi) and integrated half-day primary production (P), standardized for potentially available half-day sunlight (L'): P/L' = -617.3 + 495.3 (log(10) Chi) where the light scaling factor, L', is approximated as L' = 2.625 + 1.125cos [360/365 (Julian day - 173)] This regression is highly significant and explains 64\% of the variability of the standardized production. Thus the chlorophyll data may be used as a proxy for primary production, providing a more detailed map of the spatial distribution of production and a better cruise mean estimate than is possible from the productivity stations alone. The success of this regression is examined for CalCOFI cruises 9403, 9408, and 9410.},

  abstract = {The ecological stoichiometry of microbial biomass has most often focused on the ratio of the biologically-important elements carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) and has primarily been examined at a resolution where the contribution of the individual is masked by the reported population or community average. However, reporting population or community averages makes it difficult to assess phenotypic plasticity and stochasticity and mask important information required to understand both the drivers and implications of microbial biomass stoichiometry in nature. One way to assess the diversity of individual microbial phenotypes is through the use of single-cell techniques such as energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). EDS reports cellular quotas for the majority of elements composing microbial biomass including C, N, and P. In this study, by measuring individual cells within a microbial community or population, we describe for the first time the stoichiometry of microbial biomass as a distribution instead of an average. Exploration of stoichiometric trait distributions (as presented here) has the potential to improve our understanding of how nutrients interact with individual microorganisms to structure the elemental content of bacterial biomass and better describe how bacterial community biomass affects the ecosystems within which these organisms exist.},

There was little to no trend in the virus-to-bacteria ratio with increasing trophy. Analysis of covariance revealed significant differences between relations in marine and freshwater systems. The virusto-bacteria ratio was significantly higher in freshwater (mode = 22.5) than marine environments (mode = 2.51, and there were significantly more bacteria per unit chlorophyll in our freshwater samples. We suggest that this difference is related to the increased dependence of freshwater bacteria on allochthonous material relative to marine systems, a s well a s the increased relative importance of photosynthetic cyanobacteria in lakes.},

  abstract = {Understanding the nature of interpopulation interactions in host-associated microbial communities is critical to understanding gut colonization, responses to perturbations, and transitions between health and disease. Characterizing these interactions is complicated by the complexity of these communities and the observation that even if populations can be cultured, their in vitro and in vivo phenotypes differ significantly. Dynamic models are the cornerstone of computational systems biology and a key objective of computational systems biologists is the reconstruction of biological networks (i.e., network inference) from high-throughput data. When such computational models reflect biology, they provide an opportunity to generate testable hypotheses as well as to perform experiments that are impractical or not feasible in vivo or in vitro. We modeled time-series data for murine microbial communities using statistical approaches and systems of ordinary differential equations. To obtain the dense time-series data, we sequenced the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene from DNA isolated from the fecal material of germfree mice colonized with cecal contents of conventionally raised animals. The modeling results suggested a lack of mutualistic interactions within the community. Among the members of the Bacteroidetes, there was evidence for closely related pairs of populations to exhibit parasitic interactions. Among the Firmicutes, the interactions were all competitive. These results suggest future animal and in silico experiments. Our modeling approach can be applied to other systems to provide a greater understanding of the dynamics of communities associated with health and disease.},

Measurements of sea surface temperature (SST), mixed layer depth, and upwelling indices provided concurrent data on physical oceanographic parameters. Both total zooplankton and krill abundance dramatically declined in the summer of 1997 coincident with a rapid increase in SST and mixed layer depth. Changes in euphausiid community composition occurred in concert with the decline in overall abundance. The relative abundance of the southern neritic Nyctiphanes simplex increased from August to November in 1997, the abundance of cold temperate Euphausia pacifica decreased significantly, and that of the northern neritic Thysanoessa spinifera declined dramatically. The sudden appearance of an adult cohort of N. simplex in July 1997 suggests that rapid poleward flow characteristic of coastally trapped Kelvin waves occurred between June and July of 1997. The persistent presence of warm temperate and subtropical taxa in samples collected between August 1997 and October 1998 indicates that this poleward flow continued in 1998. Zooplankton abundance, euphausiid community composition, and physical oceanographic parameters gradually returned to a more typical upwelling-dominated state in the spring and summer of 1998. E. pacifica and T spinifera abundances gradually increased during the summer and fall of 1998, while N. simplex abundance abruptly declined in the spring of 1998. However, this recovery was confined to a narrow coastal band as a result of the onshore movement of the oceanic waters of the California Current. This was reflected by higher than normal numbers of the oceanic Nematoscelis difficilis within samples collected during the spring and summer of 1998. By the spring and summer of 1999, both zooplankton and euphausiid abundance had increased to the highest levels recorded during the 3-year study. Both E. pacifica and T. spinifera abundance increased relative to 1998 while N. simplex was completely absent in all samples. These changes reflected the cooler, highly productive environmental conditions associated with the 1998/1999 La Nina. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Viruses on organic aggregates such as transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) are not well investigated. The number of TEP-attached viruses was assessed along trophic gradients in the southwestern lagoon of New Caledonia by determining the fraction of viruses removed after magnetic isolation of TEP. In order to isolate TEP magnetically, TEP were formed in the presence of magnetic beads from submicrometer precursors collected along the trophic gradients. The mixed aggregates of TEP-beads-viruses were removed from solution with a magnetic field. The percentage of viruses associated with newly formed TEP averaged 8\% (range, 3 to 13\%) for most of the stations but was higher (ca. 30\%) in one bay characterized by the low renewal rate of its water mass. The number of viruses (N) attached to TEP varied as a function of TEP size (d [in micrometers]) according to the formulas N = 100d1.60 and N = 230d1.75, respectively, for TEP occurring in water masses with short (i.e., {$<$}40 days) and long (i.e., {$>$}40 days) residence times. These two relationships imply that viral abundance decreases with TEP size, and they indicate that water residence time influences viral density and virus-bacterium interactions within aggregates. Our data suggest that the fraction of viruses attached to TEP is highest in areas characterized by a low renewal rate of the water mass and can constitute at times a significant fraction of total virus abundance. Due to the small distance between viruses and hosts on TEP, these particles may be hot spots for viral infection.},

In this paper, data from a CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) and an airborne infrared (IR) camera are shown to detect a municipal wastewater discharge off the southeast coast of Florida, U. S. A., through its elevated levels of chromophoric dissolved organic matter plus detrital material (CDOM) and cooler sea surface temperatures. CDOM levels within a similar to 15-m-diameter surface 'boil' are found to be about twice those in the ambient shelf water, and surface temperatures near the boil are lower by similar to 0.4 degrees C, comparable to the vertical temperature difference across the ambient water column. The CASI and IR imagery show a nearly identically shaped buoyant plume, consistent with a fully surfacing discharge, but the IR data more accurately delineate the area of most rapid dilution as compared with previous in-situ measurements. The imagery also allows identification of ambient oceanographic processes that affect dispersion and transport in the far field. This includes an alongshore front, which limits offshore dispersion of the discharge, and shoreward-propagating nonlinear internal waves, which may be responsible for an enhanced onshore transport of the discharge.},

  abstract = {The use of probiotics is receiving considerable attention as an alternative approach to control microbiota in aquaculture farms, especially in hatching facilities. However, application with consistent results is hampered by insufficient information on their modes of action. To investigate whether dead bacteria (allowing investigation of their nutritional effect) or live bacteria (allowing evaluation of their probiotic effect) have any beneficial effect towards Artemia franciscana and, subsequently, if live bacteria have probiotic effects beyond the effects observed with dead bacteria, a model system was employed using gnotobiotic Artemia as a test organism. Nauplii were cultured in the presence of 10 bacterial strains combined with four different major axenic live feeds (two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and two strains of Dunaliella tertiolecta) differing in their nutritional values. In combination with poor- and medium-quality live feeds, dead bacteria exerted a strong effect on Artemia survival but a rather weak or no effect on individual length and constituted a maximum of only 5.9\% of the total ash-free dry weight supplied. These effects were reduced or even disappeared when medium- to good-quality major feed sources were used, possibly due to improvements in the health status of Artemia. Some probiotic bacteria, such as GR 8 (Cytophaga spp.), improved (not always significantly) the performance of nauplii beyond the effect observed with dead bacteria, independently of the feed supplied. The present approach can be an excellent system to study the exact mode of action of bacteria, especially if combined with challenge tests or other types of analysis (e.g., transcriptome and proteonomic analysis).},

A better understanding of the host–microbe interactions is certainly essential to develop effective solutions of disease control for the aquaculture industry. As demonstrated in terrestrial animals, the use of gnotobiotic systems (animals cultured in axenic conditions or with a known microflora) can be an excellent tool to extent the understanding of the mechanisms involved in host–microbe interactions and to evaluate new treatments of disease control. Several aquatic animals were cultured so far in germ-free conditions, such as fish, molluscs, crustaceans, rotifers, echinoderms, cnidarians, turbellarians, ascidians and echiurans. The aim of the present review is to recapitulate the findings obtained with gnotobiotic aquatic animals over the last decades, with special emphasis to the host–microbe interactions, as well as the perspectives for future research in this field. In addition, the procedures utilized to culture axenic aquatic animals and to verify contaminations are summarized, and the standardization of these procedures is proposed.},

The daily supplementation with D. tertiolecta conferred full protection to Artemia towards both vibrios and was apparently more efficient and stable than the use of probiotics and dead bacteria. Only when Artemia were cultured in sub-optimal conditions with microalgae (but not when fed ad libitum), the addition of probiotic bacteria was able to partially protect the animals against both pathogens. The contribution of dead bacteria to the protection of Artemia against both pathogens was more pronounced in animals cultured with poor-quality feeds.}

  abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a neurotoxin produced by diatoms from the genera Pseudo-nitzschia and Nitzschia. DA is transferred through the food web when consumed by organisms such as copepods (e.g., Acartia tonsa). DA bioaccumulates in higher trophic levels and poses a threat to human health through amnesic shellfish poisoning. Laboratory experiments using a DA reference standard demonstrated that mild turbulence facilitates formation of organic polymer aggregates {$>$}0.6~µm in-vivo that can scavenge dissolved DA (dDA). Using A. tonsa, we demonstrate that DA can be assimilated through consumption of these organic polymers which scavenged dDA —a pathway which does not require direct ingestion of the toxin-producer Pseudo-nitzschia. In filtered seawater with spiked DA, copepods accumulated 24.8~±~4.7 pg DA copepod−1 (2.1~ppm) on average by consuming organic polymers. This was validated in one out of five experiments using ambient DA concentrations. Copepods were suspended in particle-free seawater and accumulated 14.4~±~3.8 pg DA copepod−1 (1.20~ppm), and in particle-concentrated seawater they accumulated 40.9~±~3.8 pg DA copepod−1 (3.42~ppm). Data from this experiment suggests that \textasciitilde 34\% of the total assimilated DA entered via an organic polymer-bound DA pathway. This experiment had the highest Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance (\textasciitilde 225,000 cells L~−~1) and cellular toxin quota, up to 0.88 pg DA cell−1, relative to the other four ambient DA experiments. These results demonstrate the potential for DA to enter the marine food web through an alternate pathway and may have considerable implications to understanding the flow of DA through marine food webs, and how we monitor DA and its potential vectors into the food web.},

Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines. The procedures are also illustrated analysing data on plasma beta-carotene levels from a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States.},

We know very little about geographical variability in the remineralization depth of this sinking material and less about what controls such variability. Here we present previously unpublished profiles of mesopelagic POC flux derived from neutrally buoyant sediment traps deployed in the North Atlantic, from which we calculate the remineralization length scale for each site. Combining these results with corresponding data from the North Pacific, we show that the observed variability in attenuation of vertical POC flux can largely be explained by temperature, with shallower remineralization occurring in warmer waters. This is seemingly inconsistent with conclusions drawn from earlier analyses of deep-sea sediment trap and export flux data, which suggest lowest transfer efficiency at high latitudes. However, the two patterns can be reconciled by considering relatively intense remineralization of a labile fraction of material in warm waters, followed by efficient downward transfer of the remaining refractory fraction, while in cold environments, a larger labile fraction undergoes slower remineralization that continues over a longer length scale. Based on the observed relationship, future increases in ocean temperature will likely lead to shallower remineralization of POC and hence reduced storage of CO2 by the ocean.},

Diatoms, dinoflagellates, and cryptomonads are among the major flora downstream in the tributaries and within the Chesapeake Bay. Water quality conditions within the three tributaries have remained rather stable over this time period; while there are long term trends of reduced nutrients, increasing bottom oxygen, and decreasing water clarity for the lower Chesapeake Bay.

However, the overall status of the phytoplankton populations is presently favorable, in that it is mainly represented and dominated by taxa suitable as a major food and oxygen source within this ecosystem.

  abstract = {The central aims of many host or environmental microbiome studies are to elucidate factors associated with microbial community compositions and to relate microbial features to outcomes. However, these aims are often complicated by difficulties stemming from high-dimensionality, non-normality, sparsity, and the compositional nature of microbiome data sets. A key tool in microbiome analysis is beta diversity, defined by the distances between microbial samples. Many different distance metrics have been proposed, all with varying discriminatory power on data with differing characteristics. Here, we propose a compositional beta diversity metric rooted in a centered log-ratio transformation and matrix completion called robust Aitchison PCA. We demonstrate the benefits of compositional transformations upstream of beta diversity calculations through simulations. Additionally, we demonstrate improved effect size, classification accuracy, and robustness to sequencing depth over the current methods on several decreased sample subsets of real microbiome data sets. Finally, we highlight the ability of this new beta diversity metric to retain the feature loadings linked to sample ordinations revealing salient intercommunity niche feature importance. IMPORTANCE By accounting for the sparse compositional nature of microbiome data sets, robust Aitchison PCA can yield high discriminatory power and salient feature ranking between microbial niches.

  abstract = {Particulate organic carbon fluxes were measured with free-floating particle traps at nine locations during VERTEX and related studies. Examination of these data indicated that there was relatively little spatial variability in open ocean fluxes. To obtain mean rates representative of the oligotrophic environment, flux data from six stations were combined and fitted to a normalized power function, F = F100 (z/100)b; e.g. the open ocean composite C flux in mol m−2 y−1 = 1.53 (z/100−0.858 with depth z in meters. It is shown that the vertical derivative of particulate fluxes may indicate solute regeneration rates, and accordingly regeneration rates for C, H and N were estimated. Oxygen utilization rates were also estimated under the assumption that 1.5, 1.0 and 0.25 moles of O2 were used for each mole of N, C and H regenerated. Regeneration ratios of these elements were depth-dependent: i.e. N:C:H:−O2 = 1.0 N: 6.2 (z/100)0.130 C: 10.0(z/100)0.146 H: [1.5 + 6.2 (z/100)0.130 + 2.5 (z/100)0.146]−O2. Comparisons of our rates with those in the literature indicate that trap-derived new productivities in the open Pacific (≈1.5 mol C m−2 y−1) are substantially less than those estimated from oxygen utilization rates in the Sargasso Sea (≈4 mol C m−2 y−1). A hypothesis is presented which attempts to explain this discrepancy on the basis of the lateral transport and decomposition of slow or non-sinking POC in the Sargasso Sea. Data gathered during the VERTEX studies are also used for various global estimates. Open ocean primary productivities are estimated at 130 g C m−2 y−1 which results in a global open ocean productivity of 42 Gt y−1. Organic C removal from the surface of the ocean via particulate sinking (new production) is on the order of 6 Gt y−1. Fifty percent of this C is regenerated in the upper 300 m of the water column. The ratio of new production (measured with traps) to total primary production (measured via 14C) is 0.14. It is concluded that the 14C technique yields reasonable estimates of primary productivity provided that care is taken to prevent heavy metal contamination.},

Here we tested whether the mechanisms that underlie bacterial β-diversity vary over centimeters to continental spatial scales by comparing the composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria communities in salt marsh sediments. As observed in studies of macroorganisms, the drivers of salt marsh bacterial β-diversity depend on spatial scale. In contrast to macroorganism studies, however, we found no evidence of evolutionary diversification of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria taxa at the continental scale, despite an overall relationship between geographic distance and community similarity. Our data are consistent with the idea that dispersal limitation at local scales can contribute to β-diversity, even though the 16S rRNA genes of the relatively common taxa are globally distributed. These results highlight the importance of considering multiple spatial scales for understanding microbial biogeography.},

  abstract = {To elucidate the fate of mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MMHg) in estuaries we have been studying the biogeochemical cycling of Hg in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Measurements of total Hg and mercury speciation (MMHg and dissolved gaseous Hg (DGHg)) have been made in the surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay system, including sampling transects into Baltimore Harbor, a region where sediment Hg concentrations can exceed 5 nmol g−1 and sediment MMHg concentrations approach 50 pmol g−1. Surface water Hg concentrations are typical of an impacted urban estuary that has a high suspended sediment load (SPM; typically {$>$}5 mg l−1), and for the upper Bay, where total Hg is generally 20 pM or less, particulate Hg is the dominant fraction. Total Hg concentrations tend to decrease down-estuary, and this is also true for the sub-estuaries (Potomac and Patuxent Rivers). This decrease coincides with a decrease in SPM, but urban inputs are also higher up-estuary. Measurement of total Hg and MMHg in the anoxic bottom waters that develop seasonally in the harbor demonstrate the increased concentration of Hg, and especially MMHg, under low oxygen conditions, and the most likely source is the release of these species from sediments. Both intensive studies and long-term measurements show that the concentration of DGHg is relatively low in this system (typically {$<$}0.2 pM) and DGHg is a small fraction of the total Hg. Based on the information available, a preliminary mass balance budget is constructed for the Chesapeake Bay. Direct atmospheric deposition contributes a substantial portion of the Hg to the Bay while sedimentary removal is the principal sink. Overall, 29\% of the riverine and atmospheric inputs to the Bay is exported to the coastal ocean. Thus, the Bay is an efficient trap for Hg. The Bay is, however, a net source of MMHg suggesting that significant methylation of Hg occurs within the estuary. On a watershed scale, only about 5\% of the total atmospheric deposition to the watershed is exported to the coastal ocean.},

Here we investigated the impact of oil deposition on microbial communities in surface sediments collected at 64 sites by targeted sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 14 of these samples and mineralization experiments using 14C-labeled model substrates. The 16S rRNA gene data indicated that the most heavily oil-impacted sediments were enriched in an uncultured Gammaproteobacterium and a Colwellia species, both of which were highly similar to sequences in the DWH deep-sea hydrocarbon plume. The primary drivers in structuring the microbial community were nitrogen and hydrocarbons. Annotation of unassembled metagenomic data revealed the most abundant hydrocarbon degradation pathway encoded genes involved in degrading aliphatic and simple aromatics via butane monooxygenase. The activity of key hydrocarbon degradation pathways by sediment microbes was confirmed by determining the mineralization of 14C-labeled model substrates in the following order: propylene glycol, dodecane, toluene and phenanthrene. Further, analysis of metagenomic sequence data revealed an increase in abundance of genes involved in denitrification pathways in samples that exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s benchmarks for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compared with those that did not. Importantly, these data demonstrate that the indigenous sediment microbiota contributed an important ecosystem service for remediation of oil in the Gulf. However, PAHs were more recalcitrant to degradation, and their persistence could have deleterious impacts on the sediment ecosystem.},

  abstract = {During the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico a deep-sea hydrocarbon plume developed resulting in a rapid succession of bacteria. Colwellia eventually supplanted Oceanospirillales, which dominated the plume early in the spill. These successional changes may have resulted, in part, from the changing composition and abundance of hydrocarbons over time. Colwellia abundance peaked when gaseous and simple aromatic hydrocarbons increased, yet the metabolic pathway used by Colwellia in hydrocarbon disposition is unknown. Here we used single-cell genomics to gain insights into the genome properties of a Colwellia enriched during the DWH deep-sea plume. A single amplified genome (SAG) of a Colwellia cell isolated from a DWH plume, closely related (avg. 98\% 16S rRNA gene similarity) to other plume Colwellia, was sequenced and annotated. The SAG was similar to the sequenced isolate Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H (84\% avg. nucleotide identity). Both had genes for denitrification, chemotaxis, and motility, adaptations to cold environments and a suite of nutrient acquisition genes. The Colwellia SAG may be capable of gaseous and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation, which contrasts with a DWH plume Oceanospirillales SAG which encoded non-gaseous n-alkane and cycloalkane degradation pathways. The disparate hydrocarbon degradation pathways are consistent with hydrocarbons that were abundant at different times in the deep-sea plume; first, non-gaseous n-alkanes and cycloalkanes that could be degraded by Oceanospirillales, followed by gaseous, and simple aromatic hydrocarbons that may have been degraded by Colwellia. These insights into the genomic properties of a Colwellia species, which were supported by existing metagenomic sequence data from the plume and DWH contaminated sediments, help further our understanding of the successional changes in the dominant microbial players in the plume over the course of the DWH spill.},

  abstract = {Extendingy an almost universal observation that the rate of microbial activity increases with temperature, we propose that marine microbial activity was suppressed during previous glacial periods and allowed proportionally more organic carbon to be exported out of the surface ocean. A stronger organic carbon pump and therefore lower rain ratios of CaCO3 to organic carbon may have contributed to the low atmospheric CO2 content during the Last Glacial Maximum. Previous study of temperature-dependent export production (Laws et al., 2000) and our map of data-based, global distribution of the rain ratios lend support to today's rain ratios being controlled at least partly by temperature. A close examination with a high-resolution regional ocean ecosystem model indicates that the correlation between rain ratio and temperature is caused indeed by preferential remineralization of organic matter, but a part of the correlation is also driven by temperature-dependent community composition. An extrapolation of these results to the globe using a global carbon cycle box model with a module for sediments indicates that the drawdown of atmospheric CO2 by the proposed mechanism is approximately 30 ppm. While this estimate is subject to uncertainty, the fact that it represents nearly one third of the glacial-interglacial variation in atmosphere pCO2 suggests the potential importance of the new mechanism. Given the historical difficulty in explaining the full CO2 amplitude with a single cause, we suggest that a set of multiple mechanisms were responsible and that the temperature-dependent POC degradation rate is one of them. We discuss two possible difficulties with our proposal that have to do with the potentially important role that ballasts play in organic carbon export and the possibility that enhanced biological pump is self limiting.},

We propose that studying predation-driven adaptations will provide an exciting frontier for microbial ecology and evolution at the interface of prokaryotes and eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {The relationship between organic carbon (OC) and grain size found in most continental shelf sediments is here reinterpreted in terms of the surface area of the sediments. Cores from many North American shelf environments show downcore decreases in OC to similar refractory background concentrations if expressed relative to the surface area of the sediments. This consistent concentration is 0.86 mg-OC m−2, which is equivalent in concentration to a monolayer of organic matter coating all mineral surfaces. A more global collection of sediment-water interface samples show that this relationship is even more extensive, with exceptions occurring in areas of very high riverine sediment input, organic pollution, or low-oxygen water columns. Density separations indicate that organic matter is largely adsorbed to mineral grains. The microtopography of surfaces was examined with N2 sorption and most surface area was found to be inside pores of {$<$}10 nm width. These data lead to a hypothesis that organic matter is protected by its location inside pores too small to allow functioning of the hydrolytic enzymes necessary for organic matter decay. Such protection would likely work in concert with other protection mechanisms such as humification. This consistent surface area correlation with OC concentration may explain control of spatial and temporal variations in OC burial rates by sedimentation rates; the pore protection hypothesis provides a causal mechanism for this observed control.},

Recent work suggests that the resident zooplankton fragment, rather than ingest, the majority of encountered organic particles, thereby stimulating bacterial proliferation and the deep-ocean microbial food web. Here we speculate that this apparently counterintuitive behaviour is an example of 'microbial gardening', a strategy that exploits the enzymatic and biosynthetic capabilities of microorganisms to facilitate the 'gardener's' access to a suite of otherwise unavailable compounds that are essential for metazoan life. We demonstrate the potential gains that zooplankton stand to make from microbial gardening using a simple steady state model, and we suggest avenues for future research.},

The derived in situ PGE values were on average \textasciitilde 1.4\% (from 0.3\% to 3.7\%), indicating that most of the organic substrates incorporated by prokaryotes were respired instead of being used for growth.

We also found a strong correlation between R and PGE with temperature across a gradient ranging from 8.7 to 14.9 °C.

  abstract = {Work of the last 10 years has demonstrated that oceanic particle size distribution by volume tends to be flat at mid-water depths (equivalent to a cumulative particle number distribution with a slope of −3) and is peaked in nepheloid layers with active resuspension and in surface waters with active biological production. The observed loss of fine peaks from the suspensions to yield flat distributions requires aggregation of the material, as the fines settle slowly. Mechanisms leading to particle collision are examined; for interactions between particles of similar size, Brownian motion dominates below 1.5 to 8 μm. However, if large particles (such as ‘marine snow’) are present at realistic concentrations, they become important in the removal of fine particles by shear-controlled coagulation. The coagulation times calculated for shear are too long for steady state to be presumed while the size distributions evolve under the influence of coagulation mechanisms. Therefore suggestions that the flat size distributions are quasi-stationary results of shear-controlled coagulation are rejected, and the notion that there is sub-equal production of particles at different points in the spectrum is favoured. Such production and the subsequent scavenging of small particles by large settling ones confers great importance on components of biological origin in both providing elements of the total size spectrum and determining the distribution and sedimentation of others of lithogenic origin. In surface waters, filtration rates by zooplankton indicate that aggregation rates of particles above submicron sizes are biologically determined.},

Sizes of suspended material below 200 to 400 m in the oceans follow a hyperbolic distribution with slopes between --2.4 and --3.6. Volume distributions are calculated and converted to mass distributions using an assumed density distribution. Stokes velocities are calculated for particle size classes. Most of the particle flux, the product of settling velocity and mass, is in the coarser size classes. Assumption of steady state requires aggregation of small particles in the upper layers of the ocean to maintain the concentrations of the larger rapidly sinking particles. Current sampling procedures may miss much of the material in rapid vertical transit.},

However, computational methods for analysis of bacterial transcriptome data have not kept pace with the large and growing data sets generated by RNA-seq technology. Here, we present new algorithms, specific to bacterial gene structures and transcriptomes, for analysis of RNA-seq data. The algorithms are implemented in an open source software system called Rockhopper that supports various stages of bacterial RNA-seq data analysis, including aligning sequencing reads to a genome, constructing transcriptome maps, quantifying transcript abundance, testing for differential gene expression, determining operon structures and visualizing results. We demonstrate the performance of Rockhopper using 2.1 billion sequenced reads from 75 RNA-seq experiments conducted with Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pyogenes and Xenorhabdus nematophila. We find that the transcriptome maps generated by our algorithms are highly accurate when compared with focused experimental data from E. coli and N. gonorrhoeae, and we validate our system’s ability to identify novel small RNAs, operons and transcription start sites. Our results suggest that Rockhopper can be used for efficient and accurate analysis of bacterial RNA-seq data, and that it can aid with elucidation of bacterial transcriptomes.},

Microplastic interacts with biota, including microorganisms, in these habitats, raising concerns about its ecological effects. Rivers may transport microplastic to marine habitats and the Great Lakes, but data on microplastic in rivers is limited. In a highly urbanized river in Chicago, Illinois, USA, we measured concentrations of microplastic that met or exceeded those measured in oceans and the Great Lakes, and we demonstrated that wastewater treatment plant effluent was a point source of microplastic. Results from high-throughput sequencing showed that bacterial assemblages colonizing microplastic within the river were less diverse and were significantly different in taxonomic composition compared to those from the water column and suspended organic matter. Several taxa that include plastic decomposing organisms and pathogens were more abundant on microplastic. These results demonstrate that microplastic in rivers are a distinct microbial habitat and may be a novel vector for the downstream transport of unique bacterial assemblages. In addition, this study suggests that urban rivers are an overlooked and potentially significant component of the global microplastic life cycle.},

Paired measurements of polyacrylamide gel traps and the VPR result in depth- and size-resolved parameterizations of the average sinking velocity, which enable the estimation of the flux size distribution from the concentration size distribution. Comparisons between the gel traps and the bulk carbon flux allows for the parameterization of the particle carbon content as a function of size. Together, these parameterizations permit the estimation of carbon fluxes from high-resolution VPR surveys. This method enables greater spatial, vertical, and temporal resolution of flux measurements beyond what is possible with conventional sediment traps. We tested this method in the Sargasso Sea and found that it was capable of accurately reproducing the fluxes measured in sediment traps while offering substantial improvement in the accuracy of the estimated fluxes compared to previous global and regional parameterizations. Our results point to the importance of local calibrations of the average sinking velocity and particle carbon content when estimating carbon fluxes from measurement of the concentration size distribution. This method holds important oceanographic potential for elucidating regional or basin scale carbon flows and providing new mechanistic insights into the function of the biological pump.},

  abstract = {Marine particles play a central role in controlling the transport, cycling, and inventories of many major elements and trace elements and isotopes throughout the oceans. Studies seeking to elucidate the biogeochemical roles of marine particles often require reliable ways to collect them from the ocean. Here, we review the oceanographic toolbox of techniques and instrumentation that are employed to collect both suspended and sinking particles. With these tools, it is possible to determine both the concentrations and vertical fluxes of important elements and individual particle types. We describe the various methods for quantifying the concentrations of particulate matter with in situ pumps, towed sampling devices, bottle collectors, and large volume capture devices. The uses of various types of flux collection platforms are discussed including surface tethered, neutrally buoyant, and bottom moored devices. We address the issues of sediment trap collection biases and the apparent inconsistencies that can arise due to differences in the temporal and spatial scales sampled by the various methodologies. Special attention is given to collection considerations made for the analysis of trace metals and isotopes, as these methodologies are of high importance to the ongoing GEOTRACES program which seeks to identify the processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean. With the emergence of new particle collection methodologies and the continued reliance on traditional collection methods, it is imperative that we combine these multiple approaches in ways that will help improve their accuracy and precision while enhancing their utility in advancing understanding of the biogeochemical and ecological roles of marine particles.},

Here we describe a previously unrecognized effect of biodiversity on ecosystem predictability, where predictability is inversely related to temporal and spatial variation in ecosystem properties. By manipulating biodiversity in aquatic microbial communities, we show that one process, ecosystem respiration, becomes more predictable as biodiversity increases. Analysis of similar patterns extracted from other studies indicates that biodiversity also enhances predictability in terrestrial ecosystems. Biodiversity can also affect average levels of ecosystem performance, but the extent to which different species make unique or redundant contributions to ecosystem processes remains controversial. Nonlinear effects of biodiversity on the decomposition of particulate organic matter and resistance of communities to invasion indicate that different species have redundant functions in our system. The consequences of biodiversity are also not restricted to early successional situations as described in previous studies, because strong effects persist even after ecosystems develop for periods corresponding to 40–80 generations of dominant organisms.},

  abstract = {For cognitive neuroscience to go forward a more explicit effort is needed to use neurophysiology to constrain how the brain produces human mental functions. This review begins with the suggestion that two fundamental features may be critical for this effort. The first is the connectivity of the brain, which occupies an intermediate position between complete redundant interconnections and independence. The term semniconnected is presented as a designation, which is an obvious derivation of the term semiconductors as used in engineering. The second is transient response plasticity where a given neuron or collection of neurons may show rapid changes in response characteristics depending on experience. Response plasticity is a ubiquitous property of the brain rather than a unique characteristic of "neurocognitive" regions. These two properties may be brought together when brain areas interact such that their aggregate function embodies cognition. Three examples are used to illustrate these general principles and to develop the idea that a particular region in isolation may not act as a reliable index for a particular cognitive function. Instead, the neural context in which an area is active may define the cognitive function. Neural context emphasizes that the particular spatiotemporal pattern of neural interactions may hold the key to bridge between brain and mind.},

  abstract = {Western Lake Erie (Laurentian Great Lakes) is prone to annual cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) dominated by Microcystis spp. that often yield microcystin toxin concentrations exceeding the federal EPA recreational contact advisory of 8 μg liter−1. In August 2014, microcystin levels were detected in finished drinking water above the World Health Organization 1.0 μg liter−1 threshold for consumption, leading to a 2-day disruption in the supply of drinking water for {$>$}400,000 residents of Toledo, Ohio (USA). Subsequent metatranscriptomic analysis of the 2014 bloom event provided evidence that release of toxin into the water supply was likely caused by cyanophage lysis that transformed a portion of the intracellular microcystin pool into the dissolved fraction, rendering it more difficult to eliminate during treatment. In August 2019, a similar increase in dissolved microcystins at the Toledo water intake was coincident with a viral lytic event caused by a phage consortium different in composition from what was detected following the 2014 Toledo water crisis. The most abundant viral sequence in metagenomic data sets was a scaffold from a putative member of the Siphoviridae, distinct from the Ma-LMM01-like Myoviridae that are typically documented to occur in western Lake Erie. This study provides further evidence that viral activity in western Lake Erie plays a significant role in transformation of microcystins from the particulate to the dissolved fraction and therefore requires monitoring efforts from local water treatment plants. Additionally, identification of multiple lytic cyanophages will enable the development of a quantitative PCR toolbox to assess viral activity during cHABs. IMPORTANCE Viral attack on cHABs may contribute to changes in community composition during blooms, as well as bloom decline, yet loss of bloom biomass does not eliminate the threat of cHAB toxicity. Rather, it may increase risks to the public by delivering a pool of dissolved toxin directly into water treatment utilities when the dominating Microcystis spp. are capable of producing microcystins. Detecting, characterizing, and quantifying the major cyanophages involved in lytic events will assist water treatment plant operators in making rapid decisions regarding the pool of microcystins entering the plant and the corresponding best practices to neutralize the toxin.},

  abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are common in Monterey Bay, CA, and have resulted in repeated closures of shellfish fisheries and the poisoning and death of marine mammals. In the majority of instances, HAB events in this region are first detected by the presence of sick or dying animals. The phrase “cryptic blooms” was adopted to denote the appearance of poisoning at higher trophic levels with no prior evidence of a large phytoplankton bloom. We hypothesize that the onset of many HAB events goes undetected because the bloom is initially concentrated in discrete thin subsurface layers in the water column that are easily missed by conventional sampling and monitoring methods. In this paper, we report on the detection and monitoring of a subsurface layer of phytoplankton in northern Monterey Bay, CA, using a high-resolution, autonomous profiler. This ‘thin layer,’ which measured from 10~cm to 3~m in thickness (85\%\,{$<$}\,2~m; 54\%\,{$<$}\,1~m), persisted over a 7-day period near the base of the pycnocline. The phytoplankton assemblage in the layer was primarily composed of a multi-species assemblage of Pseudo-nitzschia including the toxin-producing species Pseudo-nitzschia australis. Concentrations of toxic phytoplankton (P. australis), cyanobacteria, and bacteria in the layer were significantly higher than outside the layer (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Counts of total Pseudo-nitzschia spp. showed similar levels of enrichment in the layer compared to outside the layer. Our findings indicate that, when monitoring for HABs, it is critical to sample at scales appropriate to resolve thin layers. Thin layers have been identified as a common recurrent feature in a variety of coastal systems, suggesting that the use of autonomous high-resolution vertical profilers coupled with targeted sampling, could allow more timely detection of HABs in many coastal environments.},

  abstract = {Background The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. Conclusions The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) amplicon sequencing comprehensively profiles microbiomes, but results will only be accurate if PCR primers perfectly match environmental sequences. To evaluate whether primers commonly used in microbial oceanography match naturally-occurring organisms, we compared primers with \&gt; 300 million rRNA sequences retrieved from globally-distributed metagenomes. The best-performing 16S primers were 515Y/926R and 515Y/806RB which perfectly matched most sequences (\textasciitilde 0.95). Considering Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast 16S, 515Y/926R had the highest coverage (0.99), making it ideal for quantifying phytoplankton. For 18S sequences, 515Y/926R performed best (0.88), followed by V4R/V4RB (18S-specific; 0.82). Using Atlantic and Pacific BioGEOTRACES field samples, we demonstrate high correspondence between 515Y/926R amplicons (generated as part of this study) and metagenomic 16S rRNA (median R\textsuperscript{2}=0.98, n=272), indicating amplicons can produce equally accurate community composition data versus shotgun metagenomics.

In order to maximize this procedure’s effectiveness, it is essential that environmental organisms match PCR primer sequences exactly. In this study, we developed a software pipeline to evaluate how well commonly-used primers match primer-binding regions from globally-distributed short-read oceanic metagenomes. Our results demonstrate common primer sets vary widely in performance, and that including additional degenerate bases is a simple strategy to maximize environmental coverage. Written in the reproducible snakemake workflow language and publicly accessible, our pipeline provides a general-purpose tool to guide rational design of PCR primers for any environment with metagenomic data.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Analysts screened these studies to find those that (a) contrasted an online to a face-to-face condition, (b) measured student learning outcomes, (c) used a rigorous research design, and (d) provided adequate information to calculate an effect size. As a result of this screening, 51 independent effects were identified that could be subjected to meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found that, on average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction. The difference between student outcomes for online and face-to-face classes—measured as the difference between treatment and control means, divided by the pooled standard deviation—was larger in those studies contrasting conditions that blended elements of online and face-to-face instruction with conditions taught entirely face-to-face. Analysts noted that these blended conditions often included additional learning time and instructional elements not received by students in control conditions. This finding suggests that the positive effects associated with blended learning should not be attributed to the media, per se. An unexpected finding was the small number of rigorous published studies contrasting online and face-to-face learning conditions for K–12 students. In light of this small corpus, caution is required in generalizing to the K–12 population because the results are derived for the most part from studies in other settings (e.g., medical training, higher education).},

The number of individuals involved in an invasion provides a strong theoretical basis for determining the likelihood of establishment of an alien species. * 2Here a field experiment was used to manipulate the critical first stages of the invasion of an alien insect, a psyllid weed biocontrol agent, Arytainilla spartiophila Förster, in New Zealand and to observe the progress of the invasion over the following 6 years. * 3Fifty-five releases were made along a linear transect 135~km long: 10 releases of two, four, 10, 30 and 90 psyllids and five releases of 270 psyllids. Six years after their original release, psyllids were present in 22 of the 55 release sites. Analysis by logistic regression showed that the probability of establishment was significantly and positively related to initial release size, but that this effect was important only during the psyllids’ first year in the field. * 4Although less likely to establish, some of the releases of two and four psyllids did survive 5 years in the field. Overall, releases that survived their first year had a 96\% chance of surviving thereafter, providing the release site remained secure. The probability of colony loss due to site destruction remained the same throughout the experiment, whereas the probability of natural extinction reduced steeply over time. * 5During the first year colonies were undergoing a process of establishment and, in most cases, population size decreased. After this first year, a period of exponential growth ensued. * 6A lag period was observed before the populations increased dramatically in size. This was thought to be due to inherent lags caused by the nature of population growth, which causes the smaller releases to appear to have a longer lag period.},

Previous studies of photoinhibition have been restricted to bacterial ammonia oxidizers, rather than archaeal ammonia oxidizers, which dominate in marine environments. To compare the photoinhibition of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers, specific growth rates of two ammonia-oxidizing archaea (Nitrosopumilus maritimus and Nitrosotalea devanaterra) and bacteria (Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrosospira multiformis) were determined at different light intensities under continuous illumination and light/dark cycles. All strains were inhibited by continuous illumination at the highest intensity (500 similar to mu E similar to m-2 similar to s-1). At lower light intensities, archaeal growth was much more photosensitive than bacterial growth, with greater inhibition at 60 similar to mu E similar to m-2 similar to s-1 than at 15 similar to mu E similar to m-2 similar to s-1, where bacteria were unaffected. Archaeal ammonia oxidizers were also more sensitive to cycles of 8-h light/16-h darkness at two light intensities (60 and 15 similar to mu E similar to m-2 similar to s-1) and, unlike bacterial strains, showed no evidence of recovery during dark phases. The findings provide evidence for niche differentiation in aquatic environments and reduce support for photoinhibition as an explanation of nitrite maxima in the ocean.},

Three types of current measurement are considered. First, by comparing the difference between successive GPS positions, obtained when the glider surfaces, and dead-reckoned displacements when the glider is submerged, it is possible to estimate depth averaged horizontal currents and also surface drift. Second, our gliders were equipped with Conductivity Temperature Depth sensors, which provided data used to calculate geostrophic horizontal velocity. Third, from the measured rate of change of pressure it is possible to quantify the vertical water velocity as the difference between the measurement and the expected vertical motion. The latter two both require a model of the glider motion, which we outline. Horizontal currents of the order of 30 cm/s were measured in the westward flowing Northern Current off the south coast of France, with a width and transport comparable with previous observations using different technologies. The accuracy of the depth-averaged currents in magnitude and direction was limited by the accuracy of the measured heading of the glider. Measurements of vertical velocity were made during a time of active convection when the magnitude of the vertical motion was up to 10 cm/s. We estimate that the accuracy of the calculated velocity was of the order of 1 cm/s.},

  abstract = {Depending on their relationship with the pelagic particulate matter, planktonic prokaryotes have traditionally been classified into two types of communities: free-living (FL) or attached (ATT) to particles, and are generally separated using only one pore-size filter in a differential filtration. Nonetheless, particulate matter in the oceans appears in a continuum of sizes. Here we separated this continuum into six discrete size-fractions, from 0.2 to 200 μm, and described the prokaryotes associated to each of them. Each size-fraction presented different bacterial communities, with a range of 23–42\% of unique (OTUs) in each size-fraction, supporting the idea that they contained distinct types of particles. An increase in richness was observed from the smallest to the largest size-fractions, suggesting that increasingly larger particles contributed new niches. Our results show that a multiple size-fractionation provides a more exhaustive description of the bacterial diversity and community structure than the use of only one filter. In addition, and based on our results, we propose an alternative to the dichotomy of FL or ATT lifestyles, in which we differentiate the taxonomic groups with preference for the smaller fractions, those that do not show preferences for small or large fractions, and those that preferentially appear in larger fractions.},

  abstract = {The sinking of organic particles formed in the photic layer is a main vector of carbon export into the deep ocean. Although sinking particles are heavily colonized by microbes, so far it has not been explored whether this process plays a role in transferring prokaryotic diversity from surface to deep oceanic layers. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we explore here the vertical connectivity of the ocean microbiome by characterizing marine prokaryotic communities associated with five different size fractions and examining their compositional variability from surface down to 4,000 m across eight stations sampled in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans during the Malaspina 2010 Expedition. Our results show that the most abundant prokaryotes in the deep ocean are also present in surface waters. This vertical community connectivity seems to occur predominantly through the largest particles because communities in the largest size fractions showed the highest taxonomic similarity throughout the water column, whereas free-living communities were more isolated vertically. Our results further suggest that particle colonization processes occurring in surface waters determine to some extent the composition and biogeography of bathypelagic communities. Overall, we postulate that sinking particles function as vectors that inoculate viable particle-attached surface microbes into the deep-sea realm, determining to a considerable extent the structure, functioning, and biogeography of deep ocean communities.},

  abstract = {The North Atlantic Ocean receives the largest allochthonous supplies of nitrogen of any ocean basin because of the close proximity of industrialized nations. In this paper, we describe the major standing stocks, fluxes and transformations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the pelagic regions of the North Atlantic, as one part of a larger effort to understand the entire N and P budgets in the North Atlantic Ocean, its watersheds and overlying atmosphere. The primary focus is on nitrogen, however, we consider both nitrogen and phosphorus because of the close inter-relationship between the N and P cycles in the ocean. The oceanic standing stocks of N and P are orders of magnitude larger than the annual amount transported off continents or deposited from the atmosphere. Atmospheric deposition can have an impact on oceanic nitrogen cycling at locations near the coasts where atmospheric sources are large, or in the centers of the highly stratified gyres where little nitrate is supplied to the surface by vertical mixing of the ocean. All of the reactive nitrogen transported to the coasts in rivers is denitrified or buried in the estuaries or on the continental shelves and an oceanic source of nitrate of 0.7-0.95 x 10(12) moles NO3- y(-1) is required to supply the remainder of the shelf denitrification (Nixon et al., this volume). The horizontal fluxes of nitrate caused by the ocean circulation are both large and uncertain. Even the sign of the transport across the equator is uncertain and this precludes a conclusion on whether the North Atlantic Ocean as a whole is a net source or sink of nitrate. We identify a source of nitrate of 3.7-6.4 x 10(12) moles NO3- y(-1) within the main thermocline of the Sargasso Sea that we infer is caused by nitrogen fixation. This nitrate source may explain the nitrate divergence observed by Rintoul \& Wunsch (1991) in the mid-latitude gyre. The magnitude of nitrogen fixation inferred from this nitrate source would exceed previous estimates of global nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation requires substantial quantities of iron as a micro-nutrient and the calculated iron requirement is comparable to the rates supplied by the deposition of iron associated with Saharan dust. Interannual variability in dust inputs is large and could cause comparable signals in the nitrogen fixation rate. The balance of the fluxes across the basin boundaries suggest that the total stocks of nitrate and phosphate in the North Atlantic may be increasing on time-scales of centuries. Some of the imbalance is related to the inferred nitrogen fixation in the gyre and the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, both of which may be influenced by human activities. However, the fluxes of dissolved organic nutrients are almost completely unknown and they have the potential to alter our perception of the overall mass balance of the North Atlantic Ocean.},

  abstract = {Seasonal patterns in hydrography, oxygen, nutrients, particulate carbon and nitrogen and pigments were measured on monthly cruises at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study site, 80 km southeast of Bermuda. Between October 1988 and September 1990, the annual cycle was defined by the creation of 160–230 m-deep mixed layers in February of each year and a transition to strong thermal stratification in summer and fall. The 230 m mixed layer in February 1989 resulted in mixed-layer nitrate concentrations of 0.5–1.0 μmole kg−1, carbon fixation rates over 800 mg C m−2 day−1, and a phytoplankton bloom with chlorophyll concentrations over 0.4 mg m−3. Chlorophyll a, particulate organic matter, inorganic nutrients and primary production had returned to prebloom levels the following month with the exception of a chlorophyll maximum layer at 100 m. Particle fluxes at 150 m in February 1989 reached 56 mg C m−2 day−1 and 11 mg N m−2 day−1 (0.77 mmole N m−2 day−1). Estimates of new production during the bloom period calculated from changes in oxygen and nitrate profiles ranged from 100 to 240 mmoles N m−2, significantly higher than the sediment trap fluxes and approaching the measured total production rates. In spring of 1990, mixed layer depths did not exceed 160 m, nitrate was rarely detectable in the upper euphotic zone, chlorophyll a concentrations were similar to 1989, and particulate organic matter concentrations were lower. The period of elevated biomass lasted for 3 months in 1990, and phytoplankton pigment composition varied between cruises. The average rates of primary production and particle flux were higher in 1990 than those measured in the spring of 1989, despite the differences in mixed layer depth. Throughout both years, NO3 : PO4 ratios in the upper thermocline exceeded Redfield ratios. The maintenance of this pattern requires a net uptake of PO4 between 150 and 250 m, a depth range usually associated with net remineralization. The exact mechanism that maintains elevated PO4 uptake and its implication for the nutrient supply to the euphotic zone remain unknown.},

  abstract = {In the framework of the “Ice Station POLarstern” (ISPOL) expedition in the western Weddell Sea, two sediment traps were deployed at 10 and 70 m water depth under a drifting ice floe in December 2004. The amount and composition of the vertical particle flux under sea ice were determined during a period of 30 days in order to investigate the influence of biological processes in sea ice and on its underside on the flux. The total mass flux was dominated by diatoms, faecal material, and aggregates, and ranged from 95.28 to 197.67 mg m−2 d−1 at 10 m depth and from 51.54 to 55.34 mg m−2 d−1 at 70 m depth. A strong increase with time of the flux of chlorophyll equivalents, biogenic silica, and faecal material was recorded during the observation period, coincident with the increase in the concentration of chlorophyll a in the bottom ice layer above the trap array. The latter suggests a concomitant increase in the amount of food available for grazers, such as krill, in the bottom ice layer and on the underside of the ice floe, resulting in an increased downward transport of ice-algal material into the water column. The sinking faecal material was dominated by krill faecal strings and contained large amounts of diatom frustule debris, as well as intact diatom frustules, mainly of the species Fragilariopsis curta and F. cylindrus. Single pronounced flux events of Phaeocystis antarctica and aggregates were also observed early in the study period. Low POC/PON and biogenic silica/POC ratios of the sinking particulate matter suggest that the material collected in the traps was relatively fresh.},

  abstract = {Genetic, structural and physiological differences between strains of the marine bacterium Cellulophaga baltica MM\#3 (Flavobacteriaceae) developing in response to the activity of two virulent bacteriophages, ΦSM and ΦST, was investigated during 3~weeks incubation in chemostat cultures. A distinct strain succession towards increased phage resistance and a diversification of the metabolic properties was observed. During the incubation the bacterial population diversified from a single strain, which was sensitive to 24 tested Cellulophaga phages, into a multistrain and multiresistant population, where the dominant strains had lost susceptibility to up to 22 of the tested phages. By the end of the experiment the cultures reached a quasi steady state dominated by ΦST-resistant and ΦSM~+~ΦST-resistant strains coexisting with small populations of phage-sensitive strains sustaining both phages at densities of {$>~$}106 plaque forming units (pfu)~ml−1. Loss of susceptibility to phage infection was associated with a reduction in the strains' ability to metabolize various carbon sources as demonstrated by BIOLOG assays. This suggested a cost of resistance in terms of reduced physiological capacity. However, there was no direct correlation between the degree of resistance and the loss of metabolic properties, suggesting either the occurrence of compensatory mutations in successful strains or that the cost of resistance in some strains was associated with properties not resolved by the BIOLOG assay. The study represents the first direct demonstration of phage-driven generation of functional diversity within a marine bacterial host population with significant implications for both phage susceptibility and physiological properties. We propose, therefore, that phage-mediated selection for resistant strains contributes significantly to the extensive microdiversity observed within specific bacterial species in marine environments.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study a population balance equation (PBE) where flocs are distributed into classes according to their mass. Each class i contains i primary particles with mass m p and size L p. All differently sized flocs can aggregate, binary breakup into two equally sized flocs is used, and the floc’s fractal dimension is d 0 = 2, independently of their size. The collision efficiency is kept constant, and the collision frequency derived by Saffman and Turner (J Fluid Mech 1:16–30, 1956) is used. For the breakup rate, the formulation by Winterwerp (J Hydraul Eng Res 36(3):309–326, 1998), which accounts for the porosity of flocs, is used. We show that the mean floc size computed with the PBE varies with the shear rate as the Kolmogorov microscale, as observed both in laboratory and in situ. Moreover, the equilibrium mean floc size varies linearly with a global parameter P which is proportional to the ratio between the rates of aggregation and breakup. The ratio between the parameters of aggregation and breakup can therefore be estimated analytically from the observed equilibrium floc size. The parameter for aggregation can be calibrated from the temporal evolution of the mean floc size. We calibrate the PBE model using mixing jar flocculation experiments, see Mietta et al. (J Colloid Interface Sci 336(1):134–141, 2009a, Ocean Dyn 59:751–763, 2009b) for details. We show that this model can reproduce the experimental data fairly accurately. The collision efficiency α and the ratio between parameters for aggregation and breakup α and E are shown to decrease linearly with increasing absolute value of the ζ-potential, both for mud and kaolinite suspensions. Suspensions at high pH and different dissolved salt type and concentration have been used. We show that the temporal evolution of the floc size distribution computed with this PBE is very similar to that computed with the PBE developed by Verney et al. (Cont Shelf Res, 2010) where classes are distributed following a geometrical series and mass conservation is statistically ensured. The same terms for aggregation and breakup are used in the two PBEs. Moreover, we argue, using both PBEs, that bimodal distributions become monomodal in a closed system with homogeneous sediment, even when a variable shear rate is applied.},

  abstract = {1. Viruses in aquatic ecosystems can alter the abundance of bacteria and influence organic matter flows and bacterial community composition, but the combined effects of the multiple processes involved in the bacteria-mediated carbon cycle are not entirely clear. 2. We developed a new conceptual model that incorporates a fundamental but neglected aspect of bacteria–organic matter interactions: that different bacterial groups utilize different kinds of organic matter. In addition, the model incorporates several other realistic features of microbial food webs, including the presence of lysogenic viruses, bacterial resistance to viral infection and dependence of protozoan grazing rate on viral infection. 3. Our model analysis indicates that a ‘viral shunt’ view (i.e. viruses enhance bacterial utilization of organic carbon through regeneration of organic matter but diminish carbon flow to higher trophic levels) is robust, regardless of the specific situations we examined by either incorporating or ignoring various features of microbial food webs. 4. We also found that host-specific mortality induced by viral infection changes the bacterial utilization of different types of organic matter, which was attributable to diminished ‘apparent competition’ between predator-sharing bacterial groups that use different carbon sources. This mechanism can facilitate transformation to carbon dioxide of diverse types of carbon sources (e.g. organic matter of algal and terrestrial origin, methane or xenobiotics) and extends the previously recognized roles of viruses in microbial food webs.},

  abstract = {Measurements of floc sizes, floc settling velocities and effective floc densities were obtained at three locations on the inner Adriatic shelf (Italy) in February and May/June 2003 using the in situ size and settling column tripod INSSECT (Mikkelsen et al., 2004. INSSECT—an instrument platform for investigating floc properties close to the seabed. Limnology and Oceanography: Methods 2, 226–236). Measurements were carried out in a water depth of 8–12m and the final data set comprised 2491 flocs. Relationships of observed floc size vs. floc settling velocity and floc size vs. effective floc density were similar to those observed by other authors working in similar settings. The raw data showed significant scatter around mean trends, indicating that only a relatively small fraction of variability in floc settling velocity and effective floc density was explained by floc size. For bin-averaged data, however, much of the variability in settling velocity and density was explained by floc size. On the Adriatic shelf mean floc settling velocities varied from 0.48 to 1.35mms−1, while mean effective floc densities varied from 8.1 to 27.5kgm−3; within the range reported by other authors. Analysis of variance showed significant differences in floc settling velocities, effective floc densities and floc size in space and time (seasons). Thus, floc settling velocities, effective floc densities and floc size on the inner Adriatic shelf could not be characterized by a common mean, but were more appropriately characterized by a range of values, varying in time and space.},

  abstract = {“Super-blooms” of cyanobacteria that produce potent and environmentally persistent biotoxins (microcystins) are an emerging global health issue in freshwater habitats. Monitoring of the marine environment for secondary impacts has been minimal, although microcystin-contaminated freshwater is known to be entering marine ecosystems. Here we confirm deaths of marine mammals from microcystin intoxication and provide evidence implicating land-sea flow with trophic transfer through marine invertebrates as the most likely route of exposure. This hypothesis was evaluated through environmental detection of potential freshwater and marine microcystin sources, sea otter necropsy with biochemical analysis of tissues and evaluation of bioaccumulation of freshwater microcystins by marine invertebrates. Ocean discharge of freshwater microcystins was confirmed for three nutrient-impaired rivers flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and microcystin concentrations up to 2,900 ppm (2.9 million ppb) were detected in a freshwater lake and downstream tributaries to within 1 km of the ocean. Deaths of 21 southern sea otters, a federally listed threatened species, were linked to microcystin intoxication. Finally, farmed and free-living marine clams, mussels and oysters of species that are often consumed by sea otters and humans exhibited significant biomagnification (to 107 times ambient water levels) and slow depuration of freshwater cyanotoxins, suggesting a potentially serious environmental and public health threat that extends from the lowest trophic levels of nutrient-impaired freshwater habitat to apex marine predators. Microcystin-poisoned sea otters were commonly recovered near river mouths and harbors and contaminated marine bivalves were implicated as the most likely source of this potent hepatotoxin for wild otters. This is the first report of deaths of marine mammals due to cyanotoxins and confirms the existence of a novel class of marine “harmful algal bloom” in the Pacific coastal environment; that of hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning (HSP), suggesting that animals and humans are at risk from microcystin poisoning when consuming shellfish harvested at the land-sea interface.},

Seawater supplemented with humic substances was exposed to alternating cycles of sunlight (equivalent to 8 h of midday sun) and dark incubations with natural bacterial populations (1-2 weeks in length). Photochemical degradation of the DOM was monitored during sunlight exposure by direct measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and carbon monoxide (CO) formation in 0.2-μ m filtered seawater. Bacterial degradation was monitored during dark incubations by tritiated leucine uptake and changes in bacterial numbers in bacterivore-free incubations and by direct measurements of DOM loss. The alternating cycles of sunlight and microbial activity resulted in more complete degradation of bulk DOM and marine humic substances than was found for nonirradiated controls (i.e. with microbial activity alone) by a factor of up to 3-fold. Increased decomposition was due both to direct losses of carbon gas photoproducts (DIC and CO in a 15:1 ratio) and to enhanced microbial degradation of photodegraded DOM, with approximately equal contributions from each pathway. Mass balance calculations indicated that low-molecular-weight carbon photoproducts, currently considered to be the compounds responsible for stimulating bacterial activity following photodegradation of DOM, were insufficient to account for the enhanced bacterial production observed. Thus, higher molecular weight, chemically uncharacterized fractions of DOM may also be modified to more biologically available forms during exposure to natural sunlight.},

  abstract = {Direct examination of natural and engineered environments has revealed that the majority of microorganisms in these systems live in structured communities termed biofilms. To gain a better understanding for how biofilms function and interact with their local environment, fundamental capabilities for enhanced visualization, compositional analysis, and functional characterization of biofilms are needed. For pore-scale and community-scale analysis (100’s of nm to 10’s of microns), a variety of surface tools are available. However, understanding biofilm structure in complex three-dimensional (3-D) environments is considerably more difficult. X-ray microtomography can reveal a biofilm’s internal structure, but obtaining sufficient contrast to image low atomic number (Z) biological material against a higher-Z substrate makes detecting biofilms difficult. Here we present results imaging Shewanella oneidensis biofilms on a Hollow-fiber Membrane Biofilm Reactor (HfMBR), using the x-ray microtomography system at sector 2-BM of the Advanced Photon Source (APS), at energies ranging from 12.9-15.4 keV and pixel sizes of 0.7 and 1.3 μm/pixel. We examine the use of osmium (Os) as a contrast agent to enhance biofilm visibility and demonstrate that staining improves imaging of hydrated biofilms. We also present results using a Talbot interferometer to provide phase and scatter contrast information in addition to absorption. Talbot interferometry allows imaging of unstained hydrated biofilms with phase contrast, while absorption contrast primarily highlights edges and scatter contrast provides little information. However, the gratings used here limit the spatial resolution to no finer than 2 μm, which hinders the ability to detect small features. Future studies at higher resolution or higher Talbot order for greater sensitivity to density variations may improve imaging.}

Across all global regions affected by the pandemic, an elevated risk of severe outcomes has consistently been observed in older age groups. Using age-specific mortality patterns in tandem with demographic data, we map a projection of the cumulative burden of COVID-19 and the associated cumulative burden on the healthcare system at the county-scale in the United States for a scenario in which 20\% of the population of each county acquires infection.

We develop and test a mathematical model for predicting the effects of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) on growth, reproduction, and survival using laboratory experiments on fish and shrimp. The exposure-effects model simulates the hourly reductions in growth and survival, and the reduction in reproduction (fecundity) at times of spawning, of an individual as it is exposed to constant or hourly fluctuating dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. The model was applied to seven experiments involving fish and shrimp that included constant and fluctuating DO exposures, with constant exposures used for parameter estimation and the model then used to simulate the growth, reproduction, and survival in the fluctuating treatments. Cumulative effects on growth, reproduction, and survival were predicted well by the model, but the model did not replay the observed episodic low survival days. Further investigation should involve the role of acclimation, possible inclusion of repair effects in reproduction and survival, and the sensitivity of model predictions to the shape of the immediate effects function. Additional testing of the model with other taxa, different patterns of fluctuating exposures, and different stressors is needed to determine the model's generality and robustness.},

  abstract = {Quorum sensing is the regulation of gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density. Quorum sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers that increase in concentration as a function of cell density. The detection of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of an autoinducer leads to an alteration in gene expression. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing communication circuits to regulate a diverse array of physiological activities. These processes include symbiosis, virulence, competence, conjugation, antibiotic production, motility, sporulation, and biofilm formation. In general, Gram-negative bacteria use acylated homoserine lactones as autoinducers, and Gram-positive bacteria use processed oligo-peptides to communicate. Recent advances in the field indicate that cell-cell communication via autoinducers occurs both within and between bacterial species. Furthermore, there is mounting data suggesting that bacterial autoinducers elicit specific responses from host organisms. Although the nature of the chemical signals, the signal relay mechanisms, and the target genes controlled by bacterial quorum sensing systems differ, in every case the ability to communicate with one another allows bacteria to coordinate the gene expression, and therefore the behavior, of the entire community. Presumably, this process bestows upon bacteria some of the qualities of higher organisms. The evolution of quorum sensing systems in bacteria could, therefore, have been one of the early steps in the development of multicellularity.},

In the metagenomic investigation of the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina, we uncovered seven bacterial genomes associated with a single B. neritina individual that appeared to be transient associates, two of which were unique to one individual and undetectable using certain “universal” 16S rRNA primers and probes. We recovered high quality genome assemblies for several rare instances of “microbial dark matter,” or phylogenetically divergent bacteria lacking genomes in reference databases, from a single tissue sample that was not subjected to any physical or chemical pre-treatment. One of these rare, divergent organisms has a small (593 kbp), poorly annotated genome with low GC content (20.9\%) and a 16S rRNA gene with just 65\% sequence similarity to the closest reference sequence. Our findings illustrate the importance of sampling strategy and de novo assembly of metagenomic reads to understand the extent and function of bacterial biodiversity.},

To further characterize nitrification in the marine environment and explore the potential crenarchaeal contribution to this process, we quantified putative nitrifying genes and phylotypes in picoplankton genomic libraries and environmental DNA samples from coastal and open ocean habitats. Betaproteobacteria ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene copy numbers were low or undetectable, in stark contrast to crenarchaeal amoA-like genes that were broadly distributed and reached up to 6 × 104 copies ml−1. Unexpectedly, in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, a deeply branching crenarchaeal group related to a hot spring clade (pSL12) was at times abundant below the euphotic zone. Quantitative data suggested that the pSL12 relatives also contain archaeal amoA-like genes. In both coastal and open ocean habitats, close relatives of known nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospina species were well represented in genomic DNA libraries and quantitative PCR profiles. Planktonic Nitrospina depth distributions correlated with those of Crenarchaea. Overall, the data suggest that amoA-containing Crenarchaea are more phylogenetically diverse than previously reported. Additionally, distributional patterns of planktonic Crenarchaea and Nitrospina species suggest potential metabolic interactions between these groups in the ocean's water column.},

In this research, phosphate oxygen isotope ratios and Bayesian modeling on fingerprinting elements were applied as two novel methods to identify sources and relative recalcitrancy of particulate P pools suspended in water in the continuum of sources from land to the mouth of a coastal estuary to the Chesapeake Bay. Comparative analyses of sizes, relative ratios, and oxygen isotope values of particulate P pools in the creek water suggested that the NaHCO3−P pool was bioavailable, whereas NaOH−P and HCl−P pools were recalcitrant during P transport along the creek. Agricultural field soil, streambank, and river bottom sediments were major sources of particulate P and their contributions varied significantly at the headwater and downstream regions of the creek. Bayesian modeling based on fingerprinting elements suggested that tides played a major role in forming particulate matter from estuarine sources at the creek mouth region and importing it upstream. These findings provide new insights into the origin and fate of particulate P and the fidelity of isotope and fingerprinting methods in source tracking of P in tidally influenced watersheds.},

  abstract = {Many high-throughput sequencing data sets in biology are compositional in nature. A prominent example is microbiome profiling data, including targeted amplicon-based and metagenomic sequencing data. These profiling data comprises surveys of microbial communities in their natural habitat and sparse proportional (or compositional) read counts that represent operational taxonomic units or genes. When paired measurements of other covariates, including physicochemical properties of the habitat or phenotypic variables of the host, are available, inference of parsimonious and robust statistical relationships between the microbial abundance data and the covariate measurements is often an important first step in exploratory data analysis. To this end, we propose a sparse robust statistical regression framework that considers compositional and non-compositional measurements as predictors and identifies outliers in continuous response variables. Our model extends the seminal log-contrast model of Aitchison and Bacon-Shone (1984) by a mean shift formulation for capturing outliers, sparsity-promoting convex and non-convex penalties for parsimonious model selection, and data-driven robust initialization procedures adapted to the compositional setting. We show, in theory and simulations, the ability of our approach to jointly select a sparse set of predictive microbial features and identify outliers in the response. We illustrate the viability of our method by robustly predicting human body mass indices from American Gut Project amplicon data and non-compositional covariate data. We believe that the robust estimators introduced here and available in the R package RobRegCC can serve as a practical tool for reliable statistical regression analysis of compositional data, including microbiome survey data.},

  abstract = {The vertical distribution of bacterial abundance and chlorophyll a was examined at the centimeter scale with a high resolution sampler and the variation at this scale compared to the variation across the entire water column. Samples were taken near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, USA, in the coastal Atlantic environment as part of the MECCAS (Microbial Exchanges and Couplings in Coastal Atlantic Systems) program. Bacterial abundance changed up to 5.1 times over the entire water column, while changing up to 3.5 times over 10 cm. Chlorophyll a concentration changed up to 8 times over the entire water column and 5.1 times across the sampler. The high resolution of the sampler revealed steep gradients of bacterial abundance and chlorophylls. Bacterial abundance changed up to 35 times m"1, while the water column change was up to 2.1 times m\_1. Chlorophyll a changed up to 45 times m-1, while the water column changes were less than 2 times m-1. These changes and gradients over small scales indicate that at least under some conditions there are 'small'-scale processes occurring that may be important to plankton ecology, as has been suggested by some theoretical studies.},

  abstract = {Aim To assess whether vegetation composition and soil chemistry explain the same or different parts of the variation in the soil microbial community (SMC). Method The above and below-ground communities and soil chemical properties were studied along a successional gradient from moorland to deciduous woodland. The SMC was assessed using PLFAs and M-TRFLPs. Using variance partitioning, Co-Correspondence Analysis (CoCA) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), the variation (total inertia) in the SMC was partitioned into variation which was uniquely explained by either plant composition or soil chemistry, variation explained by both soil chemistry and plant composition, and unexplained variation. Results Plant community composition uniquely explained 30, 13, 16 and 20\% of the inertia and soil chemistry uniquely explained 5, 18, 9 and 9\% of the inertia in the archaeal TRFLPs, bacterial TRFLPs, fungal TRFLPs and all PLFAs, respectively. Conclusion For the first time, variance partitioning was used to include data from a CoCA; although the current limits of such an approach are shown, this study illustrates the potential of such analyses and shows that soil chemistry and plant composition are, in substantial amounts, explaining different parts of the variation within the SMC. This marks an important step in furthering our understanding of the relative importance of different drivers of change in the SMC.},

Here we assess if vegetation composition or soil chemistry best predicts the soil microbial community. The above and below-ground communities and soil chemical properties along a successional gradient from dwarf shrubland (moorland) to deciduous woodland (Betula dominated) were studied. The vegetation and soil chemistry were recorded and the soil microbial community (SMC) assessed using Phospholipid Fatty Acid Extraction (PLFA) and Multiplex Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (M-TRFLP). Vegetation composition and soil chemistry were used to predict the SMC using Co-Correspondence analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis and the predictive power of the two analyses compared. The vegetation composition predicted the soil microbial community at least as well as the soil chemical data. Removing rare plant species from the data set did not improve the predictive power of the vegetation data. The predictive power of the soil chemistry improved when only selected soil variables were used, but which soil variables gave the best prediction varied between the different soil microbial communities being studied (PLFA or bacterial/fungal/archaeal TRFLP). Vegetation composition may represent a more stable ‘summary’ of the effects of multiple drivers over time and may thus be a better predictor of the soil microbial community than one-off measurements of soil properties.},

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the metabolic pathways involved in bacterial cold-adaptation mechanisms are still not fully understood. Herein, we assessed the metabolic features of the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 (PhTAC125), a model organism for cold-adaptation, at both 4\,°C and 15\,°C, by integrating genomic and phenomic (high-throughput phenotyping) data and comparing the obtained results to the taxonomically related Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. TB41 (PspTB41). Although the genome size of PspTB41 is considerably larger than PhTAC125, the higher number of genes did not reflect any higher metabolic versatility at 4\,°C as compared to PhTAC125. Remarkably, protein S-thiolation regulated by glutathione and glutathionylspermidine appeared to be a new possible mechanism for cold adaptation in PhTAC125. More in general, this study represents an example of how ‘multi-omic’ information might potentially contribute in filling the gap between genotypic and phenotypic features related to cold-adaptation mechanisms in bacteria.},

  abstract = {Several Vibrio spp. cause acute and severe mortality events in hatcheries where larvae of bivalve mollusks are reared, potentially leading to subsequent shortage of bivalve seed for the grow-out industry. In particular, strains of Vibrio coralliilyticus have been identified as a major cause of disease in Pacific, Crassostrea gigas, and eastern, C. virginica, oyster hatcheries in the USA of America. Probiotic bacteria are an inexpensive, practical, and natural method of disease control. Previous research shows that pretreatment of larval oysters with probiotic bacteria Bacillus pumilus RI06\&ndash;95 (RI) and Phaeobacter inhibens S4 (S4) significantly decreases mortality caused by experimental challenge with the bacterial pathogen V. coralliilyticus RE22 (RE22). This study aims to characterize the immune response of 6\&ndash;10-day-old eastern oyster larvae to experimental challenge with pathogen V. coralliilyticus RE22 and probionts RI and S4. Treatments included (a) pathogen and probiont exposure at a concentration of 5 \&times; 104 CFU per mL (\textasciitilde 2500 bacterial cells per larva) for a duration of 6 h, (b) probiont exposure at the same concentration for a duration of 24 h, and (c) probiont RI daily treatment of larvae in the hatchery for 4, 11, and 15 days. Differential gene expression analysis compared pathogen or probiotic-treated transcriptomes to unexposed controls. Probiotic and pathogen treatment led to upregulation of transcripts coding for several immune pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in environmental sensing and detection of microbes in oyster larvae. Larval oyster responses to pathogen RE22 suggested suppression of expression of genes in immune signaling pathways (myd88, tak1, nkap), failure in upregulation of immune effector genes, high metabolic demand, and oxidative stress that potentially contributed to mortality. On the other hand, the transcriptomic response to probiotic bacteria RI and S4 suggested activation of immune signaling pathways and expression of immune effectors (e.g., Cv-spi2, mucins and perforin-2). These key features of the host immune response to probiotic bacteria were shared despite the length of probiotic exposure, probiotic species, and the type of environment in which exposures were conducted. This study suggests that pre-exposure of eastern oyster larvae to probiotics for 6\&ndash;24 h prior to pathogenic challenge leads to a robust and effective immune response that may contribute to protecting larvae from subsequent challenge with V. coralliilyticus RE22. This research provides new insights into host-microbe interactions in larval oysters that could be applied in the management of vibriosis in bivalve hatcheries.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, cyanobacterial activity in oceanic photic layers was considered responsible for the marine pelagic dinitrogen (N2) fixation. Other potentially N2-fixing bacteria and archaea have also been detected in the pelagic water column, however, the activity and importance of these non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs (NCDs) remain poorly constrained. In this perspective we summarize the N2 fixation rates from recently published studies on photic and aphotic layers that have been attributed to NCD activity via parallel molecular measurements, and discuss the status, challenges, and data gaps in estimating noncyanobacterial N2 fixation NCNF in the ocean. Rates attributed to NCNF have generally been near the detection limit thus far ({$<$}1 nmol N L−1 d−1). Yet, if considering the large volume of the dark ocean, even low rates of NCNF could make a significant contribution to the new nitrogen input to the ocean. The synthesis here shows that nifH transcription data for NCDs have been reported in only a few studies where N2 fixation rates were detected in the absence of diazotrophic cyanobacteria. In addition, high apparent diversity and regional variability in the NCDs complicate investigations of these communities. Future studies should focus on further investigating impacts of environmental drivers including oxygen, dissolved organic matter, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen on NCNF. Describing the ecology of NCDs and accurately measuring NCNF rates, are critical for a future evaluation of the contribution of NCNF to the marine nitrogen budget.},

Here, we use a comparative in situ metatranscriptomics approach to reveal the functional genomic composition of metabolically active neustonic mesozooplankton community in response to the summer conditions in the Red Sea. The neustonic population exhibited changes in composition and abundance with a significant decline in copepods and appendicularia in July, when Trichodesmium cells were more abundant along with high temperatures and UV-B radiation. Nearly 23,000 genes were differentially expressed at the community level when the metatranscriptomes of the neustonic zooplankton were compared in April, July, and October. On a wider Phylum level, the genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, carbon, nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids were significantly overrepresented in both arthropods and chordates in April and October. On organism level for copepods, expression of genes responsive to oxidative stress, defense against bacteria, immune response, and virus reproduction were increased along with the observed increased appearance of copepod carcasses in the samples collected during July. The differences in expression correspond either to secondary effects of the Trichodesmium bloom or more likely to the increased UV-B radiation in July. Given the dearth of information on the zooplankton gene expression in response to environmental stimuli, our study provides the first transcriptome landscape of the mesozooplankton community during a period of increased mortality of the copepod and appendicularia population.},

In theory, flipping the classroom appears sound: passive learning activities such as unidirectional lectures are pushed to outside class hours in the form of videos, and precious class time is spent on active learning activities. Yet the courses for information systems (IS) undergraduates at the university that the author is teaching at are still conducted in the traditional lecture-in-class, homework-after-class style. In order to increase students’ engagement with the course content and to improve their experience with the course, the author implemented a trial of the flipped classroom model for a programming course with pair programming as the predominant in-class active learning activity. Student feedback on this pedagogy was generally very positive with many respondents considering it effective and helpful for learning. One of the biggest advantages mentioned by students is that they had the option to watch each video lecture as many times as required to be prepared for class. The author also observed that students were more engaged and empowered to take on more ownership for their learning. He recommends that other instructors consider rolling out their own trials of the flipped classroom incrementally for courses that would benefit the most from this pedagogy.},

Ongoing infections of A. anophagefferens by a known Mimiviridae (AaV) occur during bloom peak and decline. Bloom decline is also accompanied by increased activity of viruses other than AaV, including (+) ssRNA viruses. In Narragansett Bay, increased temporal resolution reveals active NCLDVs with both ‘boom-and-bust’ and ‘steady-state infection’-like ecologies that include known as well as novel virus–host interactions. Our approach offers a method for screening active viral infections and develops links between viruses and their potential hosts in situ. Our observations further demonstrate that previously unknown virus–host relationships in marine systems are abundant.},

  abstract = {Historical observations of potential temperature (θ), salinity (S), and dissolved oxygen concentrations (O2) in the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic (0–500 m; 0–40°N, 10–90°W) were examined to understand decadal-scale changes in O2 in subtropical underwater (STUW). STUW is observed at four of the longest, sustained ocean biogeochemical and ecological time series stations, namely, the CArbon Retention In A Colored Ocean (CARIACO) Ocean Time Series Program (10.5°N, 64.7°W), the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS; 31.7°N, 64.2°W), Hydrostation “S” (32.1°N, 64.4°W), and the European Station for Time-series in the Ocean, Canary Islands (ESTOC; 29.2°N, 15.5°W). Observations over similar time periods at CARIACO (1996–2013), BATS (1988–2011), and Hydrostation S (1980–2013) show that STUW O2 has decreased approximately 0.71, 0.28, and 0.37 μmol kgÀ1 yrÀ1, respectively. No apparent change in STUW O2 was observed at ESTOC over the course of the time series (1994–2013). Ship observation data for the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic archived at NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center show that between 1980 and 2013, STUW O2 (upper \textasciitilde 300 m) declined 0.58 μmol kgÀ1 yrÀ1 in the southeastern Caribbean Sea (10–15°N, 60–70°W) and 0.68 μmol kgÀ1 yrÀ1 in the western subtropical North Atlantic (30–35°N, 60–65°W). A declining O2 trend was not observed in the eastern subtropical North Atlantic (25–30°N, 15–20°W) over the same period. Most of the observed O2 loss seems to result from shifts in ventilation associated with decreased wind-driven mixing and a slowing down of STUW formation rates, rather than changes in diffusive air-sea O2 gas exchange or changes in the biological oceanography of the North Atlantic. Variability of STUW O2 showed a significant relationship with the wintertime (January–March) Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index (AMO, R2 = 0.32). During negative wintertime AMO years trade winds are typically stronger between 10°N and 30°N. These conditions stimulate the formation and ventilation of STUW. The decreasing trend in STUW O2 in the three decades spanning 1980 through 2013 reflects the shift from a strongly negative wintertime AMO between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s to a positive wintertime AMO observed between the mid-1990s and 2013. These changes in STUW O2 were captured by the CARIACO, BATS, and Hydrostation S time series stations. Sustained positive AMO conditions could lead to further deoxygenation in tropical and subtropical North Atlantic upper waters.},

Those interactions are varied: they can be antagonistic ones involving predation, herbivory and parasitism, or mutualistic ones, such as those involving the pollination of flowers by insects. Moreover, the metaphor hints that the interactions may be complex to the point of being impossible to understand. All interactions can be visualized as ecological networks, in which species are linked together, either directly or indirectly through intermediate species. Ecological networks, although complex, have well defined patterns that both illuminate the ecological mechanisms underlying them and promise a better understanding of the relationship between complexity and ecological stability.},

Physiologically and genetically distinct Prochlorococcus ecotypes partition the water column: high-B/A (low-light adapted) ecotypes are generally restricted to the deep euphotic zone near or at the nitracline. Low-B/A (high-light adapted) ecotypes predominate in, but are not limited to, NO3–depleted surface waters, where they outnumber coexisting Synechococcus populations. The niche partitioning by different Prochlorococcus ecotypes begs the question of whether they also differ in their nitrogen (N) utilization physiology, especially with respect to NO3- utilization. To explore this possibility, we studied the capabilities of different Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus strains to grow on a variety of N sources. We found that all the isolates grew well on NH4+ and all were capable of urea utilization, occasionally at a lower growth rate. None of the Prochlorococcus isolates were able to grow with NO3-. Four high-B/A Prochlorococcus isolates grew on NO2-, but all others did not. Whole genome analysis of the low-B/A Prochlorococcus MED4 revealed that the genes required for NO3- uptake and reduction were absent. The genome of the high-B/A Prochlorococcus MIT 9313 also lacked the NO3- utilization genes but has homologs of genes required for NO2- utilization consistent with its physiology and ecology. Thus, the utilization of different N sources in the marine environment is partitioned among closely related ecotypes, each with adaptations optimized for the environment where these sources are available.},

A vast number of compounds are present in DOM, and they play important roles in all major element cycles, contribute to the storage of atmospheric CO2 in the ocean, support marine ecosystems, and facilitate interactions between organisms. At the heart of the DOM cycle lie molecular-level relationships between the individual compounds in DOM and the members of the ocean microbiome that produce and consume them. In the past, these connections have eluded clear definition because of the sheer numerical complexity of both DOM molecules and microorganisms. Emerging tools in analytical chemistry, microbiology, and informatics are breaking down the barriers to a fuller appreciation of these connections. Here we highlight questions being addressed using recent methodological and technological developments in those fields and consider how these advances are transforming our understanding of some of the most important reactions of the marine carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Spectral reflectances of the ocean, R, as derived from ocean color remote sensing data at four wavelengths (412, 443, 490, and 555~nm), can be used to form two ratios of spectral reflectance, namely R(412)/R(443), and R(490)/R(555), thereafter denoted R443412 and R555490. The former is mainly sensitive to the colored dissolved organic material (CDOM), albeit influenced by the algal content as depicted by the chlorophyll concentration, ([Chl]); in contrast, the latter is essentially depending on [Chl], although it is also influenced by CDOM. Therefore the signatures of CDOM and [Chl] which are not truly separable, can nevertheless be identified by considering simultaneously the two ratios. The concomitant variations in these ratios can be established via a bio-optical model developed for Case 1 waters. This model implicitly includes a “mean” relationship between CDOM and [Chl], and thus produces a unique curve relating R443412 to R555490. Deviations with respect to this mean relationship can be introduced through a factor Φ, with Φ \&gt; 1 (excess) or \&lt; 1 (deficit), applied to the CDOM–[Chl] ratio. A family of R443412–R555490 curves is thus generated, in correspondence with the discrete values given to Φ; this “grid” (or numerically, a 2-D lookup table) allows the Φ–[Chl] couple to be unambiguously derived for any R443412–R555490 couple. By applying this straightforward algorithm to actual reflectance ratios derived from ocean color imagery, the relative anomalies in CDOM with respect to its standard (Chl-related) values can be efficiently assessed. Within the global ocean (discarding the coastal zones), the Φ factor is widely varying, between at least ⅓ and 3, and is roughly log-normally distributed around \textasciitilde{} 1 (no anomaly). The spatial distributions of the Φ factor in the whole ocean are strongly featured according to latitude, season, and hydrographic regimes, and these features are regularly reproducible, from year to year (2002–2007). This simple method is also validated against available in situ data, and its results compare favorably, for instance, to those of the GSM (Garver–Siegel–Maritorena) inversion method, in terms of retrieved CDOM concentrations and distribution patterns.},

  abstract = {In this study we exploit recent advances in high-resolution autonomous monitoring to investigate the impact of short-term variations in wind-induced mixing on the surface biomass and vertical distribution of buoyant and sinking phytoplankton species. An autonomous platform (the Automatic Water Quality Monitoring Station) moored in a Mediterranean reservoir provided minute-by-minute records of wind speed and the phytoplankton fluorescence during winter and summer. This information was then used here to quantify the impact of short-term changes in the weather on the vertical distribution of diatoms and cyanobacteria. Additionally, we apply an empirical model to determine the extent of entrainment of diatoms and cyanobacteria within the turbulent upper layers of the water column. During winter, the surface time series of fluorescence was positively correlated with the short-term variations in wind speed. In contrast, during the summer, fluorescence was negatively correlated with wind speed. In the latter case, turbulence overcame the flotation velocity of buoyant cyanobacteria, thus homogenizing their vertical distribution and decreasing surface biomass. In both cases, the dynamic response of surface phytoplankton biomass to short-term changes in wind stress was rapid, within the minute scale. As far as we know from the literature, this is the first study in which the interaction between wind stress and surface phytoplankton fluorescence has been quantified on such a fine temporal scale. Finally, relevance for forecasting and reservoir management is pointed out.},

Although this relationship is central to biodiversity and biogeography, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a general framework to describe how the distance–decay relationship is influenced by population aggregation and the landscape-scale species-abundance distribution. We utilize this general framework and data from three tropical forests to show that rare species have a weak influence on distance–decay curves, and that overall similarity and rates of decay are primarily influenced by species abundances and population aggregation respectively. We illustrate the utility of the framework by deriving an exact analytical expression of the distance–decay relationship when population aggregation is characterized by the Poisson Cluster Process. Our study provides a foundation for understanding the distance–decay relationship, and for predicting and testing patterns of beta-diversity under competing theories in ecology., Ecology Letters (2008) 11: 904–917},

We separated microbial cells from various types of marine sediment and then recovered the cells using multilayer density gradients of sodium polytungstate and/or Nycodenz, resulting in a notably higher percent recovery of cells than previous methods. The efficiency of cell extraction generally depends on the sediment depth; using the new technique we developed, more than 80\% of the total cells were recovered from shallow sediment samples (down to 100 meters in depth), whereas \textasciitilde 50\% of cells were recovered from deep samples (100-365 m in depth). The separated cells could be rapidly enumerated using flow cytometry (FCM). The data were in good agreement with those obtained from manual microscopic direct counts over the range 10(4)-10(8) cells cm(-3). We also demonstrated that sedimentary microbial cells can be efficiently collected using a cell sorter. The combined use of our new cell separation and FCM/cell sorting techniques facilitates high-throughput and precise enumeration of microbial cells in sediments and is amenable to various types of single-cell analyses, thereby enhancing our understanding of microbial life in the largely uncharacterized deep subseafloor biosphere.},

  abstract = {Bacterioplankton are major biogeochemical agents responsible for mediating the flux of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and subsequent cycling of nutrients in the oceans. Most information about the composition of bacterioplankton communities has come from studies along well-defined biogeochemical gradients in the northern hemisphere. This study extends observations of spatial and temporal dynamics for SAR11, Actinobacteria and OCS116 in the North Atlantic by demonstrating distinct spatial variability in the abundance and distribution of these and other lineages across the South Atlantic gyre and in the Benguela upwelling system. We identified shifts in SAR11, Actinobacteria, OCS116, SAR86, SAR116 and members of the Roseobacter clade along basin-scale gradients in nutrients, chlorophyll and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Distinct SAR11 subclades dominated the western and eastern regions of the gyre, and Actinobacteria, OCS116 and members of the Roseobacter lineages were most abundant at the deep chlorophyll maxima. SAR86 and SAR116 accounted for a significant fraction of coastal and open ocean communities, respectively, and members of the gamma sulfur oxidizer (GSO) clade persisted in the Benguela upwelling system. These data suggest that distinct communities are partitioned along basin-scale biogeochemical gradients, that SAR11 community structure varies across the gyre and that Actinobacteria, OCS116, and members of the Roseobacter clade are closely associated with phytoplankton in the gyre.},

Recent advances in analytical and visualization techniques leverage these data and are propelling mineralogy from a largely descriptive field into one of prediction within complex, integrated, multidimensional systems. These discoveries include: (1) systematic changes in the character of carbon minerals and their networks of coexisting species through deep time; (2) improved statistical predictions of the number and types of carbon minerals that occur on Earth but are yet to be discovered and described; and (3) a range of proposed and ongoing studies related to the quantification of network structures and trends, relation of mineral “natural kinds” to their genetic environments, prediction of the location of mineral species across the globe, examination of the tectonic drivers of mineralization through deep time, quantification of preservational and sampling bias in the mineralogical record, and characterization of feedback relationships between minerals and geochemical environments with microbial populations. These aspects of Earth’s carbon mineralogy underscore the complex coevolution of the geosphere and biosphere and highlight the possibility for scientific discovery in Earth and planetary systems.},

  abstract = {Increased water demands have led to a notable interest in the use of treated wastewater for reuse. Typically, this results from the implementation of advanced treatment of final effluent from wastewater treatment plants prior to reuse for potable or non-potable purposes. Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is a natural treatment process in which water from sources of varying quality is infiltrated into the soil to further improve its quality. The goal of this study was to determine the log10 reduction values (LRVs) of viruses naturally present in treated effluent and evaluate two potential indicators of virus removal and transport, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and crAssphage, during SAT of treated effluent. Groundwater was sampled at three wells with different attributes within the Sweetwater Recharge Facility (SWRF) in Tucson, AZ. These sites vary greatly in operational parameters such as effluent infiltration rates and wetting/drying cycles, which may influence virus removal efficiency. Detection of adenovirus, enterovirus, PMMoV, and crAssphage were determined by qPCR/RT-qPCR and log10 reduction values (LRVs) were determined. PMMoV and crAssphage were detected in groundwater associated with a set of recharge basins that exhibited shorter wetting/drying cycles and faster infiltration rates. LRVs for crAssphage and PMMoV at this site ranged from 3.9 to 5.8, respectively. Moreover, PMMoV was detected downflow of the SAT sites, indicating the potential degradation of microbial groundwater quality in the region surrounding managed aquifer recharge facilities. Overall, PMMoV and crAssphage showed potential as conservative process indicators of virus removal during SAT, particularly for attribution of LRV credits. Moreover, the detection of these viruses indicated the potential influence of wetting/drying cycles on virus removal by SAT, a parameter that has not yet been studied with respect to biological contaminants.},

Other than indications of their prevalence in seawater, little is known about these organisms. Here we report quantitative measurements of the cellular abundance of the SAR11 clade in northwestern Sargasso Sea waters to 3,000 m and in Oregon coastal surface waters. On average, the SAR11 clade accounts for a third of the cells present in surface waters and nearly a fifth of the cells present in the mesopelagic zone. In some regions, members of the SAR11 clade represent as much as 50\% of the total surface microbial community and 25\% of the subeuphotic microbial community. By extrapolation, we estimate that globally there are 2.4 1028 SAR11 cells in the oceans, half of which are located in the euphotic zone. Although the biogeochemical role of the SAR11 clade remains uncertain, these data support the conclusion that this microbial group is among the most successful organisms on Earth.},

Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of monthly surface and 200-m bacterial 16S rDNA T-RFLP fragments from 1992 to 2002 revealed temporal trends in bacterial community structure in different depth horizons. A 200-m 16S IRNA gene clone library was used to identify fragments increasing in relative abundance following mixing events and to link observed terminal restriction fragments with those predicted from sequence data. T-RFLP fragments matching those of cloned OCS116, SAR11, and marine Actinobacteria rRNA genes exhibited the strongest increases at 200 In following convective overturn, and fragments attributable to SAR11, SAR86, and SAR116 rRNA genes exhibited the strongest increases at the ocean surface during summer time periods. Variability in the distribution and relative abundance of fragments assigned to different SAR11 and SAR86 subclusters was also evident. Quantitative hybridization of extracted 16S IRNA with radiolabeled, taxon-specific oligonucleotide probes provided additional data supporting spatial and temporal patterns of lineage distributions and abundances suggested by ordination. Overall increases in the relative abundance of T-RFLP fragments attributable to the OCS116, SAR11, and marine Actinobacteria clusters following convective overturn suggest that members of these groups may play important roles in dissolved organic carbon dynamics at BATS.},

Mineral analysis on frozen renal tissue from 2 out of 2 cases revealed mildly elevated Ca:P ratio in both. Clinically significant observations were preservation of the integrity of basement membranes after grape-induced tubular injury and presence of early epithelial regeneration. Thus, recovery may be possible if anuria is aggressively managed.

  abstract = {Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled novel insights into microbial niche differentiation, from analyzing environmental samples to understanding human diseases and informing dietary studies. However, identifying the microbial taxa that differentiate these samples can be challenging. These issues stem from the compositional nature of 16S rRNA gene data (or, more generally, taxon or functional gene data); the changes in the relative abundance of one taxon influence the apparent abundances of the others. Here we acknowledge that inferring properties of individual bacteria is a difficult problem and instead introduce the concept of balances to infer meaningful properties of subcommunities, rather than properties of individual species. We show that balances can yield insights about niche differentiation across multiple microbial environments, including soil environments and lung sputum. These techniques have the potential to reshape how we carry out future ecological analyses aimed at revealing differences in relative taxonomic abundances across different samples. IMPORTANCE By explicitly accounting for the compositional nature of 16S rRNA gene data through the concept of balances, balance trees yield novel biological insights into niche differentiation.

These properties make the filters potentially useful for harvesting total microbial communities from water samples for molecular analyses, but their performance for nucleic acid extraction has not been systematically or quantitatively evaluated. In this study, we characterized the flux of water through commercially produced nanoporous (0.02 μm) AAO filters (Anotop; Whatman) and used isolates (a virus, a bacterium, and a protist) and natural seawater samples to test variables that we expected would influence the efficiency with which nucleic acids are recovered from the filters. Extraction chemistry had a significant effect on DNA yield, and back flushing the filters during extraction was found to improve yields of high-molecular-weight DNA. Using the back-flush protocol, the mass of DNA recovered from microorganisms collected on AAO filters was ≥100\% of that extracted from pellets of cells and viruses and 94\% ± 9\% of that obtained by direct extraction of a liquid bacterial culture. The latter is a minimum estimate of the relative recovery of microbial DNA, since liquid cultures include dissolved nucleic acids that are retained inefficiently by the filter. In conclusion, we demonstrate that nucleic acids can be extracted from microorganisms on AAO filters with an efficiency similar to that achievable by direct extraction of microbes in suspension or in pellets. These filters are therefore a convenient means by which to harvest total microbial communities from multiple aqueous samples in parallel for subsequent molecular analyses.},

  abstract = {Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) is the proportion of assimilated carbon that is converted into biomass and reflects the balance between growth and energetic demands. Often measured as an aggregate property of the community, BGE is highly variable within and across ecosystems. To understand this variation, we first identified how species identity and resource type affect BGE using 20 bacterial isolates belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria that were enriched from north temperate lakes. Using a trait-based approach that incorporated genomic and phenotypic information, we characterized the metabolism of each isolate and tested for predicted trade-offs between growth rate and efficiency. A substantial amount of variation in BGE could be explained at broad (i.e., order, 20\%) and fine (i.e., strain, 58\%) taxonomic levels. While resource type was a relatively weak predictor across species, it explained {$>$}60\% of the variation in BGE within a given species. A metabolic trade-off (between maximum growth rate and efficiency) and genomic features revealed that BGE may be a species-specific metabolic property. Our study suggests that genomic and phylogenetic information may help predict aggregate microbial community functions like BGE and the fate of carbon in ecosystems.},

First, using unique representative probability samples of the American public, tracking the same individuals from 2012 to 2016, I examine the “left behind” thesis (that is, the theory that those who lost jobs or experienced stagnant wages due to the loss of manufacturing jobs punished the incumbent party for their economic misfortunes). Second, I consider the possibility that status threat felt by the dwindling proportion of traditionally high-status Americans (i.e., whites, Christians, and men) as well as by those who perceive America’s global dominance as threatened combined to increase support for the candidate who emphasized reestablishing status hierarchies of the past. Results do not support an interpretation of the election based on pocketbook economic concerns. Instead, the shorter relative distance of people’s own views from the Republican candidate on trade and China corresponded to greater mass support for Trump in 2016 relative to Mitt Romney in 2012. Candidate preferences in 2016 reflected increasing anxiety among high-status groups rather than complaints about past treatment among low-status groups. Both growing domestic racial diversity and globalization contributed to a sense that white Americans are under siege by these engines of change.},

  abstract = {Biogeography may be defined simply as the study of the geographical distribution of organisms, but this simple defmition hides the great complexity of the subject. Biogeography transcends classical subject areas and involves a range of scientific disciplines that includes geogra phy, geology and biology. Not surprisingly, therefore, it means rather different things to different people. Historically, the study of biogeogra phy has been concentrated into compartments at separate points along a spatio-temporal gradient. At one end of the gradient, ecological biogeography is concerned with ecological processes occurring over short temporal and small spatial scales, whilst at the other end, historical biogeography is concerned with evolutionary processes over millions of years on a large, often global scale. Between these end points lies a third major compartment concerned with the profound effects of Pleistocene glaciations and how these have affected the distribution of recent organisms. Within each of these compartments along the scale gradient, a large number of theories, hypotheses and models have been proposed in an attempt to explain the present and past biotic distribution patterns. To a large extent, these compartments of the subject have been non-interactive, which is understandable from the different interests and backgrounds of the various researchers. Nevertheless, the distribu tions of organisms across the globe cannot be fully understood without a knowledge of the full spectrum of ecological and historical processes. There are no degrees in biogeography and today' s biogeographers are primarily born out of some other discipline.},

If this is the case, then communities with larger numbers of species should be more predictable with respect to properties such as local biomass. That is, larger numbers of species should enhance ecosystem reliability, where reliability refers to the probability that a system will provide a consistent level of performance over a given unit of time. The validity of this hypothesis has important ecological, management and economic implications given the large-scale substitution of diverse natural ecosystems with less diverse managed systems. No experimental evidence, however, has supported this hypothesis. To test this hypothesis we established replicated microbial microcosms with varying numbers of species per functional group. We found that as the number of species per functional group increased, replicate communities were more consistent in biomass and density measures. These results suggest that redundancy (in the sense of having multiple species per functional group) is a valuable commodity, and that the provision of adequate redundancy may be one reason for preserving biodiversity.},

  abstract = {The ecosystem consequences of dramatic declines or changes in biodiversity have spurred considerable research and tremendous debate that has rekindled most of the major conflicts in ecology, creating a sense of déjà vu. These conflicts include whether ecosystem or community ecology provides better insights into the workings of nature, the relative importance of biotic vs. abiotic factors in governing community composition and structure, the virtues of phenomenological vs. mechanistic research, the relationship between biodiversity and stability, the relative importance of taxonomic vs. functional diversity, and the relative strengths of observation vs. experimental approaches. Although the tone of the debate has been regrettable, its magnitude signifies the emergence of a new paradigm, one in a series of debates associated with the dialectic that has structured ecological inquiry over two millennia of Western science. This dialectic concerns the tension between those who seek to explain nature by studying its parts and those who seek to explain nature by studying whole-system behavior. Philosophers and historians argue that such a dialectic generates cycles in which a central tenet is challenged by an emerging paradigm, generating new theories and new data to test the emerging paradigm. The scientific community evaluates the accumulating evidence (and it is here that the debates arise), and if subscription to the emerging paradigm increases sufficiently, the emerging paradigm evolves into a new central tenet. Fractionation within the sciences exacerbates this cycle because subdisciplines often focus on either the parts or the whole. Such splintering can be traced to the abandonment of the holistic approach of Aristotelian science during the Scientific Revolution. While such holism may have lessened debate, some have argued that it stagnated Western science. The dialectic, the cycles of emerging paradigms it generates, and the debates that surround each emergence represent the vehicle by which ecology moves forward. Emerging paradigms force scientists to revisit central tenets, pitting old ideas against new theories and new data, and this revisiting is what generates the sense of déjà vu and the cycles of vigorous debate, but ultimately each cycle leads to synthesis and progress. The emerging paradigm that biodiversity governs ecosystem function is rapidly evolving. In the words of Thomas Kuhn, its controversial experiments have successfully articulated the paradigm. It has successfully challenged ecology's central tenet that biodiversity is primarily an epiphenomenon of ecosystem function secondarily structured by community processes. In its most extreme form, it claims that the reverse is true. Of course, neither the central tenet of ecology nor the emerging paradigm is correct in an absolute sense, but the dialectic that promoted the emergence of biodiversity and ecosystem function as a paradigm redirected ecology to focus on the feedback between ecosystem function and biodiversity rather than studying them independently. The final stage in the evolution of this emerging paradigm will be explicit tests of synthetic mechanisms that have been proposed. Familiarity with the ecological dialectic provides a framework by which ecologists can understand the origin and utility of paradigms in ecology, provides a proper context for the debate that surrounds paradigms as they emerge, promotes synthesis, and deters intellectual chauvinism that may inadvertently accompany specialization within ecology.},

  abstract = {A phosphorus-based model of nutrient cycling has been developed and used in conjunction with a general circulation model to evaluate the roles of the dissolved and sinking particulate phases in the downward transport of organic matter in the ocean. If sinking particles dominate the downward transport and remineralize in accord with observations made primarily with sediment traps, we find in equatorial upwelling regions that particle fluxes and thermocline nutrient concentrations are higher than observed. These enhanced fluxes and concentrations are a result of what we term “nutrient trapping,” a positive feedback whereby high upwelling produces high new production that results in remineralization and enhanced nutrient concentrations in the upwelling water, which further increases new production. Nutrient trapping in shallow upwelling zones can be eliminated by increasing the particle flux length scale, which suggests that if sinking particles dominate the downward transport of organic matter then the flux length scale is longer than observed. Even with a longer particle flux length scale, we find that nutrients are trapped in some deep convective regions of the southern ocean, where new production is predicted to be much higher than the observed primary production. In simulations where the downward transport of organic matter takes place primarily in a dissolved phase, nutrient trapping is completely eliminated, in both upwelling and convective regions. The models with dissolved organic matter also agree fairly well with nutrient transports in the north Atlantic Ocean calculated from observed nutrient and hydrographic data (Rintoul and Wunsch, 1991). Our results therefore support the dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon measurements made with the high-temperature combustion technique of Suzuki et al. (1985) and Sugimura and Suzuki (1988) and suggest that there exists an as-yet undiscovered pool of dissolved organic phosphorus in the ocean. We also use the various models to make an estimate of global new production of 2.9 to 3.6 mol C/m2/yr (12 to 15 Gt C/yr).},

  abstract = {We review current understanding of the potential impact of climate change on the Chesapeake Bay. Scenarios for CO2 emissions indicate that by the end of the 21st century the Bay region will experience significant changes in climate forcings with respect to historical conditions, including increases in CO2 concentrations, sea level, and water temperature of 50–160\%, 0.7–1.6m, and 2–6°C, respectively. Also likely are increases in precipitation amount (very likely in the winter and spring), precipitation intensity, intensity of tropical and extratropical cyclones (though their frequency may decrease), and sea-level variability. The greatest uncertainty is associated with changes in annual streamflow, though it is likely that winter and spring flows will increase. Climate change alone will cause the Bay to function very differently in the future. Likely changes include: (1) an increase in coastal flooding and submergence of estuarine wetlands; (2) an increase in salinity variability on many time scales; (3) an increase in harmful algae; (4) an increase in hypoxia; (5) a reduction of eelgrass, the dominant submerged aquatic vegetation in the Bay; and (6) altered interactions among trophic levels, with subtropical fish and shellfish species ultimately being favored in the Bay. The magnitude of these changes is sensitive to the CO2 emission trajectory, so that actions taken now to reduce CO2 emissions will reduce climate impacts on the Bay. Research needs include improved precipitation and streamflow projections for the Bay watershed and whole-system monitoring, modeling, and process studies that can capture the likely non-linear responses of the Chesapeake Bay system to climate variability, climate change, and their interaction with other anthropogenic stressors.},

  abstract = {Background: Shotgun metagenomic sequencing reveals the potential in microbial communities. However, lowercost 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing provides taxonomic, not functional, observations. To remedy this, we previously introduced Piphillin, a software package that predicts functional metagenomic content based on the frequency of detected 16S rRNA gene sequences corresponding to genomes in regularly updated, functionally annotated genome databases. Piphillin (and similar tools) have previously been evaluated on 16S rRNA data processed by the clustering of sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). New techniques such as amplicon sequence variant error correction are in increased use, but it is unknown if these techniques perform better in metagenomic content prediction pipelines, or if they should be treated the same as OTU data in respect to optimal pipeline parameters. Results: To evaluate the effect of 16S rRNA sequence analysis method (clustering sequences into OTUs vs amplicon sequence variant error correction into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)) on the ability of Piphillin to predict functional metagenomic content, we evaluated Piphillin-predicted functional content from 16S rRNA sequence data processed through OTU clustering and error correction into ASVs compared to corresponding shotgun metagenomic data. We show a strong correlation between metagenomic data and Piphillin-predicted functional content resulting from both 16S rRNA sequence analysis methods. Differential abundance testing with Piphillinpredicted functional content exhibited a low false positive rate ({$<$} 0.05) while capturing a large fraction of the differentially abundant features resulting from corresponding metagenomic data. However, Piphillin prediction performance was optimal at different cutoff parameters depending on 16S rRNA sequence analysis method. Using data analyzed with amplicon sequence variant error correction, Piphillin outperformed comparable tools, for instance exhibiting 19\% greater balanced accuracy and 54\% greater precision compared to PICRUSt2. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that raw Illumina sequences should be processed for subsequent Piphillin analysis using amplicon sequence variant error correction (with DADA2 or similar methods) and run using a 99\% ID cutoff for Piphillin, while sequences generated on platforms other than Illumina should be processed via OTU clustering (e.g., UPARSE) and run using a 96\% ID cutoff for Piphillin. Piphillin is publicly available for academic users (Piphillin server. http://piphillin.secondgenome.com/.)},

  abstract = {Recent spacecraft and robotic probes to Mars have yielded data that are changing our understanding significantly about the possibility of existing or past life on that planet. Coupled with advances in biology and life-detection techniques, these developments place increasing importance on the need to protect Mars from contamination by Earth-borne organisms. To help with this effort, NASA requested that the NRC examine existing planetary protection measures for Mars and recommend changes and further research to improve such measures. This report discusses policies, requirements, and techniques to protect Mars from organisms originating on Earth that could interfere with scientific investigations. It provides recommendations on cleanliness and biological burden levels of Mars-bound spacecraft, methods to reach those levels, and research to reduce uncertainties in preventing forward contamination of Mars.},

  abstract = {The biological processes involved during mixing of a river plume with the marine underlying water were studied off the Rhone River outlet. Samples of suspended and dissolved matter were collected while tracking a drifting buoy. Three trajectories were performed, at 2-day intervals, under different hydrological and meteorological situations. A biological uptake was evidenced from ammonium (NH4) and phosphate (PO4) shortage, indicating an early “NH4-dependent” functioning occurring before the well-known “NO3-based” cycle. The different ratios between NH4, NO3 and PO4, as a function of salinity, were discussed to detail the preferential use in PO3 and NH4. Salinity zones with enhanced bacterial production, high chlorophyll a concentration, as well as DOG, NH4 and PO4 consumption were evidenced from 20 to 35 in salinity. It was shown that the successive abundance of bacteria and phytoplankton during transfer reflected the competition for PO3 of both communities. On the Rhone River plume, the role played by temperature, light conditions and suspended matter upon biological activity seems relatively minor compared to salinity distribution and its related parameter: nutrient availability. It can be concluded that biological uptake in the Rhone River plume was closely related to the dilution mechanism, controlled itself by the dynamics of the plume. In windless conditions and close to the river mouth, the density gradient between marine and river water induced limited exchanges between the nutrient-rich freshwater and the potential consumers in the underlying marine water. Consequently, Little biological activity is observed close to the river mouth. Offshore, mixing is enhanced and a balance is reached between salinity tolerance and nutrient availability to form a favourable zone for marine phytoplankton development. This can be quite far from the river mouth in case of a widely spread plume, corresponding to high river discharge. Under windy and wavy conditions, the plume freshwater is early and rapidly mixed, so that the extension of the “enhanced production zone” is drastically reduced and even bacteria could not benefit from the fast mixing regime induced.

We assessed dynamics in relative abundance and potential activities by sequencing the small sub-unit ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA gene) and rRNA molecules (rRNA) of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota once to twice daily between March 2014 and May 2014 from the surface ocean off Catalina Island, California. Typically Ostreococcus, Braarudosphaera, Teleaulax, and Synechococcus dominated phytoplankton sequences (including chloroplasts) while SAR11, Sulfitobacter, and Fluviicola dominated non-phytoplankton Bacteria and Archaea. We observed short-lived increases of diatoms, mostly Pseudo-nitzschia and Chaetoceros, with quickly responding Bacteria and Archaea including Flavobacteriaceae (Polaribacter \& Formosa), Roseovarius, and Euryarchaeota (MGII), notably the exact amplicon sequence variants we observed responding similarly to another diatom bloom nearby, 3 years prior. We observed correlations representing known interactions among abundant phytoplankton rRNA sequences, demonstrating the biogeochemical and ecological relevance of such interactions: (1) The kleptochloroplastidic ciliate Mesodinium 18S rRNA gene sequences and a single Teleaulax taxon (via 16S rRNA gene sequences) were correlated (Spearman r\,=\,0.83) yet uncorrelated to a Teleaulax 18S rRNA gene OTU, or any other taxon (consistent with a kleptochloroplastidic or karyokleptic relationship) and (2) the photosynthetic prymnesiophyte Braarudosphaera bigelowii and two strains of diazotrophic cyanobacterium UCYN-A were correlated and each taxon was also correlated to other taxa, including B. bigelowii to a verrucomicrobium and a dictyochophyte phytoplankter (all r\,{$>$}\,0.8). We also report strong correlations (r\,{$>$}\,0.7) between various ciliates, bacteria, and phytoplankton, suggesting interactions via currently unknown mechanisms. These data reiterate the utility of high-frequency time series to show rapid microbial reactions to stimuli, and provide new information about in situ dynamics of previously recognized and hypothesized interactions.},

  abstract = {Numerous ecological processes, such as bacteriophage infection and phytoplankton–bacterial interactions, often occur via strain-specific mechanisms. Therefore, studying the causes of microbial dynamics should benefit from highly resolving taxonomic characterizations. We sampled daily to weekly over 5 months following a phytoplankton bloom off Southern California and examined the extent of microdiversity, that is, significant variation within 99\% sequence similarity clusters, operational taxonomic units (OTUs), of bacteria, archaea, phytoplankton chloroplasts (all via 16S or intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences) and T4-like-myoviruses (via g23 major capsid protein gene sequence). The extent of microdiversity varied between genes (ITS most, g23 least) and only temporally common taxa were highly microdiverse. Overall, 60\% of taxa exhibited microdiversity; 59\% of these had subtypes that changed significantly as a proportion of the parent taxon, indicating ecologically distinct taxa. Pairwise correlations between prokaryotes and myoviruses or phytoplankton (for example, highly microdiverse Chrysochromulina sp.) improved when using single-base variants. Correlations between myoviruses and SAR11 increased in number (172 vs 9, Spearman{$>$}0.65) and became stronger (0.61 vs 0.58, t-test: P{$<$}0.001) when using SAR11 ITS single-base variants vs OTUs. Whole-community correlation between SAR11 and myoviruses was much improved when using ITS single-base variants vs OTUs, with Mantel rho=0.49 vs 0.27; these results are consistent with strain-specific interactions. Mantel correlations suggested {$>$}1\,μm (attached/large) prokaryotes are a major myovirus source. Consideration of microdiversity improved observation of apparent host and virus networks, and provided insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors influencing the success of lineages, with important implications to ecosystem resilience and microbial function.},

We collected surface seawater once daily for 38 consecutive days with seven more samples interspersed over 40 more days at one location ∼2\,km from Santa Catalina Island, California. Bacterial communities were analyzed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and viral communities were analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) of the conserved T4-like myoviral gene encoding the major capsid protein (g23). Common bacterial and viral taxa were consistently dominant, and relatively few displayed dramatic increases/decreases or 'boom/bust' patterns that might be expected from dynamic predator-prey interactions. Association network analysis showed most significant covariations (associations) occurred among bacterial taxa or among viral taxa and there were several modular (highly-interconnected) associations (P≤0.005). Associations observed between bacteria and viruses (P≤0.005) occurred with a median time lag of 2 days. Regression of all pairwise Bray-Curtis similarities between samples indicated a rate of bacterial community change that slows from 2.1\%-0.18\% per day over a week to 2 months; the rate stays around 0.4\% per day for viruses. Our interpretation is that, over the scale of days, individual bacterial and viral OTUs can be dynamic and patterned; resulting in statistical associations regarded as potential ecological interactions. However, over the scale of weeks, average bacterial community variation is slower, suggesting that there is strong community-level ecological resilience, that is, a tendency to converge towards a 'mean' microbial community set by longer-term controlling factors.},

  abstract = {Eddies are mesoscale oceanographic features (∼\,200\,km diameter) that can cause transient blooms of phytoplankton by shifting density isoclines in relation to light and nutrient resources. To better understand how bacterioplankton respond to eddies, we examined depth-resolved distributions of bacterial populations across an anticyclonic mode-water eddy in the Sargasso Sea. Previous work on this eddy has documented elevated phytoplankton productivity and diatom abundance within the eddy centre with coincident bacterial productivity and biomass maxima. We illustrate bacterial community shifts within the eddy centre, differentiating populations uplifted along isopycnals from those enriched or depleted at horizons of enhanced bacterial and primary productivity. Phylotypes belonging to the Roseobacter, OCS116 and marine Actinobacteria clades were enriched in the eddy core and were highly correlated with pigment-based indicators of diatom abundance, supporting developing hypotheses that members of these clades associate with phytoplankton blooms. Typical mesopelagic clades (SAR202, SAR324, SAR406 and SAR11 IIb) were uplifted within the eddy centre, increasing bacterial diversity in the lower euphotic zone. Typical surface oligotrophic clades (SAR116, OM75, Prochlorococcus and SAR11 Ia) were relatively depleted in the eddy centre. The biogeochemical context of a bloom-inducing eddy provides insight into the ecology of the diverse uncultured bacterioplankton dominating the oligotrophic oceans.},

The flux of organic carbon at 100 m depth was about 15\% of the mass flux and about 5\% of the rate of primary production measured in the surface waters. At 500 m the flux of organic carbon had decreased to about half that at 100 m. Characteristics of the trap collections indicated a large biogenic contribution. In the second deployment, much of this appeared to be the fecal material of the pelagic red crab, Pleuroncodes. The biomass carbon of microorganisms determined by microscopy (exclusive of heterotrophic bacteria) in the surface waters was dominated by nano- and picoplankton size categories. In the sediment trap collections, total microorganism carbon comprised {$<$}3\% of the carbon flux. A six-month (May–November) sediment trap deployment (500 and 824 m) was also made. The higher mass flux to the deeper of these traps indicates near-bottom transport of resuspended sediments. Near-bottom transport of particles may explain the higher mass fluxes (by a factor of two) reported in two 1977 sediment trap studies in the inner basins, and the higher rate of sediment accumulation previously estimated from analysis of sediments. A transmissometer survey indicated that the concentration of suspended particles in the deep waters of the San Pedro Basin was low during the period of the May trap collections.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies use quantitative measures to evaluate retention, advancement, and success in academic settings. Such approaches, however, present challenges for evaluating the lived experiences of academics. Here, we present a qualitative thematic analysis of self-reports of positive and negative experiences that occurred while conducting academic field research. Twenty-six semistructured interviews highlighted two central themes: (1) variability in clarity of appropriate professional behavior and rules at fieldsites, and (2) access, or obstacles therein, to professional resources and opportunity. In some instances, respondent narratives recalled a lack of consequences for violations of rules governing appropriate conduct. These violations included harassment and assault, and ultimately disruptions to career trajectories. A heuristic construct of a traffic light describing Red, Yellow, and Green experiences illustrates the ramifications of this distribution of clarity and access within fieldsite contexts. These results extend the findings from our previously reported Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE) about the climates and contexts created and experienced in field research settings. Moreover, this study addresses specific tactics, such as policies, procedures, and paradigms that fieldsite directors and principal investigators can implement to improve field experiences and better achieve equal opportunity in field research settings.

To gain a better understanding of microbial community variability, monthly samples of bacterial biomass were collected in 1995–1996 along a 34-km transect near the Long-Term Ecosystem Observatory (LEO-15) off the New Jersey coast. Surface and bottom sampling was performed at seven stations along a transect line with depths ranging from 1 to 35~m (n=178). Microbial populations were fingerprinted using ribosomal 16S rRNA genes and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results from cluster analysis revealed distinct temporal patterns among the bacterioplankton communities in the Mid-Atlantic Bight rather than grouping by sample location or depth. Principal components analysis models supported the temporal patterns. In addition, partial least squares regression modeling could not discern a significant correlation from traditional oceanographic physical and phytoplankton nutrient parameters on overall bacterial community variability patterns at LEO-15. These results suggest factors not traditionally measured during oceanographic studies are structuring coastal microbial communities.},

Parallel cultures were amended with equimolar quantities of four DO13C substrates to simultaneously evaluate community utilization and population-specific incorporation. Of the substrates tested – two cyanobacterial products (exudates or lysates from a culture of Synechococcus) and two defined monosaccharides (glucose or gluconic acid) – the cyanobacterial exudates were incorporated by the greatest diversity of oligotrophic bacterioplankton populations in surface waters, including taxa from {$>$} 10 major subclades within the Flavobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria (including SAR11). In contrast, the monosaccharide glucose was not incorporated by any taxa belonging to extant oligotrophic oceanic clades. Conversely, proteobacterial copiotrophs, which were rare in the ambient water ({$<$} 0.1\% of sequences), grew rapidly on all DOC amendments at both depths, but with different substrate preferences among lineages. We present a new analytical framework for using SIP to detect DOC incorporation across diverse oligotrophic bacterioplankton and discuss implications for the ecology of bacterial–DOC interactions among populations of diverging trophic strategies.},

  abstract = {The Biological Carbon Pump includes all those processes in the ocean that cause organic carbon formed photosynthetically by phytoplankton (primary production) in the sunlit surface layer (the euphotic zone) to be removed from contact with the atmosphere. It is a mechanism that sequesters carbon dioxide (CO2) for weeks to hundreds or even millions of years (geological time-scales). Together with the physical carbon pump, the biological carbon pump constitutes the ocean's CO2 sink, and these two major processes in the global carbon cycle have removed about 2- 2.5 Pg Carbon per year (last decade average)(I Pg=1015g). Today, about half of the CO2 emitted from fossil fuel burning and land use changes remains in the atmosphere, and the other half is captured by land sinks and the ocean. The modern carbon cycle is often completely separated from the short- and long-term carbon cycles of the geological past, and students from biology or biogeochemistry rarely learn about these processes and the respective timescales in a joint lecture. The purpose of this interdisciplinary lecture thus is to cover processes related to the biological carbon pump and how it functions, while paying close attention to the relevant timescales in the global carbon cycle. Note that we focus mainly on the production and sinking of particulates, we do not delve into detailed mechanisms of carbon sequestration due to the removal of dissolved organic matter. Topics will include an introduction to the different carbon pumps (biological, carbonate and physical), followed by a detailed process-oriented introduction to the biological carbon pumps. This will also include the organismal aspects, such as an introduction to phytoplankton, primary production, distribution of primary producers in the global ocean, and the role of zooplankton in the biological carbon pump. More mechanistic aspects follow, such as the concepts of new and export production, the flux attenuation and the role of mineral ballasting. We cover specific aspects of the lecture as modules (Excursions) that give the reader/lecturer the chance to explore some topics in greater detail. These 'Excursions' are entitled 'Instrumentation: Quantifying Particle Flux', 'Particle Sinking and Degradation' and 'The Biological Carbon Pump on Geological Timescales'. The lecture is intended for senior undergraduates/graduates students and can be used in courses such as Oceanography, Biogeochemistry, Geology, and Environmental Life Sciences.},

  abstract = {Ammonia oxidation rates and ammonia-oxidizer community structure were examined in a depth profile (20-2000 m) at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study site in December 2009. Ammonia oxidation rates, measured from trace additions of (NH4+)-N-15 (12-18 nmol L-1), ranged from undetectable at the surface and 2000 m to 2.0 +/- 0.1 nmol L-1 d(-1) at 120 m, the depth of the primary nitrite maximum (PNM). Nitrification was not detectable in the photic zone in December, perhaps in part due to the density structure of the upper water column at this time. Ammonium oxidation rates varied with ammonium concentration and yielded an estimate for the half-saturation constant of 65 +/- 41 nmol L-1 for the assemblage at 100 m. This value is similar to that reported for the cultivated marine ammonia-oxidizing archeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus (134 nmol L-1), confirming the high affinity for ammonium of the in situ community in the Sargasso Sea. Ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) amoA gene copy numbers were two orders of magnitude higher than ammonia-oxidizing bacterial (AOB) amoA gene copy numbers at the PNM depth, suggesting that AOA were responsible for most of the ammonium oxidation, which was in turn responsible for the formation of the PNM. AOB abundance exceeded AOA at depths below 140 m, where both groups were much less abundant. Application of an AOA amoA functional gene microarray showed a diverse and even community distribution. A single archetype (AOA24, representing sequences originally from a coral reef) had the highest fluorescence ratio at depths of 0-1000 m.},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as “modularity” over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

There was a marked intra-annual variability in fluxes of mass, particulate inorganic carbon (PIC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and opal, appearing as two major flux events in each year. In 1989, the first flux event represented the settlement of spring bloom-type material, whereas the second, in autumn, was heavily enriched in mucopolysaccharides. In 1990, in contrast, the two flux events comprised spring bloom-type material and arrived at depth at different times relative to the 1989 events. The intra- and interannual variability evident for all three biogenic components was most notable for POC: (i) the autumn 1989 event supplied twice as much POC to 3100 m as the earlier spring bloom settlement—a quite unexpected observation—and (ii) the annual average POC flux in 1989 was 3–4 times more than in 1990. A synthesis of process study datasets with sediment trap data enables an evaluation of the coupling of deep fluxes with surface-water events. Spatial variability of the 1989 deep flux events is assessed by comparing the sediment trap data reported here with those from a second site ∼ 100 km away (Honjo and Manganini,Deep-Sea Research II,40, 587–607, 1993). The timing and magnitude of the 1989 spring bloom settlement was indistinguishable in the two datasets, indicating no spatial variability in flux between these sites. In contrast, the autumn 1989 flux event was barely recorded at the second site. Given the biogeochemical importance of this latter event to deep waters, most notable in terms of its contribution to POC flux, this observation of deep-water mesoscale flux variability indicates a significant problem in determining regional carbon budgets. Construction of basin-scale budgets is a central goal of JGOFS and for this to be achieved further studies of mesoscale variability of particle flux are essential.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of freshwater runoff plume dynamics in southern California is important for management of coastal water quality, because river discharge associated with episodic winter rainstorms can be a major source of pollutants and pathogens to coastal waters. The purpose of this study was to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of plumes at the San Pedro Shelf in southern California and identify factors influencing the incidence and dispersal patterns of plumes. We used 1.1-km spatial resolution satellite images collected in 1997-2003 by the SeaWiFS optical radiometer. The area of each plume was detected by the backscattering characteristics of surface waters in the vicinity of the mouths of four rivers that discharge to the San Pedro Basin. The rainstorm magnitude was estimated from atmospheric precipitation averaged over the total area of local watersheds. The plume size estimated from the backscattering coefficient nLw555{$>$}1.3 mW cm-2 [mu]m-1 sr-1 was highly correlated with the amount of rainwater precipitated over the watershed area and accumulated during the period preceding the plume. The relation between rainstorm and plume area was linear with zero intercept: that means that the minimum rainstorm magnitude under which no plume occurred in the study area was almost zero, and even small precipitation resulted in a plume. The persistence of the plumes was estimated by fitting the coefficients of the model of plume water dissipation to achieve maximum correlation between the plume area and rainstorm: Twenty-five percent of rainwater dissipated daily, which gradually decreased the plume size. The size, alongshore and cross-shelf translocation of the plumes were modulated slightly by the local circulation, forced remotely by the equatorward wind a few hundred km to the south (along the coast of Baja California). The influence of tidal circulation on the plume area was slight and statistically insignificant.},

All parameters exhibited evident seasonal patterns of variation.

Short-period ({$<$}100 days) variations of remote-sensed chlorophyll biomass were mostly typical to spring seasons. Chlorophyll biomass was significantly correlated with air temperature and wind stress: an increase of chlorophyll biomass followed with 5–6-day time lag an increase of wind stress accompanied by a simultaneous decrease of air temperature. The mechanism of these variations was an intensification of phytoplankton growth resulting from the mixing of water column by wind stress and entrainment of nutrients into the euphotic layer.},

  abstract = {Deep sequencing of untreated sewage provides an opportunity to monitor enteric infections in large populations and for high-throughput viral discovery. A metagenomics analysis of purified viral particles in untreated sewage from the United States (San Francisco, CA), Nigeria (Maiduguri), Thailand (Bangkok), and Nepal (Kathmandu) revealed sequences related to 29 eukaryotic viral families infecting vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants (BLASTx E score, {$<$}10−4), including known pathogens ({$>$}90\% protein identities) in numerous viral families infecting humans (Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Hepeviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Reoviridae), plants (Alphaflexiviridae, Betaflexiviridae, Partitiviridae, Sobemovirus, Secoviridae, Tombusviridae, Tymoviridae, Virgaviridae), and insects (Dicistroviridae, Nodaviridae, and Parvoviridae). The full and partial genomes of a novel kobuvirus, salivirus, and sapovirus are described. A novel astrovirus (casa astrovirus) basal to those infecting mammals and birds, potentially representing a third astrovirus genus, was partially characterized. Potential new genera and families of viruses distantly related to members of the single-stranded RNA picorna-like virus superfamily were genetically characterized and named Picalivirus, Secalivirus, Hepelivirus, Nedicistrovirus, Cadicistrovirus, and Niflavirus. Phylogenetic analysis placed these highly divergent genomes near the root of the picorna-like virus superfamily, with possible vertebrate, plant, or arthropod hosts inferred from nucleotide composition analysis. Circular DNA genomes distantly related to the plant-infecting Geminiviridae family were named Baminivirus, Nimivirus, and Niminivirus. These results highlight the utility of analyzing sewage to monitor shedding of viral pathogens and the high viral diversity found in this common pollutant and provide genetic information to facilitate future studies of these newly characterized viruses.},

  abstract = {Constructed wetlands are used to treat acid drainage from surface or underground coal mines. However, little is known about the microbial communities in the receiving wetland cells. The purpose of this work was to characterize the microbial population present in a wetland that was receiving acid coal mine drainage (AMD). Samples were collected from the oxic sediment zone of a constructed wetland cell in southeastern Ohio that was treating acid drainage from an underground coal mine seep. Samples comprised Fe(III) precipitates and were pretreated with ammonium oxalate to remove interfering iron, and the DNA was extracted and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to amplification of portions of the 16S rRNA gene. Amplified products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and DNA from seven distinct bands was excised from the gel and sequenced. The sequences were matched to sequences in the GenBank bacterial 16S rDNA database. The DNA in two of the bands yielded matches with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and the DNA in each of the remaining five bands was consistent with one of the following microorganisms: Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, strain TRA3-20 (a eubacterium), strain BEN-4 (an arsenite-oxidizing bacterium), an Alcaligenes sp., and a Bordetella sp. Low bacterial diversity in these samples reflects the highly inorganic nature of the oxic sediment layer where high abundance of iron- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria would be expected. The results we obtained by molecular methods supported our findings, obtained using culture methods, that the dominant microbial species in an acid receiving, oxic wetland are A. thiooxidans and A. ferrooxidans.},

To investigate the impact of particle aggregation on global model performance, we carried out a sensitivity study with different parameterisations of marine aggregates and two different model resolutions. Model performance was investigated with respect to global nutrient and oxygen concentrations, as well as extent and location of OMZs. Results show that including an aggregation model improves the representation of OMZs. Moreover, we found that besides a fine spatial resolution of the model grid, the consideration of porous particles, an intermediate-to-high particle sinking speed and a moderateto-high stickiness improve the model fit to both global distributions of dissolved inorganic tracers and regional patterns of OMZs, compared to a model without aggregation. Our model results therefore suggest that improvements not only in the model physics but also in the description of particle aggregation processes can play a substantial role in improving the representation of dissolved inorganic tracers and OMZs on a global scale. However, dissolved inorganic tracers are apparently not sufficient for a global model calibration, which could necessitate global model calibration against a global observational dataset of marine organic particles.},

Over 60\% of Ant4D3 and Arctic96B-16 cells incorporated leucine, while only 25\% of SAR86 cells were active in both summer and fall. We also explored using the size of the FISH image as another measure of single-cell activity. There was a linear relationship between FISH cell size and incorporation of leucine for all bacteria, Ant4D3, and Arctic96B-16, but not for SAR86. FISH sizes of SAR86 cells were at least three-fold smaller than cells in the other clades. Our results suggest slow growth of SAR86 in the perennially cold waters of the West Antarctic Peninsula.},

  abstract = {In July 1999, California's ocean recreational bacterial water quality standards were changed from a total coliform (TC) test to a standard requiring testing for all three bacterial indicators: TC, fecal coliforms (FC), and enterococci (EC). To compare the relationship between the bacterial indicators, and the effect that changing the standards would have on recreational water regulatory actions, three regional studies were conducted along the southern California shoreline from Santa Barbara to San Diego, California. Two studies were conducted during dry weather and one following a large storm event. In each study, samples were collected at over 200 sites which were selected using a stratified random design, with strata consisting of open beach areas and rocky shoreline, and areas near freshwater outlets that drain land-based runoff. During the dry weather studies, samples were collected once per week for 5 weeks. For the storm event study, sampling occurred on a single day about 24h following the storm. The three indicator bacteria were measured at each site and the results were compared to the single sample standards (TC{$>$}10,000; FC{$>$}400 and EC{$>$}104MPN or cfu/100ml). EC was the indicator that failed the single sample standards most often. During the wet weather study, 99\% of all standard failures were detected using EC, compared with only 56\% for FC, and 40\% for TC. During the Summer Study, EC was again the indicator that failed the single sample standards most often, with 60\% of the failures for EC alone. The increased failure of the EC standard occurred consistently regardless of whether the sample was collected at a beach or rocky shoreline site, or at a site near a freshwater outlet. Agreement among indicators was better during wet weather than during dry weather. During dry weather, agreement among indicators was better near freshwater outlets than along open shoreline. Cumulatively, our results suggest that replacement of a TC standard with an EC standard will lead to a five-fold increase in failures during dry weather and a doubling of failures during wet weather. Replacing a TC standard with one based on all three indicators will lead to an eight-fold increase in failures. Changes in the requirements for water quality testing have strong implications for increases in beach closures and restrictions.},

  abstract = {Marine snow plays a key role in the global carbon cycle because it transfers huge amounts of carbon dioxide (around 1-2 Gt per year) from the ocean surface to the deep-sea, thus removing it from the global system. It is of major field of study for several decades to quantify the amount of particulate matter settling through the water column. A central parameter for ocean mass flux estimates is the settling velocity of larger particles. Most of the few available datasets have been acquired by Scuba divers but are they are limited to a diving depth of a few tenth of meters. Particle settling speeds for the deeper water column may be estimated with the help of sediment trap recordings, having the disadvantage to integrate settling speeds over a long period of time and for the entire particle population settling through the water column. In situ sinking speed measurements of individual aggregates however, are rare and difficult to obtain. We present results from a settling chamber constructed for in situ sinking speed measurements of marine snow. The settling chamber was mounted to the MARUM Cherokee ROV during RV Poseidon Cruise 365 in 2008 off Cape Blanc, Mauritania. It was constructed in consideration of a similar device used by the MBARI ROV Ventana. It is a simple plexiglas box which can be opened and closed to allow an infinite number of measurements with little disturbance inside. A collimated light source illuminates a defined sample volume in which aggregates can be observed after the box has been closed. We sampled a total of 51 aggregates at four depth levels, between 50m and 400m water depth. The depths were chosen after collecting a vertical particle profile acquired by a deep-sea still image camera system before the deployment of the ROV. Sinking speeds ranged from 10m d-1to 287 m d-1 with a mean value of 57 m d-1. No clear relationsship between the size of the particles and their sinking speed was found. Furthermore we could not observe increasing particle sinking speeds with increasing water depth as found by other authors. This underlines the complexity of such studies and implies more deployments during upcoming cruises and comparison of in situ measurements with additional methods in the future.},

  abstract = {Environmental context Marine microbial communities, which play a crucial role in all biogeochemical processes in the oceans, could be affected by microplastic pollution. Research is necessary to understand the interactions between marine microbial communities and microplastics, and to explore the potential for microplastics to serve as transport systems for pathogenic microorganisms. Our review summarises first insights into these topics and discusses gaps in our current knowledge. Abstract The accumulation of plastic in the marine environment is a long-known issue, but the potential relevance of this pollution for the ocean has been recognised only recently. Within this context, microplastic fragments ({$<$}5mm) represent an emerging topic. Owing to their small size, they are readily ingested by marine wildlife and can accumulate in the food web, along with associated toxins and microorganisms colonising the plastic. We are starting to understand that plastic biofilms are diverse and are, comparably with non-plastic biofilms, driven by a complex network of influences, mainly spatial and seasonal factors, but also polymer type, texture and size of the substratum. Within this context, we should raise the question about the potential of plastic particles to serve as vectors for harmful microorganisms. The main focus of the review is the discussion of first insights and research gaps related to microplastic-associated microbial biofilm communities.},

Specifically, the ReTOOL program aims to foster the capacity for scientific research among underserved populations as well as address the cultural appropriateness of research projects. This paper describes the impact of the ReTOOL program in enhancing the research training of underrepresented minority (URM) students. Forty URM students who completed the ReTOOL program between 2012 and 2019 were invited to participate in the program evaluation. The response rate was 73\% with 29 participants. Of the 29 participants, 26 trainees self-identified as Black or African-American. A structured survey developed for the program was employed for data collection, using a Likert Scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best. The item ratings ranged from 4.45 to 4.80. Responses to open-ended questions show that ReTOOL has been instrumental in socializing and acculturating participants into the habits of scientific thinking. The combined use of quantitative and qualitative inquiry depicts that ReTOOL has been highly successful in fostering participant enrollment in advanced health-related or professional degree programs.},

Here we show that in the economically and environmentally important microbial communities in a wastewater treatment plant, the population dynamics are consistent with neutral community assembly, where chance and random immigration play an important and predictable role in shaping the communities. Using dynamic observations, we demonstrate a straightforward calibration of a purely neutral model and a parsimonious method to incorporate environmental influence on the reproduction (or birth) rate of individual taxa. The calibrated model parameters are biologically plausible, with the population turnover and diversity in the heterotrophic community being higher than for the ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and immigration into AOB community being relatively higher. When environmental factors were incorporated more of the variance in the observations could be explained but immigration and random reproduction and deaths remained the dominant driver in determining the relative abundance of the common taxa. Consequently we suggest that neutral community models should be the foundation of any description of an open biological system.},

A prevalent, but poorly explored pattern is ecological modularity, with weakly interlinked subsets of species (modules), which, however, internally consist of strongly connected species. The importance of modularity has been discussed for a long time, but no consensus on its prevalence in ecological networks has yet been reached. Progress is hampered by inadequate methods and a lack of large datasets. We analyzed 51 pollination networks including almost 10,000 species and 20,000 links and tested for modularity by using a recently developed simulated annealing algorithm. All networks with {$>$}150 plant and pollinator species were modular, whereas networks with {$<$}50 species were never modular. Both module number and size increased with species number. Each module includes one or a few species groups with convergent trait sets that may be considered as coevolutionary units. Species played different roles with respect to modularity. However, only 15\% of all species were structurally important to their network. They were either hubs (i.e., highly linked species within their own module), connectors linking different modules, or both. If these key species go extinct, modules and networks may break apart and initiate cascades of extinction. Thus, species serving as hubs and connectors should receive high conservation priorities.},

  abstract = {Down with atmospheric carbon dioxide How does the ocean move carbon from surface waters to its deep interior? Current understanding is that carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by phytoplankton that are eaten, and in turn their predators die and sink into deep water and seafloor sediments. In addition to this route, Omand et al. show that downwelling caused by ocean eddies 1 to 10 km across can deliver much of the carbon produced in spring to the deep sea. The eddies entrain small particles and dissolved organic carbon to augment the flux of large sinking particles. Science, this issue p. 222 The export of particulate organic carbon (POC) from the surface ocean to depth is traditionally ascribed to sinking. Here, we show that a dynamic eddying flow field subducts surface water with high concentrations of nonsinking POC. Autonomous observations made by gliders during the North Atlantic spring bloom reveal anomalous features at depths of 100 to 350 meters with elevated POC, chlorophyll, oxygen, and temperature-salinity characteristics of surface water. High-resolution modeling reveals that during the spring transition, intrusions of POC-rich surface water descend as coherent, 1- to 10-kilometer–scale filamentous features, often along the perimeter of eddies. Such a submesoscale eddy-driven flux of POC is unresolved in global carbon cycle models but can contribute as much as half of the total springtime export of POC from the highly productive subpolar oceans.},

  abstract = {The sinking of organic particles produced in the upper sunlit layers of the ocean forms an important limb of the oceanic biological pump, which impacts the sequestration of carbon and resupply of nutrients in the mesopelagic ocean. Particles raining out from the upper ocean undergo remineralization by bacteria colonized on their surface and interior, leading to an attenuation in the sinking flux of organic matter with depth. Here, we formulate a mechanistic model for the depth-dependent, sinking, particulate mass flux constituted by a range of sinking, remineralizing particles. Like previous studies, we find that the model does not achieve the characteristic ‘Martin curve’ flux profile with a single type of particle, but instead requires a distribution of particle sizes and/or properties. We consider various functional forms of remineralization appropriate for solid/compact particles, and aggregates with an anoxic or oxic interior. We explore the sensitivity of the shape of the flux vs. depth profile to the choice of remineralization function, relative particle density, particle size distribution, and water column density stratification, and find that neither a power-law nor exponential function provides a definitively superior fit to the modeled profiles. The profiles are also sensitive to the time history of the particle source. Varying surface particle size distribution (via the slope of the particle number spectrum) over 3 days to represent a transient phytoplankton bloom results in transient subsurface maxima or pulses in the sinking mass flux. This work contributes to a growing body of mechanistic export flux models that offer scope to incorporate underlying dynamical and biological processes into global carbon cycle models.},

At least four, and possibly 11, microcystins were detected in cell-free extracts. Live bloom material was cultured at salt concentrations up to 21.2 g L–1 (total salts). The cultures were salt tolerant up to 9.8 g L–1. Reduction in the total cell concentration in the first 23 h was only observed in the highest salt treatment and first-order rate constants for cell lysis were higher than the rates for reduction of the intracellular microcystin pool size for that treatment. This suggests preferential lysis of genotypes with lower salinity tolerance and toxigenicity. This increased the toxicity of the mixed bloom population and the apparent microcystin cell quota without any change to the intracellular microcystin pool size. Therefore, the toxicity of bloom material may change through preferential lysis of cells with lower tolerances to changing environmental conditions, including salinity. Managers should be aware that the World Health Organization alert levels of 105 cells mL–1 for human contact exposure to cyanobacteria may not be a suitable prima facie test during these periods.},

Although metagenomics is currently used to explore microbial communities, its application has not been as extensive in aquaculture. Although some taxonomic profiles and phylogenetic studies have been deciphered using biomarker genes, the functional potential of microbial communities associated with aquaculture systems is still unknown in most cases. Predicting functional profiles through 16S rRNA gene-based metagenomics analysis is perhaps the most promising tool to elucidate the metabolic capabilities of microbial communities because there is no need to perform shotgun sequencing to have an idea of these capabilities. Moreover, robust bioinformatics background is not required to assess this information, and so the same data (16S rRNA sequences) are used to estimate both taxonomic and functional profiles, therefore providing deeper insights into these kinds of communities. In this review, we suggest the need to major use of novel bioinformatics tools that construct functional profiles from metagenomic 16S rRNA data, as strategy to obtain a preliminary approach about metabolic capacities of microbes that coexist in aquaculture systems.},

Among the bacterial cells tested, Microbacterium schleiferi and Arthrobacter sp. exhibited elevated resistance to 254-nm UV irradiation (low-pressure Hg lamp), and their survival indices were comparable to those of DS- and DSE-associated Bacillus pumilus spores. Desiccated DSE-associated spores survived exposure to full Martian UV irradiation (200 to 400 nm) for 5 min and were only slightly affected by Martian atmospheric conditions in the absence of UV irradiation. Although prolonged UV irradiation (5 min to 12 h) killed substantial portions of the spores in DSE microcosms (∼5- to 6-log reduction with Martian UV irradiation), dramatic survival of spores was apparent in DS-spore microcosms.

Yet for logistical reasons, this temporal scale is typically under-sampled in the marine environment. In order to facilitate higher-resolution, long-term observation of microbial diversity and activity, we developed a protocol for automated collection and fixation of marine microbes using the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) platform. The protocol applies a preservative (RNALater) to cells collected on filters, for long-term storage and preservation of total cellular RNA. Microbial samples preserved using this protocol yielded high-quality RNA after 30 days of storage at room temperature, or onboard the ESP at in situ temperatures. Pyrosequencing of complementary DNA libraries generated from ESP-collected and preserved samples yielded transcript abundance profiles nearly indistinguishable from those derived from conventionally treated replicate samples. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we used a moored ESP to remotely and autonomously collect Monterey Bay seawater for metatranscriptomic analysis. Community RNA was extracted and pyrosequenced from samples collected at four time points over the course of a single day. In all four samples, the oxygenic photoautotrophs were predominantly eukaryotic, while the bacterial community was dominated by Polaribacter-like Flavobacteria and a Rhodobacterales bacterium sharing high similarity with Rhodobacterales sp. HTCC2255. However, each time point was associated with distinct species abundance and gene transcript profiles. These laboratory and field tests confirmed that autonomous collection and preservation is a feasible and useful approach for characterizing the expressed genes and environmental responses of marine microbial communities.

The kinetics, regularity, and specificity of microbial responses in situ, however, are not well-described. We report here simultaneous multitaxon genome-wide transcriptome profiling in a naturally occurring picoplankton community. An in situ robotic sampler using a Lagrangian sampling strategy enabled continuous tracking and repeated sampling of coherent microbial populations over 2 d. Subsequent RNA sequencing analyses yielded genome-wide transcriptome profiles of eukaryotic (Ostreococcus) and bacterial (Synechococcus) photosynthetic picoplankton as well as proteorhodopsin-containing heterotrophs, including Pelagibacter, SAR86-cluster Gammaproteobacteria, and marine Euryarchaea. The photosynthetic picoplankton exhibited strong diel rhythms over thousands of gene transcripts that were remarkably consistent with diel cycling observed in laboratory pure cultures. In contrast, the heterotrophs did not cycle diurnally. Instead, heterotrophic picoplankton populations exhibited cross-species synchronous, tightly regulated, temporally variable patterns of gene expression for many genes, particularly those genes associated with growth and nutrient acquisition. This multitaxon, population-wide gene regulation seemed to reflect sporadic, short-term, reversible responses to high-frequency environmental variability. Although the timing of the environmental responses among different heterotrophic species seemed synchronous, the specific metabolic genes that were expressed varied from taxon to taxon. In aggregate, these results provide insights into the kinetics, diversity, and functional patterns of microbial community response to environmental change. Our results also suggest a means by which complex multispecies metabolic processes could be coordinated, facilitating the regulation of matter and energy processing in a dynamically changing environment.},

  abstract = {Neighborhoods are an important source of inequality, and neighborhood change may lead to changing opportunities for residents. Past research on neighborhood upgrading tends to focus on one process: gentrification. I argue that a broader range of types of neighborhood socioeconomic ascent requires examination. This article documents the different types of neighborhoods ascending from 1970 to the present. Using principal components analysis and cluster analysis, I report the prevalence of socioeconomic ascent, based on increases in neighborhood income, rents, house values, and educational and occupational attainment, among five to seven types of neighborhoods in each decade. I also examine population and housing changes that co-occur with ascent to identify processes of ascent beyond gentrification. Overall, findings suggest mixed implications for neighborhood inequality. While white suburban neighborhoods make up the bulk of neighborhoods that ascend in each decade, minority and immigrant neighborhoods become increasingly likely to ascend over time, though displacement may occur.},

A survey of Sierra Nevada mountain lakes and pelagic and near-shore waters in the Pacific Ocean indicates that attachment is most noticeable in the near-surface waters where fresh dissolved and particulate input of carbon from phytoplankton and elevated temperatures favor microbial growth. The most common modes of attachment are: adhesive stalk formation, growth on adhesive webs, attachment by the use of pili-like appendages and slimy capsular secretions, and molecular or chemical sorption without the use of visualized structural appendages. Attached microbial growth is accelerated when particulate substrates are supplied, even when they are not rich in organic nutrients. This is the case in the Lake Tahoe basin, where microflora attached to eroded silts can significantly modify the organic carbon and nutrient content of such minerogenous particles.},

Prokaryote survival and proliferation in aquatic environments is often controlled by the ability to tolerate exposure to oxic conditions. Many prokaryotes do not have subcellular organelles for isolating O-2-producing from O-2-consuming processes and have developed consortial associations with other prokaryotes and eukaryotes that alleviate metabolic constraints of high O-2. Nutrient transformations often rely on appropriate cellular and microenvironmental, or microzonal, redox conditions. The spatial and temporal requirements for microenvironmental overlap among microbial groups involved in nutrient transformations necessitates close proximity and diffusional exchange with other biogeochemically distinct, yet complementary, microbial groups. Microbial consortia exist at different levels of community and metabolic complexity, as shown for detrital, microbial mat, biofilm, and planktonic microalgal-bacterial assemblages. To assess the macroscale impacts of consortial interactions, studies should focus on the range of relevant temporal (minutes to hours) and spatial (microns to centimeters) scales controlling microbial production, nutrient exchange, and cycling. In this review, we discuss the utility and application of techniques suitable for determining microscale consortial activity, production, community composition, and interactions in the context of larger scale aquatic ecosystem structure and function.},

  abstract = {Ships’ ballast water (BW) commonly moves macroorganisms and microorganisms across the world’s oceans and along coasts; however, the majority of these microbial transfers have gone undetected. We applied high-throughput sequencing methods to identify microbial eukaryotes, specifically emphasizing the protistan parasites, in ships’ BW collected from vessels calling to the Chesapeake Bay (Virginia and Maryland, USA) from European and Eastern Canadian ports. We utilized tagged-amplicon 454 pyrosequencing with two general primer sets, amplifying either the V4 or V9 domain of the small subunit (SSU) of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene complex, from total DNA extracted from water samples collected from the ballast tanks of bulk cargo vessels. We detected a diverse group of protistan taxa, with some known to contain important parasites in marine systems, including Apicomplexa (unidentified apicomplexans, unidentified gregarines, Cryptosporidium spp.), Dinophyta (Blastodinium spp., Euduboscquella sp., unidentified syndinids, Karlodinium spp., Syndinium spp.), Perkinsea (Parvilucifera sp.), Opisthokonta (Ichthyosporea sp., Pseudoperkinsidae, unidentified ichthyosporeans), and Stramenopiles (Labyrinthulomycetes). Further characterization of groups with parasitic taxa, consisting of phylogenetic analyses for four taxa (Cryptosporidium spp., Parvilucifera spp., Labyrinthulomycetes, and Ichthyosporea), revealed that sequences were obtained from both known and novel lineages. This study demonstrates that high-throughput sequencing is a viable and sensitive method for detecting parasitic protists when present and transported in the ballast water of ships. These data also underscore the potential importance of human-aided dispersal in the biogeography of these microbes and emerging diseases in the world’s oceans.},

  abstract = {Niche differentiation and ecological filtering are primary ecological processes that shape community assembly, but their relative importance remains poorly understood. Analyses of the distributions of functional traits can provide insight into the community structure generated by these processes. We predicted the trait distributions expected under the ecological processes of niche differentiation and environmental filtering, then tested these predictions with a dataset of 4672 trees located in nine 1-ha plots of tropical rain forest in French Guiana. Five traits related to leaf function (foliar N concentration, chlorophyll content, toughness, tissue density and specific leaf area), and three traits related to stem function (trunk sapwood density, branch sapwood density, and trunk bark thickness), as well as laminar surface area, were measured on every individual tree. There was far more evidence for environmental filtering than for niche differentiation in these forests. Furthermore, we contrasted results from species-mean and individual-level trait values. Analyses that took within-species trait variation into account were far more sensitive indicators of niche differentiation and ecological filtering. Species-mean analyses, by contrast, may underestimate the effects of ecological processes on community assembly. Environmental filtering appeared somewhat more intense on leaf traits than on stem traits, whereas niche differentiation affected neither strongly. By accounting for within-species trait variation, we were able to more properly consider the ecological interactions among individual trees and between individual trees and their environment. In so doing, our results suggest that the ecological processes of niche differentiation and environmental filtering may be more pervasive than previously believed.},

We studied island-like hot spring cyanobacterial communities in which geographical isolation should be prominent and detectable if it influences the evolution of bacteria. The genetic diversity of cyanobacteria indigenous to North American, Japanese, New Zealand and Italian springs was surveyed by (i) amplification and cloning of 16S rRNA and 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer regions; (ii) lineage-specific oligonucleotide probing (used to verify the predominance of cloned sequences); and (iii) lineage-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (used to search for possible rare genotypes). Phylogenetic and distribution patterns were found to be consistent with the occurrence of geographical isolation at both global and local spatial scales, although different cyanobacterial lineages were found to vary in their distribution. A lack of correspondence between biological patterning and the chemical character of springs sampled suggested that the geographical distribution of thermophilic cyanobacteria cannot be explained by the 20 potential niche-determining chemical parameters that we assayed. Thus, geographical isolation (i.e. genetic drift) must in part be responsible for driving the observed evolutionary divergences. Geographical isolation may be an important underestimated aspect of microbial evolution.},

We found the popular primer pair 515F (515F-C) and 806R greatly underestimated (e.g. SAR11) or overestimated (e.g. Gammaproteobacteria) common marine taxa. We evaluated marine samples and mock communities (containing 11 or 27 marine 16S clones), showing alternative primers 515F-Y (5′-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (5′-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) yield more accurate estimates of mock community abundances, produce longer amplicons that can differentiate taxa unresolvable with 515F-C/806R, and amplify eukaryotic 18S rRNA. Mock communities amplified with 515F-Y/926R yielded closer observed community composition versus expected (r2 = 0.95) compared with 515F-Y/806R (r2 ∼ 0.5). Unexpectedly, biases with 515F-Y/806R against SAR11 in field samples (∼4–10-fold) were stronger than in mock communities (∼2-fold). Correcting a mismatch to Thaumarchaea in the 515F-C increased their apparent abundance in field samples, but not as much as using 926R rather than 806R. With plankton samples rich in eukaryotic DNA ({$>$} 1 μm size fraction), 18S sequences averaged ∼17\% of all sequences. A single mismatch can strongly bias amplification, but even perfectly matched primers can exhibit preferential amplification. We show that beyond in silico predictions, testing with mock communities and field samples is important in primer selection.},

Studies of nekton responses to OML in marine ecosystems have primarily occurred in deep, offshore regions with thick, persistent OMLs. Our study examined the response of pelagic nekton to an OML in a shallow temperate fjord, Hood Canal, WA, U.S.A. Using acoustics, we quantified vertical distribution of nekton at two sites (Hoodsport and Duckabush) before (July) and after (September) OML development. Both Hoodsport and Duckabush had strong OML between 10 and 35m in September, with lower (minimum 0.63mgL−1) oxygen levels at Hoodsport compared to Duckabush (1.58mgL−1). The OML did not affect daytime distribution of fish or invertebrates, with both occupying depths {$>$}60m. At night in July, with no OML, invertebrates migrated into waters {$<$}20m and fish dispersed to within 15m of the surface at both sites. In the presence of the September OML, invertebrates migrated into waters {$<$}20m, but the upper limit of fish vertical distribution stopped at the base of the OML (35m) at Hoodsport. Fish vertical distribution at Duckabush was less pronounced within and above the OML (10–35m) than it had been in July. Our results suggest that the OML did not affect invertebrate vertical distribution, but did affect fish vertical migration, and may provide a seasonal, diel prey refuge.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing techniques have made large-scale spatial and temporal surveys of microbial communities routine. Gaining insight into microbial diversity requires methods for effectively analyzing and visualizing these extensive data sets. Phylogenetic β-diversity measures address this challenge by allowing the relationship between large numbers of environmental samples to be explored using standard multivariate analysis techniques. Despite the success and widespread use of phylogenetic β-diversity measures, an extensive comparative analysis of these measures has not been performed. Here, we compare 39 measures of phylogenetic β diversity in order to establish the relative similarity of these measures along with key properties and performance characteristics. While many measures are highly correlated, those commonly used within microbial ecology were found to be distinct from those popular within classical ecology, and from the recently recommended Gower and Canberra measures. Many of the measures are surprisingly robust to different rootings of the gene tree, the choice of similarity threshold used to define operational taxonomic units, and the presence of outlying basal lineages. Measures differ considerably in their sensitivity to rare organisms, and the effectiveness of measures can vary substantially under alternative models of differentiation. Consequently, the depth of sequencing required to reveal underlying patterns of relationships between environmental samples depends on the selected measure. Our results demonstrate that using complementary measures of phylogenetic β diversity can further our understanding of how communities are phylogenetically differentiated. Open-source software implementing the phylogenetic β-diversity measures evaluated in this manuscript is available at http://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software/ExpressBetaDiversity.},

  abstract = {The effects of sewage discharge on algal populations and the quality of Hawai'ian coastal waters were investigated. Two outfalls were studied. One discharges primary treated sewage and the other discharges secondary treated sewage but are otherwise similar. This enabled comparisons of the effects of these different levels of treatment on the water quality and algal productivity of receiving waters. Plumes were followed and repeatedly sampled in a time-series manner. Rhodamine dye was used as a conservative tracer to compare the dilution behavior of the plume constituents MRP, NO3 + NO2, NH4, Silicate, TDP, TDN, total bacteria, PC, and PN. Rates of initial dilution ranged from two to almost three orders of magnitude, and were in reasonable agreement with engineering model predictions. Dilution of plume constituents approximated that of Rhodamine until background concentrations were reached, typically within 10 min of discharge. Chl a concentrations did not increase through time in the primary sewage plume but did increase up to 30\% in the secondary sewage plume. However, rates of far-field dilution were so rapid that the increase could not have been due to algal growth. The increase Was attributed to the plume mixing with a water mass whose relative chl a concentrations were greater. Rates of secondary dilution ranged from 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. resulting in total dilutions of 10(5)-10(6) within 3 h of discharge. These rates of secondary dilution were much greater than model predictions. From a nutrient standpoint, secondary treatment exhibited no advantages over primary treatment because dilutions were so rapid. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These communities may play pivotal ecological roles through autotrophy, feeding, and a wide range of symbiotic associations with prokaryotes. We used 18S rRNA gene sequencing to provide the first snapshot of pelagic microeukaryotic community structure in two cellular size fractions (0.2-1.6 µm, {$>$}1.6 µm) from seven depths through the anoxic oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off northern Chile. Sequencing of {$>$}154,000 amplicons revealed contrasting patterns of phylogenetic diversity across size fractions and depths. Protist and total eukaryote diversity in the {$>$}1.6 µm fraction peaked at the chlorophyll maximum in the upper photic zone before declining by \textasciitilde 50\% in the OMZ. In contrast, diversity in the 0.2-1.6 µm fraction, though also elevated in the upper photic zone, increased four-fold from the lower oxycline to a maximum at the anoxic OMZ core. Dinoflagellates of the Dinophyceae and endosymbiotic Syndiniales clades dominated the protist assemblage at all depths (\textasciitilde 40-70\% of sequences). Other protist groups varied with depth, with the anoxic zone community of the larger size fraction enriched in euglenozoan flagellates and acantharean radiolarians (up to 18\% and 40\% of all sequences, respectively). The OMZ 0.2-1.6 µm fraction was dominated (11-99\%) by Syndiniales, which exhibited depth-specific variation in composition and total richness despite uniform oxygen conditions. Metazoan sequences, though confined primarily to the 1.6 µm fraction above the OMZ, were also detected within the anoxic zone where groups such as copepods increased in abundance relative to the oxycline and upper OMZ. These data, compared to those from other low-oxygen sites, reveals variation in OMZ microeukaryote composition, helping to identify clades with potential adaptations to oxygen-depletion.},

  abstract = {1. Detection of impairment in macroinvertebrate communities using rapid biological assessment depends on the ability to compare sites, with confidence that differences obtained result from water quality. However, collections from more than one habitat type may introduce variation that can potentially mask water quality differences among sites. Data were collected from the riffle, edge, pool-rock and macrophyte habitats at reference (minimally disturbed) and test (disturbed) stream sites throughout the Australian Capital Territory. The effect of habitat-specific sampling on predictive models for detecting impairment in macroinvertebrate communities was determined. Four models were used: riffle only, edge only, each habitat as an individual object, and all habitats sampled at a site considered as a composite sample. 2. Macroinvertebrates from individual habitats generally clustered into separate groups because collections from the same habitat at different sites were more similar than collections from different habitats within a site. Thus, in the habitats as individual objects model, the taxa predicted to occur at a test site may be an indication of habitat type rather than water quality. The outputs of the composite habitats and riffle and edge models were similar. However, the variable number of habitats included at each site in the composite model may confound the detection of biological impairment because of unequal sampling effort. The riffle and edge models were the most robust because they were less confounded by inter-habitat variation and were based on comparisons made between equivalent environmental units. 3. Comparison of observed/expected taxa ratios for test sites showed that each model could detect biological impairment, indicating considerable data redundancy was introduced by sampling several habitats. In particular, the pool-rock and macrophyte habitats contributed no information with regard to macroinvertebrate taxon occurrence or detection of biological impairment that could not be obtained from either the riffle or edge habitats within the study area.},

  abstract = {The minute photosynthetic prokaryote Prochlorococcus, which was discovered about 10 years ago, has proven exceptional from several standpoints. Its tiny size (0.5 to 0.7 μm in diameter) makes it the smallest known photosynthetic organism. Its ubiquity within the 40°S to 40°N latitudinal band of oceans and its occurrence at high density from the surface down to depths of 200 m make it presumably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. Prochlorococcus typically divides once a day in the subsurface layer of oligotrophic areas, where it dominates the photosynthetic biomass. It also possesses a remarkable pigment complement which includes divinyl derivatives of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and Chl b, the so-called Chl a2 and Chl b2, and, in some strains, small amounts of a new type of phycoerythrin. Phylogenetically, Prochlorococcus has also proven fascinating. Recent studies suggest that it evolved from an ancestral cyanobacterium by reducing its cell and genome sizes and by recruiting a protein originally synthesized under conditions of iron depletion to build a reduced antenna system as a replacement for large phycobilisomes. Environmental constraints clearly played a predominant role in Prochlorococcus evolution. Its tiny size is an advantage for its adaptation to nutrient-deprived environments. Furthermore, genetically distinct ecotypes, with different antenna systems and ecophysiological characteristics, are present at depth and in surface waters. This vertical species variation has allowed Prochlorococcus to adapt to the natural light gradient occurring in the upper layer of oceans. The present review critically assesses the basic knowledge acquired about Prochlorococcus both in the ocean and in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this study were to investigate the seasonal distribution of total and pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the Chesapeake Bay oysters and waters, and to determine the degree of association between V. parahaemolyticus densities and selected environmental parameters. Oyster and water samples were collected monthly from three sites in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland from November 2004 through October 2005. During collection of samples, water temperature, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll a, and fecal coliform levels in oysters were also determined. V. parahaemolyticus levels were enumerated by a quantitative direct-plating method followed by DNA colony hybridization; presence/absence was further determined by overnight broth enrichment followed by either standard colony isolation or real-time PCR. The thermolabile hemolysin (tlh) gene and thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh) gene were targeted for detection of total and pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, respectively, for both direct plating and enrichment. The thermostable related hemolysin (trh) gene, which is a presumptive pathogenicity marker, was targeted only for the enrichment approach. By direct plating, colonies producing tlh signals were detected in 79\% of oyster samples at densities ranging from 1.5×101 to 6.0×102~CFU/g. Pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus (tdh+) was detected in 3\% (level was 10~CFU/g) of oyster samples while no V. parahaemolyticus was detected in water samples. By the enrichment approach with standard colony isolation, 67\% of oyster and 55\% of water samples (n=33) were positive for total V. parahaemolyticus, and all samples were negative for pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus. In contrast, enrichment followed by real-time PCR detected tlh, tdh and trh in 100\%, 20\% and 40\% of oyster and 100\%, 13\% and 40\% of water enrichments collected from June to October 2005, respectively. V. parahaemolyticus densities in oysters varied seasonally and were found to be positively correlated with water temperature, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen.},

  abstract = {A laboratory experiment was designed to investigate the effects of ocean acidification (three levels) in the presence or absence of the clay mineral illite (five concentrations) on the coagulation of organic particles. The formation of aggregates . 1 mm from marine detritus and phytoplankton, and their characteristics and sinking velocity, were monitored during the 48 h experiment. Aggregation of particulate organic carbon (POC) was independent of both partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2 ) and illite addition, implying that the fraction of POC available for export is not affected by either mineral supply or ocean acidification conditions up to ambient + 52.7 Pa PCO2 (+ 520 ppm). This was true even though the illite appreciably influenced aggregate size, number, and characteristics, including the percentage of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) incorporated in aggregates. Carbonate chemistry, in the presence of illite, did affect particle formation by clay, carbon, and TEP at the micrometer scale (allocation between dissolved and particulate pools). Our experiment did not resolve processes on this scale well and it remains to be seen if such shifts in the size spectrum of organic carbon and minerals are relevant for the biological pump. High illite content led to small aggregates with a low average sinking velocity. In the absence of biological changes to particle production or loss, coagulation of POC, which is central to the biological pump, is not influenced by ocean acidification or dust input, but sinking velocity and, hence, flux attenuation of POC are likely to be affected by changes in dust input.},

TEP was found at all stations studied, but abundance and total quantity of TEP varied by 4 orders of magnitude among coastal, slope and oceanic environments. Abundance and size distributions of TEP appeared to be related to plankton composition. Abundance tended to be higher in coastal and shallow waters compared to oceanic and deep waters respectively. The average size of TEP was appreciably larger at stations where diatoms dominated phytoplankton. Size distributions of TEP generally followed a power-law function, except when aggregation dominated interaction of particles. The type of size distribution of TEP may allow us to predict the tendency of a plankton community to aggregate. General differences in the shape of size spectra of TEP indicate TEP generated by diatoms to be stickier and more fractal compared to TEP generated by non-diatom plankton. All TEP were colonized by bacteria, but no correlation was found between numbers of attached bacteria on individual TEP and the respective size of TEP. Bacteria density on TEP, however, decreased with increasing size of TEP exponentially. Between 2 and 25\% of the total bacterial population were attached to TEP. Total number of bacteria were not correlated with total quantity of TEP, suggesting that no simple overall relationship exists between TEP and bacteria.},

  abstract = {Significant amounts of oil accumulated at the sea surface and in a subsurface plume during the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) spill in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) in 2010. A substantial fraction of this oil was removed from the marine environment by mechanical recovery or burning, or it reached shorelines, whereas another fraction remained within the marine environment, where it dispersed (chemically or naturally), emulsified or sedimented. After the DwH accident the sedimentation of hydrocarbons to the seafloor via rapidly sinking, oil-associated marine snow has become a focus of attention, and it has been hypothesized that marine snow formation significantly impacted the distribution of the oil from the DwH spill. Here, roller table experiments are presented that investigated the conditions inducing the formation of oil-associated marine snow, focusing especially on the effects of oil type, photochemical aging of oil, and the presence of phytoplankton or dispersant. Large, mucus-rich marine snow, termed microbial marine snow, formed in treatments incubated with the oil that had accumulated at the sea surface. This bacteria-mediated formation of up to cm-sized marine snow in the absence of particles {$>$}1µm, represents a unique formation pathway different from that of the physical coagulation of particles. Microbial marine snow, albeit smaller, also formed in the presence of crude oil that had been aged for ≥3 weeks in sunlight, but no particles formed in the presence of unaltered crude. The dispersant Corexit 9500A (Corexit:oil ratio=1:100) impeded the formation of microbial marine snow, requiring a re-evaluation of the benefits and detriments of Corexit 9500A as a mediating measure. Phytoplankton aggregates also incorporated fossil carbon, providing an alternate pathway for the formation of oil-associated marine snow. The ubiquitous formation and rapid sedimentation of oil-rich marine snow can explain the high accumulation rate of flocculent material at the seafloor and on corals observed after the DwH spill. These results may raise awareness that oil spill response and assessment need to include sedimentation of hydrocarbons via marine snow as a significant distribution mechanism and may guide future modeling efforts and budget calculations.},

However, the origin of these particles and the factors regulating their formation are not well understood. This study examined several strains of algae and bacteria with respect to their production of TEP or TEP precursors. The formation rate of TEP in batch cultures of algae varied widely between species, and interspecies variability among diatoms was as large as that among species belonging to different classes or even divisions. Species, growth phase and environmental factors acted in concert in determining the accumulation of TEP in algal cultures and no general rules or patterns could be derived. The concentration of TEP during the growth phase of algal batch cultures, mesocosm or natural phytoplankton blooms was a significant function of chlorophyll a, confirming the significance of phytoplankton for the formation of TEP. Experiments with 3 bacterial strains and a natural bacteria population indicated that bacteria are also able to generate TEP, but the role of bacterial derived TEP for in situ TEP concentrations remains unclear.},

  abstract = {Viruses are the most abundant biological entities in aquatic environments, typically exceeding the abundance of bacteria by an order of magnitude. The reliable enumeration of virus-like particles in marine microbiological investigations is a key measurement parameter. Although the size of typical marine viruses (20–200 nm) is too small to permit the resolution of details by light microscopy, such viruses can be visualized by epifluorescence microscopy if stained brightly. This can be achieved using the sensitive DNA dye SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes–Invitrogen). The method relies on simple vacuum filtration to capture viruses on a 0.02-m aluminum oxide filter, and subsequent staining and mounting to prepare slides. Virus-like particles are brightly stained and easily observed for enumeration, and prokaryotic cells can easily be counted on the same slides. The protocol provides an inexpensive, rapid (30 min) and reliable technique for obtaining counts of viruses and prokaryotes simultaneously.},

Three humic lakes were sampled weekly May-August and correlations between relative abundances of specific phytoplankton and bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in each time series were determined. To experimentally characterize the influence of phytoplankton, bacteria from each lake were incubated with phytoplankton from one of the three lakes or no phytoplankton. Following incubation, variation in bacterial community composition explained by phytoplankton treatment increased 65\%, while the variation explained by bacterial source decreased 64\%. Free-living bacteria explained, on average, over 60\% of the difference between phytoplankton and corresponding no-phytoplankton control treatments. Fourteen out of the 101 bacterial OTUs that exhibited positively correlated patterns of abundance with specific algal populations in time-series observations were enriched in mesocosms following incubation with phytoplankton, and one out of 59 negatively correlated bacterial OTUs was depleted in phytoplankton treatments. Bacterial genera enriched in mesocosms containing specific phytoplankton assemblages included Limnohabitans (clade betI-A), Bdellovibrio and Mitsuaria. These results suggest that effects of phytoplankton on certain bacterial populations, including bacteria tracking seasonal changes in algal-derived organic matter, result in correlations between algal and bacterial community dynamics.},

  abstract = {Particulate organic carbon (POC) produced in the surface ocean sinks through the water column and is respired at depth, acting as a primary vector sequestering carbon in the abyssal ocean. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are sensitive to the length (depth) scale over which respiration converts POC back to inorganic carbon, because shallower waters exchange with the atmosphere more rapidly than deeper ones. However, estimates of this carbon regeneration length scale and its spatiotemporal variability are limited, hindering the ability to characterize its sensitivity to environmental conditions. Here, we present a zonal section of POC fluxes at high vertical and spatial resolution from the GEOTRACES GP16 transect in the eastern tropical South Pacific, based on normalization to the radiogenic thorium isotope               230               Th. We find shallower carbon regeneration length scales than previous estimates for the oligotrophic South Pacific gyre, indicating less efficient carbon transfer to the deep ocean. Carbon regeneration is strongly inhibited within suboxic waters near the Peru coast. Canonical Martin curve power laws inadequately capture POC flux profiles at suboxic stations. We instead fit these profiles using an exponential function with flux preserved at depth, finding shallow regeneration but high POC sequestration below 1,000 m. Both regeneration length scales and POC flux at depth closely track the depths at which oxygen concentrations approach zero. Our findings imply that climate warming will result in reduced ocean carbon storage due to expanding oligotrophic gyres, but opposing effects on ocean carbon storage from expanding suboxic waters will require modeling and future work to disentangle.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the value and limitations of using microbial indicators to predict occurrence of enteric pathogens in water. Raw or treated sewage is a primary source of fecal contamination of the receiving surface water or groundwater; hence, understanding the relationship between pathogens and indicators in sewage is an important step in understanding the correlation in receiving waters. This article presents three different datasets representing different concentrations of pathogens and microbial indicators: sewage containing high concentrations of pathogens and indicators, surface water with variable concentrations, and groundwater with low concentrations. In sewage, even with very high levels of microorganisms, no mathematical correlation can predict the type or concentration of any pathogen. After discharge in the environment, direct correlation becomes biologically improbable as dilution, transport, and different inactivation rates occur in various environments. In surface waters, advanced statistical methods such as logistic regression have provided some level of predictability of the occurrence of pathogens but not specific counts. In groundwater, the continuous absence of indicators indicates an improbable occurrence of pathogen. In contrast, when these indicators are detected, pathogen occurrence probability increases significantly. In groundwater, given the nature and dissemination pattern of pathogenic microorganisms, a direct correlation with fecal microbial indicators is not observed and should not be expected. However, the indicators are still useful as a measure of risk. In summary, many pathogens of public health importance do not behave like fecal microbial indicators, and there is still no absolute indicator of their presence, only a probability of their co-occurrence.},

In this study we carried out two experiments with water from a eutrophic temperate fjord to examine whether low-oxygen microenvironments within particulate organic matter could be loci suitable for N2-fixation by these bacteria. First, water enriched with natural particles or sediment showed higher N2-fixation rates than bulk water, and nitrogenase genes (nifH) revealed that specific diazotrophs were affiliated with the particulate matter. Second, pristine artificial surfaces were rapidly colonized by diverse bacteria, while putative diazotrophs emerged relative late (after 80 h) during the colonization, and phylotypes related to Pseudomonas and to anaerobic bacteria became dominant with time. Our study pinpoints natural particles as sites of N2-fixation, and indicates that resuspension of sediment material can elevate pelagic N2-fixation. Moreover, we show that diverse natural diazotrophs have the ability to colonize artificial surfaces, but colonization by ‘pioneer’ bacterioplankton that more rapidly associate with surfaces appears to be a prerequisite. Whereas our experimental study supports the idea of pelagic particles as sites of N2-fixation by heterotrophic bacteria, future in situ studies are needed in order to establish identity, activity and ecology of particle associated NCDs as a function of individual particle characteristics.},

Isolation in pure culture was the only way to identify some of them, but current culturing techniques are unable to isolate most of the bacteria in nature. The recent development of fast and cheap high-throughput sequencing has begun to allow access to the rare species. In the case of bacteria, the exploration of this rare biosphere has several points of interest. First, it will eventually produce a reasonable estimate of the total number of bacterial taxa in the oceans; right now, we do not even know the right order of magnitude. Second, it will answer the question of whether “everything is everywhere.” Third, it will require hypothesizing and testing the ecological mechanisms that allow subsistence of many species in low numbers.

Results provided strong evidence that GE maize performed better than its near isogenic line: grain yield was 5.6 to 24.5\% higher with lower concentrations of mycotoxins (−28.8\%), fumonisin (−30.6\%) and thricotecens (−36.5\%). The NTOs analyzed were not affected by GE maize, except for Braconidae, represented by a parasitoid of European corn borer, the target of Lepidoptera active Bt maize. Biogeochemical cycle parameters such as lignin content in stalks and leaves did not vary, whereas biomass decomposition was higher in GE maize. The results support the cultivation of GE maize, mainly due to enhanced grain quality and reduction of human exposure to mycotoxins. Furthermore, the reduction of the parasitoid of the target and the lack of consistent effects on other NTOs are confirmed.},

Where the thermocline is shallow and intersects the lighted euphotic zone, biological production is enhanced. In the eastern tropical Pacific thermocline depth is controlled by three interrelated processes: a basin-scale east/west thermocline tilt, a basin-scale thermocline shoaling at the gyre margins, and local wind-driven upwelling. These processes regulate supply of nutrient-rich subsurface waters to the euphotic zone, and on their basis we have divided the eastern tropical Pacific into seven main regions.

  abstract = {Oxygen deficient zones (ODZs) below the ocean surface regulate marine productivity by removing bioavailable nitrogen (N). A complex microbial community mediates N loss, but the interplay of its diverse metabolisms is poorly understood. We present an ecosystem model of the North Pacific ODZ that reproduces observed chemical distributions yet predicts different ODZ structure, rates, and climatic sensitivity compared to traditional geochemical models. An emergent lower O2 limit for aerobic nitrification lies below the upper O2 threshold for anaerobic denitrification, creating a zone of microbial coexistence that causes a larger ODZ but slower total rates of N loss. The O2-dependent competition for the intermediate nitrite produces gradients in its oxidation versus reduction, anammox versus heterotrophic denitrification, and the net ecological stoichiometry of N loss. The latter effect implies that an externally driven ODZ expansion should favor communities that more efficiently remove N, increasing the sensitivity of the N cycle to climate change.},

By comparing gene abundances estimated from the generated sequencing reads, functional differences between the communities can be identified. However, gene abundance data is affected by high levels of systematic variability, which can greatly reduce the statistical power and introduce false positives. Normalization, which is the process where systematic variability is identified and removed, is therefore a vital part of the data analysis. A wide range of normalization methods for high-dimensional count data has been proposed but their performance on the analysis of shotgun metagenomic data has not been evaluated.},

  abstract = {The dark ocean is one of the largest biomes on Earth, with critical roles in organic matter remineralization and global carbon sequestration. Despite its recognized importance, little is known about some key microbial players, such as the community of heterotrophic protists (HP), which are likely the main consumers of prokaryotic biomass. To investigate this microbial component at a global scale, we determined their abundance and biomass in deepwater column samples from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation using a combination of epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. HP were ubiquitously found at all depths investigated down to 4000 m. HP abundances decreased with depth, from an average of 72±19 cells ml−1 in mesopelagic waters down to 11±1 cells ml−1 in bathypelagic waters, whereas their total biomass decreased from 280±46 to 50±14 pg C ml−1. The parameters that better explained the variance of HP abundance were depth and prokaryote abundance, and to lesser extent oxygen concentration. The generally good correlation with prokaryotic abundance suggested active grazing of HP on prokaryotes. On a finer scale, the prokaryote:HP abundance ratio varied at a regional scale, and sites with the highest ratios exhibited a larger contribution of fungi molecular signal. Our study is a step forward towards determining the relationship between HP and their environment, unveiling their importance as players in the dark ocean’s microbial food web.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study creates a COVID-19 susceptibility scale at the county level, describes its components, and then assesses the health and socioeconomic resiliency of susceptible places across the rural-urban continuum. Methods Factor analysis grouped 11 indicators into 7 distinct susceptibility factors for 3,079 counties in the conterminous United States. Unconditional mean differences are assessed using a multivariate general linear model. Data from 2018 are primarily taken from the US Census Bureau and CDC. Results About 33\% of rural counties are highly susceptible to COVID-19, driven by older and health-compromised populations, and care facilities for the elderly. Major vulnerabilities in rural counties include fewer physicians, lack of mental health services, higher disability, and more uninsured. Poor Internet access limits telemedicine. Lack of social capital and social services may hinder local pandemic recovery. Meat processing facilities drive risk in micropolitan counties. Although metropolitan counties are less susceptible due to healthier and younger populations, about 6\% are at risk due to community spread from dense populations. Metropolitan vulnerabilities include minorities at higher health and diabetes risk, language barriers, being a transportation hub that helps spread infection, and acute housing distress. Conclusions There is an immediate need to know specific types of susceptibilities and vulnerabilities ahead of time to allow local and state health officials to plan and allocate resources accordingly. In rural areas it is essential to shelter-in-place vulnerable populations, whereas in large metropolitan areas general closure orders are needed to stop community spread. Pandemic response plans should address vulnerabilities.},

A renewed convergence between neurobiology and cognition is well underway. A promising area arises from the overlap between systems/cognitive neuroscience on the one side and the discipline of network science on the other. Neuroscience increasingly adopts network tools and concepts to describe the operation of collections of brain regions. Beyond just providing illustrative metaphors, network science offers a theoretical framework for approaching brain structure and function as a multi-scale system comprised of networks of neurons, circuits, nuclei, cortical areas and systems of areas. This paper views large-scale networks at the level of areas and systems, mostly based on data from human neuroimaging, and how this view of network structure and function has begun to illuminate our understanding of the biological basis of cognitive architectures.},

  abstract = {The alphaproteobacterial Roseobacter clade (Rhodobacterales) is one of the most important global players in carbon and sulfur cycles of marine ecosystems. The remarkable metabolic versatility of this bacterial lineage provides access to diverse habitats and correlates with a multitude of extrachromosomal elements. Four non-homologous replication systems and additional subsets of individual compatibility groups ensure the stable maintenance of up to a dozen replicons representing up to one third of the bacterial genome. This complexity presents the challenge of successful partitioning of all low copy number replicons. Based on the phenomenon of plasmid incompatibility, we developed molecular tools for target-oriented plasmid curing and could generate customized mutants lacking hundreds of genes. This approach allows one to analyze the relevance of specific replicons including so-called chromids that are known as lifestyle determinants of bacteria. Chromids are extrachromosomal elements with a chromosome-like genetic imprint (codon usage, GC content) that are essential for competitive survival in the natural habitat, whereas classical dispensable plasmids exhibit a deviating codon usage and typically contain type IV secretion systems for conjugation. The impact of horizontal plasmid transfer is exemplified by the scattered occurrence of the characteristic aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis among the Roseobacter clade and the recently reported transfer of the 45-kb photosynthesis gene cluster to extrachromosomal elements. Conjugative transmission may be the crucial driving force for rapid adaptations and hence the ecological prosperousness of this lineage of pink bacteria.},

  abstract = {Aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis providing additional ATP for a photoheterotrophic lifestyle is characteristic for several representatives of the marine Roseobacter clade. The patchy distribution of photosynthesis gene clusters (PGCs) within this lineage probably results from horizontal transfers and this explanation is supported by two cases of plasmid-located PGCs. In this study sequencing of the three Sulfitobacter guttiformis plasmids (pSG4, pSG53, pSG118) was initiated with the objective to analyse the 118 kb-sized photosynthetic replicon, but our annotation revealed several additional important traits including key genes of the primary metabolism. The comparison of the two photosynthesis plasmids from S. guttiformis and Roseobacter litoralis showed that their replication modules are located at precisely the same position within the 45 kb-sized PGC. However, comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the non-homologous replicases (RepB-III, DnaA-like I) and the two ParAB partitioning proteins unequivocally document an independent origin of their extrachromosomal replicons. The analogous positioning within the two photosynthesis super-operons can be explained by a two-step recombination scenario and seems to be the ultimate result of stabilizing selection. Our exemplary analyses of ‘pink’ plasmids document that chromosomal outsourcing is a common phenomenon in the Roseobacter clade and subsequent horizontal exchanges offer rapid access to the marine pan-genome.},

One or two layers affected by sewage could be distinguished in the water column: recently discharged ('ŉew”) sewage plume waters and `'old” plume waters. In conditions characterized by high Froude number the distribution of chlorophyll fluorescence in new plume waters was the same as for ambient waters, while for low Froude number, chlorophyll fluorescence increased within the plume, demonstrating the importance of physical forcing on effluent and phytoplankton interactions. New plume waters were associated with at least 2.7-fold increases in particle load, high concentrations of particles larger than 70 mu m, increases in ammonium, phosphate, and silicate, and high levels of heterotrophic bacteria and Prochlorococcus compared to surrounding waters. Both new and old plume layers, but not phytoplankton layers, showed distinct increases in fluorescence for the excitation/emission (Ex/Em) wavelength pair Ex/Em = 228/340 in mm, interpreted as particulate tryptophan-like fluorescence. Such fluorescence may be useful as a new in situ real-time indicator of waters affected by effluent discharges.},

The objective of the present study is to determine whether the hydrodynamic features are due to local forcings or seasonal ones. During both cruises, the Mediterranean Northern Current (NC) is clearly detected along the continental slope and intrudes on the eastern side of the shelf. East of the gulf, its flux is \textasciitilde 2 Sv both in June and January in opposition to previous literature results. Otherwise, the NC characteristics exhibit usual seasonal differences. During the summer, the NC is wider (35~km), shallower (\textasciitilde 200 m), and weaker (maximum currents of 40–50~cm s–1) than during the winter (respectively, 28~km, 250–300~m, 70~cm s–1). Moreover the NC is tilted vertically during the winter, following the more pronounced cyclonic dome structure of that season. Its meanders are interpreted as due to baroclinic instabilities propagating along the shelf break. Other circulation features are also season-specific. The summer stratification allows the development, after strong wind variations, of inertial currents with their characteristic two-layer baroclinic structure. In the top layer, the speed of the inertial oscillation can locally be as high as 200\% the NC speed. Otherwise in the surface layer, inertial current is about 2/3~the NC. During the 1999 winter, dense water formations are observed both on the continental shelf and offshore. Other hydrodynamic features depend primarily on topography or wind forcing. Deep portions of the NC go up canyons. The continental shelf circulation is complex, and influenced by the wind stress curl. During Moogli 3, strong eastern counter-currents may be linked to the numerous intrusions of the NC on the shelf. During Moogli 2, tramontane conditions seem to favor the formation of a cyclonic structure on the western continental shelf.},

Stool samples have been shown to be appropriate for diagnostic testing for SARS CoV, although it has been recognized to be a heterogeneous and difficult sample that contains amplification inhibitors. Limited information on the efficiency of extraction methods for the purification and concentration of SARS CoV RNA from stool samples is available. Our study objectives were to determine the optimal extraction method for SARS CoV RNA detection and to examine the effect of increased specimen volume for the detection of SARS CoV RNA in stool specimens. We conducted a multicenter evaluation of four automated and four manual extraction methods using dilutions of viral lysate in replicate mock stool samples, followed by quantitation of SARS CoV RNA using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. The sensitivities of the manual methods ranged from 50\% to 100\%, with the Cortex Biochem Magazorb method, a magnetic bead isolation method, allowing detection of all 12 positive samples. The sensitivities of the automated methods ranged from 75\% to 100\%. The bioMérieux NucliSens automated extractor and miniMag extraction methods each had a sensitivity of 100\%. Examination of the copy numbers detected and the generation of 10-fold dilutions of the extracted material indicated that a number of extraction methods retained inhibitory substances that prevented optimal amplification. Increasing the volume of sample input did improve detection. This information could be useful for the extraction of other RNA viruses from stool samples and demonstrates the need to evaluate extraction methods for different specimen types.},

  abstract = {The vertical flux of particles in the ocean drives the movement of organic carbon to the deep ocean. We have been studying the distribution and flux of these particles using the SOLOPC, a profiling Lagrangian (SOLO) float with a Laser Optical Particle Counter (LOPC). We have been able to distinguish between aggregate-like and zooplankton-like particles with diameters \&gt; 2 mm but needed a way to separate the smaller particles into aggregates and zooplankton. Observations included a lognormal-shaped fraction in the normalized volume distribution similar to that observed in results for simulations of particles in the euphotic zone. By fitting a lognormal distribution to the volume spectrum of particles with diameters ≤ 2 mm , we have been successful at making a separation of marine snow material from other, presumably living, particles. The particle volumes derived using the separations are positively correlated with fluorescence, particulate organic carbon, and the volume of larger particles classified as aggregate-like, which supports the conclusion that these particles are truly aggregates, in some cases derived from phytoplankton. The residual volumes (total less the above fit) are highly correlated with the volumes of large, zooplankton-like particles. Downward velocities of the aggregate fraction calculated from time series of particle profiles are consistent with previous estimates of particle settling rates ( 20 – 70 m d − 1 ) . We now have a tool to estimate aggregate distributions, properties, and vertical fluxes in the euphotic zone, including when and where they change.},

  abstract = {Septic-system discharges can be an important source of micropollutants (including pharmaceuticals and endocrine active compounds) to adjacent groundwater and surface water systems. Groundwater samples were collected from well networks tapping glacial till in New England (NE) and sandy surficial aquifer New York (NY) during one sampling round in 2011. The NE network assesses the effect of a single large septic system that receives discharge from an extended health care facility for the elderly. The NY network assesses the effect of many small septic systems used seasonally on a densely populated portion of Fire Island. The data collected from these two networks indicate that hydrogeologic and demographic factors affect micropollutant concentrations in these systems. The highest micropollutant concentrations from the NE network were present in samples collected from below the leach beds and in a well downgradient of the leach beds. Total concentrations for personal care/domestic use compounds, pharmaceutical compounds and plasticizer compounds generally ranged from 1 to over 20μg/L in the NE network samples. High tris(2-butoxyethyl phosphate) plasticizer concentrations in wells beneath and downgradient of the leach beds ({$>$}20μg/L) may reflect the presence of this compound in cleaning agents at the extended health-care facility. The highest micropollutant concentrations for the NY network were present in the shoreline wells and reflect groundwater that is most affected by septic system discharges. One of the shoreline wells had personal care/domestic use, pharmaceutical, and plasticizer concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 5.7μg/L. Estradiol equivalency quotient concentrations were also highest in a shoreline well sample (3.1ng/L). Most micropollutant concentrations increase with increasing specific conductance and total nitrogen concentrations for shoreline well samples. These findings suggest that septic systems serving institutional settings and densely populated areas in coastal settings may be locally important sources of micropollutants to adjacent aquifer and marine systems.},

Images are recorded at a frequency up to 6 Hz. If the UVP5 is interfaced with a CTD, these images are acquired and analyzed in real time. Images are recorded every 20 cm at the 1 m s−1 lowering speed. The current maximum deployment depth is 3000 m. The recorded volume per image is 1.02 L, and the conversion equation from pixel area to size in mm2 is Sm=0.003Sp1.3348 where Sp is the surface of the particle in pixels and Sm the surface in mm2. Comparisons between the earlier UVP versions and UVP5 indicate that images ranging in size from 105 µm to 2.66 mm are identical so historical and contemporary data sets can be compared.},

A broad scale characterization of the oyster microbiome over spatial and seasonal scales, however, has never been carried out. The primary goal of this study was to examine the factors mediating microbial communities of the gut and pallial fluid of C. virginica at three sites within the Long Island Sound estuary, with a focus on both genetic structure (T-RFLP) and physiological profiling (EcoPlates) of the microbiome. Results indicated that the genetic structure of microbial communities of oysters was minimally separated across sites, but was influenced by season. Although the microbial community structure was similar, the number of carbon sources utilized by these communities (richness) varied across site, season, and anatomical location within the host. Parameters including oyster condition index, Dermo disease, and ambient water temperature were measured to assess their influence on the oyster microbiome. Only water temperature was found to have a significant relationship with microbial community structure and richness. Results suggest that a core microbiome may exist within the eastern oyster, specifically for those populations that are not genetically distinct.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate effects on health of exposure to cyanobacteria as a result of recreational water activities. Participants, who were aged six years and over, were interviewed at water recreation sites in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria on selected Sundays during January and February 1995. Telephone follow–up was conducted two and seven days later to record any subsequent diarrhoea, vomiting, flu–like symptoms, skin rashes, mouth ulcers, fevers and eye or ear irritations. On the Sundays of interview, water samples from the sites were collected for cyanobac–terial cell counts and toxin analysis. There were 852 participants, of whom 75 did not have water contact on the day of interview and were considered unexposed. The 777 who had water contact were considered exposed. No significant differences in overall symptoms were found between the unexposed and exposed after two days. At seven days, there was a significant trend to increasing symptom occurrence with duration of exposure (P = 0.03). There was a significant trend to increasing symptom occurrence with increase in cell count (P = 0.04). Participants exposed to more than 5000 cells per mL for more than one hour had a significantly higher symptom occurrence rate than the unexposed. Symptoms were not correlated with the presence of hepatotoxins. These results suggest symptom occurrence was associated with duration of contact with water containing cyanobacteria, and with cyanobacterial cell density. The findings suggest that the current safety threshold for exposure of 20 000 cells per mL may be too high. (Aust N Z J Public Health 1997; 21: 562–6)},

  abstract = {Bacterioplankton growth is expected to depend on the availability of organic and inorganic nutrients. Still, no studies have investigated how the magnitude and type of nutrient limitation experienced by marine bacteria change on a temporal scale. We carried out a series of nutrient enrichment experiments to examine the variability in nutrient limitation of bacteria in the NW Mediterranean Sea, at monthly intervals, over an 18 mo period. Short-term enrichment bioassays (24 h incubation) showed that bacterial P limitation could occur throughout the year, but was most pronounced during spring and summer, coinciding with very low concentrations of dissolved inorganic phosphorus and chlorophyll a, and higher N:P ratios. During the non-stratified period in autumn and winter, bacteria were at times strongly C limited. Inorganic nitrogen limitation was not detected at any time. Long-term bioassays with and without enrichment, where growth was monitored until stationary phase using the seawater dilution culture approach, largely confirmed the results from the short-term bioassays. Analysis of the bacterial assemblages in these cultures, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, suggested that the growth of some central components of the native bacterioplankton assemblage (i.e. specific Roseobacter and Flavobacteria phylotypes) was restricted due to the limited availability of P in spring and summer. We conclude that seasonal variability in the type and severity of nutrient limitation can substantially contribute to the regulation of bacterioplankton growth and community composition, and thereby affect the turnover of dissolved organic matter and inorganic nutrients in the sea.},

Nevertheless, information on the distribution of specific bacterial taxa and how this is influenced by environmental factors in separate sea areas is sparse. Here we report on bacterial community structure across the Skagerrak-Kattegat front. The front separates North Sea water from water with a Baltic Sea origin. We documented community differences across the front using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA and whole-genome DNA hybridization towards community DNA. Analysis of the community `fingerprints' by DGGE revealed clustering of samples according to side of the front and depth. Consistent with these results, whole-genome DNA hybridization for 28 bacterial species isolated from the sampling region indicated that bacteria related to the Roseobacter clade and Bacteroidetes as well as prosthecate bacteria (e.g. Hyphomonas) showed distinct distribution patterns on each side of the front, and also with depth. Differences in bacterioplankton species composition across the frontal area were paralleled by differences in quantitative variables such as phytoplankton biomass (chl a), dissolved organic carbon, and bacterial production. Furthermore, we observed differences in more descriptive variables such as salinity range, bacterial growth-limiting nutrients and phytoplankton composition. We suggest that not only quantitative but also qualitative differences in variables that affect bacterial growth are required to cause divergence in bacterioplankton community composition between marine regions.},

  abstract = {We analyzed size-specific dry mass, sinking velocity, and apparent diffusivity in field-sampled marine snow, laboratory-made aggregates formed by diatoms or coccolithophorids, and small and large zooplankton fecal pellets with naturally varying content of ballast materials. Apparent diffusivity was measured directly inside aggregates and large (millimeter-long) fecal pellets using microsensors. Large fecal pellets, collected in the coastal upwelling off Cape Blanc, Mauritania, showed the highest volume-specific dry mass and sinking velocities because of a high content of opal, carbonate, and lithogenic material (mostly Saharan dust), which together comprised \textasciitilde 80\% of the dry mass. The average solid matter density within these large fecal pellets was 1.7 g cm-3, whereas their excess density was 0.25 ± 0.07 g cm-3. Volume-specific dry mass of all sources of aggregates and fecal pellets ranged from 3.8 to 960 µg mm-3, and average sinking velocities varied between 51 and 732 m d-1. Porosity was {$>$}0.43 and {$>$}0.96 within fecal pellets and phytoplankton-derived aggregates, respectively. Averaged values of apparent diffusivity of gases within large fecal pellets and aggregates were 0.74 and 0.95 times that of the free diffusion coefficient in sea water, respectively. Ballast increases sinking velocity and, thus, also potential O2 fluxes to sedimenting aggregates and fecal pellets. Hence, ballast minerals limit the residence time of aggregates in the water column by increasing sinking velocity, but apparent diffusivity and potential oxygen supply within aggregates are high, whereby a large fraction of labile organic carbon can be respired during sedimentation.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Photosynthesis and respiration were measured in 1 to 6 mm large aggregates (marine snow) collected in the Southern Californian Bight, USA. The aggregates were freely sinking in a vertical flow system with an upward flow velocity which opposed the sinking velocity of individual aggregates during the measurements. The aggregates were net heterotrophic communities at light intensities {$<$}152 ± 64 µE m-2 s-1, and respiration comprised 75 ± 21\% of gross photosynthesis at saturating light intensities {$>$}500 µE m-2 s-1. Bacterial densities on aggregates were {$>$}2000-fold higher than in the surrounding water. Cytophaga was highly abundant in the aggregate-associated bacterial community as identified by in situ hybridization techniques. Both the respiration rate per aggregate volume and the bacterial densities decreased with increasing aggregate size. The respiration rates normalized to the number of bacteria in single aggregates were 7.4 to 70 fmol C cell-1 d-1. The aggregate community respired 433 to 984 ng C d-1 per aggregate in darkness, which yielded a turnover time of 8 to 9 d for the total organic carbon in aggregates. Thus, marine snow is not only a vehicle for vertical flux of organic matter; the aggregates are also hotspots of microbial respiration which cause a fast and efficient respiratory turnover of particulate organic carbon in the sea.},

Controlling factors for aggregate remineralization rates and solute exchange with the surrounding water, however, are poorly quantified because of few empirical data. To study the role of flow and diffusion on aggregate remineralization rates, oxygen distributions were mapped within and around aggregates by use of microelectrodes in a flow field similar to that experienced by sinking aggregates. The oxygen distribution was asymmetrical with a wake of undersaturated water at the rear (downstream) of the aggregates. Oxygen concentrations within the aggregates were {$>$}80\% of air saturation. The diffusive fluxes of oxygen at the aggregate-water interface were similar along the equator and at the downstream pole for a wide range of different aggregate sources (field-sampled diatom aggregates, lab-made diatom aggregates, aggregates formed from freeze-thawed diatoms, and zooplankton detritus aggregates) measured at various temperatures. Remineralization rates were reaction limited and, hence, determined by substrate quality and quantity rather than by transport-limited oxygen supply during sedimentation at ambient oxygen concentrations above \textasciitilde 25 µM.},

In the presence of Fh, Tc was present primarily as a fine-grained Tc(IV)/Fe precipitate that was distinct from the Tc(IV)O2·nH2O solids produced by direct biological Tc(VII) reduction. Aqueous Tc concentrations ({$<$}0.2 ?m) in the bioreduced Fh suspensions (1.7 to 3.2 ? 10?9 mol L?1) were over 1 order of magnitude lower than when TcO4? was biologically reduced in the absence of Fh (4.0 ? 10?8 to 1.0 ? 10?7 mol L?1). EXAFS analyses of the bioreduced Fh-Tc products were consistent with variable chain length Tc?O octahedra bonded to Fe?O octahedra associated with the surface of the residual or secondary Fe(III) oxide. In contrast, biogenic TcO2·nH2O had significantly more Tc?Tc second neighbors and a distinct long-range order consistent with small particle polymers of TcO2. In Fe-rich subsurface sediments, the reduction of Tc(VII) by Fe(II) may predominate over direct microbial pathways, potentially leading to lower concentrations of aqueous 99Tc(IV).},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Active heterotrophic bacterial communities exist in all marine environments, and although their growth rates or respiratory rates may be limited by the interaction of low substrate concentrations with temperatures near their lower limit for growth, temperature and substrate concentrations are rarely considered together as limiting factors. Moreover, attempts to evaluate metabolic limits by both temperature and substrate concentration have sometimes led to confusing conclusions, because, while we can measure dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in natural waters, much of it is not readily available to heterotrophic bacteria. In spite of this procedural limitation, it can be helpful to regard temperature and substrate concentration as potential limiting factors that interact. In temperate ocean surface waters and estuarine waters, where bacterial growth is often reduced in winter, growth and respiration may be increased experimentally either by raising the temperature or by increasing organic substrate concentrations, providing indirect evidence that the limitation is an effect of temperature on substrate uptake or assimilation. Experimental work with bacterial isolates also has shown a temperature-substrate interaction. In permanently cold polar waters, most heterotrophic bacteria appear to be living at temperatures well below their optima for growth. Nevertheless, bacteria in permanently cold surface waters can achieve activity rates in summer that are as high as those in temperate waters. In sea ice, rates of bacterial production are most often low, even though concentrations of substrates, including free amino acids, are sometimes much higher than they are in seawater. This suggests that at sea ice temperatures heterotrophic bacteria have lowered ability to take up or utilize organic substrates.},

Pyrosequencing produced 75 558 putative mRNA reads from a day transcriptome and 75 946 from a night transcriptome. Taxonomic binning of annotated mRNAs indicated that Cyanobacteria contributed a greater percentage of the transcripts (54\% of annotated sequences) than expected based on abundance (35\% of cell counts and 21\% 16S rRNA of libraries), and may represent the most actively transcribing cells in this surface ocean community in both the day and night. Major heterotrophic taxa contributing to the community transcriptome included alpha-Proteobacteria (19\% of annotated sequences, most of which were SAR11-related) and gamma-Proteobacteria (4\%). The composition of transcript pools was consistent with models of prokaryotic gene expression, including operon-based transcription patterns and an abundance of genes predicted to be highly expressed. Metabolic activities that are shared by many microbial taxa (e.g. glycolysis, citric acid cycle, amino acid biosynthesis and transcription and translation machinery) were well represented among the community transcripts. There was an overabundance of transcripts for photosynthesis, C1 metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation in the day compared with night, and evidence that energy acquisition is coordinated with solar radiation levels for both autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes. In contrast, housekeeping activities such as amino acid biosynthesis, membrane synthesis and repair, and vitamin biosynthesis were overrepresented in the night transcriptome. Direct sequencing of these environmental transcripts has provided detailed information on metabolic and biogeochemical responses of a microbial community to solar forcing.},

  abstract = {This study explored the short-term planktonic microbial community structure and resilience in Lake Lanier (GA, USA) while simultaneously evaluating the technical aspects of identifying taxa via 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequence data. 16S rRNA gene amplicons generated from four temporally discrete samples were sequenced with 454 GS-FLX-Ti yielding ∼40,000 rRNA gene sequences from each sample and representing ∼300 observed OTUs. Replicates obtained from the same biological sample clustered together but several biases were observed, linked to either the PCR or sequencing-preparation steps. In comparisons with companion whole-community shotgun metagenome datasets, the estimated number of OTUs at each timepoint was concordant, but 1.5 times and ∼10 times as many phyla and genera, respectively, were identified in the metagenomes. Our analyses showed that the 16S rRNA gene captures broad shifts in community diversity over time, but with limited resolution and lower sensitivity compared to metagenomic data. We also identified OTUs that showed marked shifts in abundance over four close timepoints separated by perturbations and tracked these taxa in the metagenome vs. 16S rRNA amplicon data. A strong summer storm had less of an effect on community composition than did seasonal mixing, which revealed a distinct succession of organisms. This study provides insights into freshwater microbial communities and advances the approaches for assessing community diversity and dynamics in situ.},

  abstract = {CO2 currently accumulating in the atmosphere permeates into ocean surface layers, where it may impact on marine animals in addition to effects caused by global warming. At the same time, several countries are developing scenarios for the disposal of anthropogenic CO2 in the worlds' oceans, especially the deep sea. Elevated CO2 partial pressures (hypercapnia) will affect the physiology of water breathing animals, a phenomenon also considered in recent discussions of a role for CO2 in mass extinction events in earth history. Our current knowledge of CO2 effects ranges from effects of hypercapnia on acid-base regulation, calcification and growth to influences on respiration, energy turnover and mode of metabolism. The present paper attempts to evaluate critical processes and the thresholds beyond which these effects may become detrimental. CO2 elicits acidosis not only in the water, but also in tissues and body fluids. Despite compensatory accumulation of bicarbonate, acid-base parameters (pH, bicarbonate and CO2 levels) and ion levels reach new steady-state values, with specific, long-term effects on metabolic functions. Even though such processes may not be detrimental, they are expected to affect long-term growth and reproduction and may thus be harmful at population and species levels. Sensitivity is maximal in ommastrephid squid, which are characterized by a high metabolic rate and extremely pH-sensitive blood oxygen transport. Acute sensitivity is interpreted to be less in fish with intracellular blood pigments and higher capacities to compensate for CO2 induced acid-base disturbances than invertebrates. Virtually nothing is known about the degree to which deep-sea fishes are affected by short or long term hypercapnia. Sensitivity to CO2 is hypothesized to be related to the organizational level of an animal, its energy requirements and mode of life. Long-term effects expected at population and species levels are in line with recent considerations of a detrimental role of CO2 during mass extinctions in the earth's history. Future research is needed in this area to evaluate critical effects of the various CO2 disposal scenarios.},

Microcystin is known to accumulate in fish and other aquatic biota, however the prevalence of microcystin in fish tissue and the human health risks posed by microcystin exposure through fish consumption remain poorly resolved. Here we show that microcystin is pervasive in water and fish from several tropical (Ugandan) and temperate (North American) lakes, including lakes that support some of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We establish that fish consumption can be an important and sometimes dominant route of microcystin exposure for humans, and can cause consumers to exceed recommended total daily intake guidelines for microcystin. These results highlight the importance of monitoring microcystin concentrations in fish, and the need to consider potential exposure to microcystin through fish consumption in order to adequately assess human exposure risk.},

This interdisciplinary field has progressed considerably over the recent past, due in large part to advances in technology that have improved our ability to observe plankton and their fluid environment simultaneously across multiple scales. Recent research has demonstrated that fluid flow interacting with plankton behavior can drive many planktonic processes and spatial patterns. Moreover, evidence now suggests that plankton behavior can significantly affect ocean physics. Biophysical processes relevant to plankton ecology span a range of scales; for example, microscale turbulence influences planktonic growth and grazing at millimeter scales, whereas features such as fronts and eddies can shape larger-scale plankton distributions. Most research in this field focuses on specific processes and thus is limited to a narrow range of spatial scales. However, biophysical interactions are intimately connected across scales, since processes at a given scale can have implications at much larger and smaller scales; thus, a cross-scale perspective on how biological and physical dynamics interact is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the field. Here, we present a review of biophysical interactions in the plankton across multiple scales, emphasizing new findings over recent decades and highlighting opportunities for cross-scale comparisons. By investigating feedbacks and interactions between processes at different scales, we aim to build cross-scale intuition about biophysical planktonic processes and provide insights for future directions in the field.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Marine snow is central to the marine carbon cycle, and quantifying its small-scale settling dynamics in different physical environments is essential to understanding its role in biogeochemical cycles. Previous field observations of marine aggregate thin layers associated with sharp density gradients have led to the hypothesis that these layers may be caused by a decrease in aggregate settling speed at density interfaces. Here, we present experimental data on aggregate settling behavior, showing that these particles can dramatically decrease their settling velocity when passing through sharp density transitions. This delayed settling can be caused by 2 potential mechanisms: (1) entrainment of lighter fluid from above as the particle passes through the density gradient, and (2) retention at the transition driven by changes in the density of the particle due to its porosity. The aggregates observed in this study exhibited 2 distinct settling behaviors when passing through the density transition. Quantitatively comparing these different behaviors with predictions from 2 models allow us to infer that the delayed settling of the first group of aggregates was primarily driven by diffusion-limited retention, whereas entrainment of lighter fluid was the dominant mechanism for the second group. Coupled with theory, our experimental results demonstrate that both entrainment and diffusion-limited retention can play an important role in determining particle settling dynamics through density transitions. This study thus provides insight into ways that delayed settling can lead to the formation of aggregate thin layers, important biological hotspots that affect trophic dynamics, and biogeochemical cycling in the ocean.},

Extensive literature exists on the most frequently encountered cyanotoxin, microcystin, in freshwater environments. Yet, the expansion of microcystin producing CyanoHABs and the transport of contaminated inland waters to estuarine and coastal marine waters has only recently received attention. This paper synthesizes information on the salinity tolerance of microcystin producing cyanobacteria and summarizes available case reports on microcystin presence in estuarine and coastal waters. We highlight a potential food-borne exposure route to humans by reviewing the growing body of evidence that shows microcystins can accumulate in coastal seafood. These cases reinforce the importance of freshwater nutrient reduction and the need for freshwater management efforts to look beyond lacustrine and riverine systems. Events reviewed here likely only represent a small proportion of cases where microcystins affect estuarine and coastal waters. We strongly suggest increased monitoring and research efforts to understand, react to, and prevent ecological and health problems associated with the growing problem of toxic CyanoHABs in coastal environments.},

While such blooms in lakes tend to be viewed as a localized phenomenon, there is significant potential for downstream export of toxins to freshwater streams, and marine and brackish water environments. However, monitoring for cyanotoxins typically associated with freshwaters, such as the hepatotoxin, microcystin (MC) in marine receiving waters is rare. In 2013 we studied four eutrophic Puget Sound area lakes to assess both toxin transport to marine waters and its potential accumulation in marine shellfish, specifically mussels. Shellfish beds are extensive throughout Puget Sound, and recreational harvest occurs downstream of our study lakes, so a study goal was to also assess if shellfish consumption poses a human health risk for MC exposure. We confirm, for the first time, freshwater to marine transfer of MCs in Puget Sound with subsequent bioaccumulation of MC by mussels. ELISA analysis estimated maximum MC concentrations in source lakes of 2700 μg/L, up to 0.34 μg/L in marine waters and 6.5 μg/kg in mussels. Confirmatory analyses by LC-MS/MS on water and mussel samples identified MC-LA as the major toxin. Although we found relatively low MC levels in mussels, our study implies that potential concern for human food safety is justified and warrants further investigation.},

  abstract = {The sequestration of carbon in the deep ocean relies on the export of sinking particulate organic matter (POM) originating in the surface waters and its attenuation by organisms that reprocess and repackage it. Despite decades of research, predicting the variability of POM to the deep ocean remains difficult as there is still a gap in the knowledge as to which and how organisms control or influence POM export. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes to investigate the community in sinking particulates collected over 9-months (November 2016–July 2017) at Station M, located within the California Current ecosystem. Particle-associated communities were collected in sediment traps (3900~m and 3950~m), in aggregates that settled on the sea floor (4000~m), and in seawater from the overlying water column. For a majority of the deployment, particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes were within the Station M long-term time series mean~±~σ (8.3~±~7.9~mg~C m−2 d−1). In late June, a high flux event ({$>$}long-term POC mean+2σ) was captured, accounting for 44\% of the POC collected during the study. The rRNA genes within the sinking particles indicated highly variable eukaryal communities over time, including the export of oligotrophic autotrophs likely by various metazoan taxa during winter, the sporadic and dominant presence of diverse radiolarian orders, and the important role of coastal diatoms during seasonal increases in POC flux. Specifically, the onset of the high POC flux event in June was attributed to the export of a single coastal diatom species. A coincident increase in the relative abundance of metazoan sequences suggests that zooplankton grazing on the diatom community played a role in rapid transport of large quantities of POC to the deep sea. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene community supported the presence of highly processed POM during winter due to the high relative abundance of deep sea Gammaproteobacteria, that transitioned to fresher, more labile POM with the arrival of a diatom bloom community. These observations support long standing paradigms of particulate export to the deep sea, including its origin and mechanisms of export mediated by a diverse community of organisms, and implicate rapidly exported diatom blooms as at least one source of the increasingly frequent episodic flux events that account for most POC sequestered in the deep ocean at Station M.},

  abstract = {Our work was motivated by discoveries of prokaryotic communities that survive with little nutrient in ice and permafrost, with implications for past or present microbial life in Martian permafrost and Europan ice. We compared the temperature dependence of metabolic rates of microbial communities in permafrost, ice, snow, clouds, oceans, lakes, marine and freshwater sediments, and subsurface aquifer sediments. Metabolic rates per cell fall into three groupings: (i) a rate, μg(T), for growth, measured in the laboratory at in situ temperatures with minimal disturbance of the medium; (ii) a rate, μm(T), sufficient for maintenance of functions but for a nutrient level too low for growth; and (iii) a rate, μs(T), for survival of communities imprisoned in deep glacial ice, subsurface sediment, or ocean sediment, in which they can repair macromolecular damage but are probably largely dormant. The three groups have metabolic rates consistent with a single activation energy of ≈110 kJ and that scale as μg(T):μm(T):μs(T) ≈ 106:103:1. There is no evidence of a minimum temperature for metabolism. The rate at -40°C in ice corresponds to ≈10 turnovers of cellular carbon per billion years. Microbes in ice and permafrost have metabolic rates similar to those in water, soil, and sediment at the same temperature. This finding supports the view that, far below the freezing point, liquid water inside ice and permafrost is available for metabolism. The rate μs(T) for repairing molecular damage by means of DNA-repair enzymes and protein-repair enzymes such as methyltransferase is found to be comparable to the rate of spontaneous molecular damage.},

A few previous studies have separately suggested that such intermittency enhances phytoplankton growth and trophic transfer to sustain zooplankton and ultimately fisheries. Recent observations have revealed that phytoplankton distributions display consistently high degrees of mm scale patchiness, increasing along a gradient from estuarine to open ocean waters. Using a generalized framework of plankton ecosystem models with different trophic configurations, each accounting for this intermittency, we show that it consistently enhances trophic transfer efficiency (TE), i.e. the transfer of energy up the food chain, and expands the model stability domain. Our results provide a new explanation for observation-based estimates of unexpectedly high TE in the vast oligotrophic ocean and suggest that by enhancing the viable trait space, micro-scale variability may potentially sustain plankton biodiversity.},

Electron microscopy counts of virus-like particles in the high molecular weight concentrate (HMWC) correlated closely to epifluorescence microscopy counts of {$<$}0.22 mum DAPI-positive, DNase-resistant particles of the HMWC. Acridine orange direct counts of bacterial abundances significantly declined (often to⅟2 or less of controls) when seawater was incubated with 4- to 16-fold enrichments of HMWC. Microwave treatment of the HMWC before addition to seawater virtually eliminated the declines in bacterial abundance. The combined evidence of the size range of particles, the heat lability of the HMWC and the presence of {$<$}0.22 mum DAPI-fluorescent, DNase-resistant particles by epifluorescence microscopy and abundant virus particles by electron microscopy suggests that a dominant bacterial mortality agent in the seawater concentrate was bacteriophage, although we could not rule out an effect of high molecular weight proteins.},

Sediment trap material from 30 to 400 m collected from the north Pacific Ocean during the 'VERTEX' cruises in 1980 to 1982 was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Viruses were present in all of the sinking particles examined except for those from one sample, of highly degraded algal cells or small fecal pellets, from 400 m. Viruses in the sinking particles often appeared aggregated. From 0.7 to 3.7 \% of the bacteria in sinking particles contained mature phage; from these data and limited information from pure cultures, we estimate that 2 to 37 \% of the particulate-associated bacteria may be killed by viral lysis. Many eukaryotic cells were also apparently infected with viruses, but none (≤ 50 cells observed) of the cyanobacteria or 'Chlorella-like' cells appeared infected. Viral lysis of bacteria associated with sinking particles and free-living bacteria may be causally linked and may play a role in dissolved organic carbon production and the dynamics of sinking particles. Viral lysis may have major implications for understanding cycling of material and energy in the ocean.},

  abstract = {High diversity in natural communities is indicated by both traditional, cultivation-based methods and molecular techniques, but the latter have significantly increased richness estimates. The increased ease and reduced cost associated with molecular analysis of microbial communities have fuelled interest in the links between richness, community composition and ecosystem function, and raise questions about our ability to understand mechanisms controlling interactions in highly complex communities. High-throughput sequencing is increasing the depth of sequencing but the relevance of such studies to important ecological questions is often unclear. This article discusses, and challenges, some of the often implicit assumptions made in community studies. It suggests greater focus on ecological questions, more critical analysis of accepted concepts and consideration of the fundamental mechanisms controlling microbial processes and interactions in situ. These considerations indicate that many questions do not require deeper sequence analysis and increased phylogenetic resolution but, rather, require analysis at smaller spatial scale, determination of phenotypic diversity and temporal, rather than snapshot, studies. Increasing realisation of the high richness of microbial communities, and potentially high physiological diversity, also require new conceptual approaches.},

The ARB software suite with its corresponding rRNA datasets has been accepted by researchers worldwide as a standard tool for large scale rRNA analysis. However, the rapid increase of publicly available rRNA sequence data has recently hampered the maintenance of comprehensive and curated rRNA knowledge databases. A new system, SILVA (from Latin silva , forest), was implemented to provide a central comprehensive web resource for up to date, quality controlled databases of aligned rRNA sequences from the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya domains. All sequences are checked for anomalies, carry a rich set of sequence associated contextual information, have multiple taxonomic classifications, and the latest validly described nomenclature. Furthermore, two precompiled sequence datasets compatible with ARB are offered for download on the SILVA website: (i) the reference (Ref) datasets, comprising only high quality, nearly full length sequences suitable for in-depth phylogenetic analysis and probe design and (ii) the comprehensive Parc datasets with all publicly available rRNA sequences longer than 300 nucleotides suitable for biodiversity analyses. The latest publicly available database release 91 (August 2007) hosts 547 521 sequences split into 461 823 small subunit and 85 689 large subunit rRNAs.},

Differences in the coding of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase enzyme complex responsible for microcystin production have resulted in more than 100 microcystin variants being reported to date. The microcystin diversity of Microcystis CAWBG11 was investigated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. This revealed that CAWBG11 simultaneously produced 21 known microcystins and six new congeners: [Asp3] MC-RA, [Asp3] MC-RAba, [Asp3] MC-FA, [Asp3] MC-WA, MC-FAba and MC-FL. The new congeners were putatively characterized by tandem mass spectrometry and chemical derivatization. A survey of the microcystin congeners produced by 49 cyanobacterial strains documented in scientific literature showed that cyanobacteria generally produce four microcystin congeners, but strains which produce up to 47 microcystin congeners have been reported. Microcystis CAWBG11 (which produces at least 27 congeners) was positioned in the top ten percentile of the strains surveyed, and showed fluidity of the amino acids incorporated into both position two and position four.},

  abstract = {The mesohaline region of Chesapeake Bay had high densities of the scyphomedusan Chrysaora quinquecirrha and low densities of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi in 1987-1990 and 1995. By contrast, 1996-2000 had much lower medusa and higher ctenophore densities. Predation on copepods (Acartia tonsa) was intense in 1996-2000, and copepod densities were low when ctenophores were abundant. At equivalent sizes, the feeding potentials of ctenophores were greater than those of medusae, with clearance rates about 1.2 times greater by volume and about 3 times greater by carbon biomass. M. leidyi ctenophores more negatively influence copepod populations than C. quinquecirrha medusae because they are more effective predators of copepods and have broader spatial and temporal occurrence, wider salinity and temperature ranges, greater densities, and a more flexible life history. Because they consume ctenophores, C. quinquecirrha medusae positively affect copepod abundance. C. quinquecirrha and M. leidyi could be considered keystone predators because of their far-reaching effects on the plankton food web. The balance between medusae and ctenophores in Chesapeake Bay was greatly affected by climatic factors. Medusa abundances were high when dry years prevailed prior to and during 1987-1990 and 1995. By contrast, medusa abundances were low when dry and wet years alternated before and during 1996-2000. Significant variables that favored medusae in 1987-1990 and 1995 were high salinity, warm temperature, and high solar irradiance. The North Atlantic Oscillation Index was significantly inversely correlated with medusa numbers from 1960-1995. Climate clearly affects gelatinous predator abundances, with consequences that cascade throughout the plankton food web.},

  abstract = {Sinking particles are mainly composed of phytoplankton cells and zooplankton fecal pellets, but the proportions of these sources contribute to the overall particulate organic carbon (POC) flux are highly variable temporally and spatially. Here, we report for the first time simultaneous estimates of the POC fluxes from phytoplankton cells and zooplankton fecal pellets during a spring bloom in the East China Sea. The sinking rate of phytoplankton during the bloom event was 12 ± 2 m d–1, which was more than 10 times the rate at non-bloom stations (1.0 ± 0.8 m d–1). Microscopic observations indicated that the formation of aggregates by the Prorocentrum donghaiense (the dominant phytoplankton species) enhanced the sinking rates during the bloom. These enhanced sinking rates and 10 times higher phytoplankton biomass during the bloom increased POC fluxes to as high as 24 g C m–2 d–1, about 100 times the rate at reference non-bloom stations (0.26 g C m–2 d–1). The POC flux of fecal pellets at bloom stations (0.95–1.4 g C m–2 d–1) increased to only about 6 times the rates at non-bloom stations (0.20–0.25 g C m–2 d–1). The fecal pellet POC flux was mainly enhanced by the increase of phytoplankton abundance, which led to higher mesozooplankton grazing rates and fecal pellet production rates during the bloom. In summary, the majority of the enhanced sinking POC flux during the bloom was directly associated with phytoplankton sinking. This enhanced flux sequestered carbon faster than anticipated because of the enhancements of both phytoplankton sinking rates and abundance. Such dramatic, albeit brief, events make very important potential contributions to the annual POC flux.},

  abstract = {The likelihood that the carbon fluxes measured as part of the US-JGOFS field program in the equatorial Pacific ocean (EgPac) during 1992 yielded a balanced carbon budget for the surface ocean was determined. The major carbon fluxes incorporated into a surface carbon budget were: new production, particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export, CaC03 export, C02 gas evasion, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) supply, and the time rate of charge. The ratio of the measured concentration gradients of DOC and DIC provided a constraint on the ratio of POC/DOC export. Uncertainties of ±30–50\% for individual carbon flux measurements reduce the likelihood that a carbon balance can be measured during a JGOFS process-type study. As a benchmark, carbon fluxes were prescribed to yield a hypothetical surface carbon budget that was, on average, balanced. Given the typical errors in the individual carbon fluxes, however, there was only about a 30\% chance that this hypothetical budget could be measured to be balanced to ±50\%. Using this benchmark, it was determined that there was a ∼ 95 \% chance that the carbon flux measurements yielded a surface DIC budget balanced (to ±50\%) during El Nino conditions in boreal spring 1992, when the total organic carbon export rate was - 5 mmol C m-2 day- 1 and the POC export was ∼ 3 mmol C m−2 day−1. In boreal fall 1992, during cold period conditions, there was a ∼70\% chance that the surface carbon DIC budget was balanced when the total organic carbon export rate was ∼ 20 mmol C m−2 day−1 and export was -13 mmol C m-2 day-'. The DOC to DIC concentration gradient ratio of - -0.15, measured in depth profiles down to 100m and in surface waters, was used as an important constraint that most (\&gt; 70\%) of the organic carbon exported from the euphotic zone was POC rather than DOC. If a balanced surface DIC budget was used to test the compatibility of individual carbon fluxes measured during EgPac, then a three- to four-fold increase in total and particulate organic carbon export between spring and fall is indicated. This increase was not reflected in the POC loss rates measured by drifting sediment trap collections or estimated by234Th deficiencies coupled with the C/Th measured on suspended particles.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem processes are important determinants of the biogeochemistry of the ocean, and they can be profoundly affected by changes in climate. Ocean models currently express ecosystem processes through empirically derived parameterizations that tightly link key geochemical tracers to ocean physics. The explicit inclusion of ecosystem processes in models will permit ecological changes to be taken into account, and will allow us to address several important questions, including the causes of observed glacial–interglacial changes in atmospheric trace gases and aerosols, and how the oceanic uptake of CO2 is likely to change in the future. There is an urgent need to assess our mechanistic understanding of the environmental factors that exert control over marine ecosystems, and to represent their natural complexity based on theoretical understanding. We present a prototype design for a Dynamic Green Ocean Model (DGOM) based on the identification of (a) key plankton functional types that need to be simulated explicitly to capture important biogeochemical processes in the ocean; (b) key processes controlling the growth and mortality of these functional types and hence their interactions; and (c) sources of information necessary to parameterize each of these processes within a modeling framework. We also develop a strategy for model evaluation, based on simulation of both past and present mean state and variability, and identify potential sources of validation data for each. Finally, we present a DGOM-based strategy for addressing key questions in ocean biogeochemistry. This paper thus presents ongoing work in ocean biogeochemical modeling, which, it is hoped will motivate international collaborations to improve our understanding of the role of the ocean in the climate system.},

However, microbes are frequently difficult to culture in the laboratory, which can confound cataloging of members and understanding of how communities function. High-throughput sequencing technologies and a suite of computational pipelines have been combined into shotgun metagenomics methods that have transformed microbiology.

  abstract = {The SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a newly emerged, highly pathogenic agent that caused over 8,000 human infections with nearly 800 deaths between November 2002 and September 2003. While direct person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets accounted for most cases, other modes have not been ruled out. Faecal shedding is common and prolonged and has caused an outbreak in Hong Kong. We studied the stability of SARS-CoV under different conditions, both in suspension and dried on surfaces, in comparison with other human-pathogenic viruses, including human coronavirus HCoV-229E. In suspension, HCoV-229E gradually lost its infectivity completely while SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for up to 9 days; in the dried state, survival times were 24~h versus 6 days. Thermal inactivation at 56°C was highly effective in the absence of protein, reducing the virus titre to below detectability; however, the addition of 20\% protein exerted a protective effect resulting in residual infectivity. If protein-containing solutions are to be inactivated, heat treatment at 60°C for at least 30~min must be used. Different fixation procedures, e.g. for the preparation of immunofluorescence slides, as well as chemical means of virus inactivation commonly used in hospital and laboratory settings were generally found to be effective. Our investigations confirm that it is possible to care for SARS patients and to conduct laboratory scientific studies on SARS-CoV safely. Nevertheless, the agent’s tenacity is considerably higher than that of HCoV-229E, and should SARS re-emerge, increased efforts need to be devoted to questions of environmental hygiene.},

  abstract = {The diel vertical migration (DVM) of Calanus (Calanus finmarchicus, Calanus glacialis and Calanus hyperboreus) and Metridia longa was investigated in August 2008 at six locations to the north and northwest of Svalbard (Rijpfjorden, Ice, Marginal Ice Zone, Shelf break, Shelf and Kongsfjorden). Despite midnight sun conditions, a diel light cycle was clearly observed at all stations. We collected data on zooplankton vertical distribution using a Multi Plankton Sampler (200-μm mesh size) and an EK60 echosounder system (38, 120 and 200 kHz). These were supplemented by environmental data collected using a standard conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) profiler. The sea ice had recently opened in Rijpfjorden, Ice and Shelf stations, and these stations exhibited phytoplankton bloom conditions with pronounced fluorescence maxima at approximately 30~m. In contrast, Kongsfjorden was more representative of autumn conditions, with the Arctic bloom having culminated 2–3~months prior to sampling. All three Calanus species were found shallower than 50~m on average at Rijpfjorden and the Ice station, while C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus were found deeper than 200~m on average at Kongsfjorden. Shallow water DVM behaviour ({$<$}50~m) was observed at Rijpfjorden and the Shelf station, especially among the C. finmarchicus CI-CIII population, which was particularly abundant at the Shelf ({$>$}5,000 individuals/m3). A bimodal depth distribution was observed among C. finmarchicus at the Shelf break station, with CI-CIII copepodites dominating at depths shallower than 100~m and CIV-adult stages dominating at depths exceeding 600~m. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences between the day and night 200-kHz data, particularly at specified depth strata (25–50~m) where backscatter intensity was higher during the day, especially in Rijpfjorden and at the Ice station. We conclude that DVM signals exist in the Arctic during late summer/autumn, when a need to feed and an abundant food source exists, and these signals are primarily due to mesozooplankton.},

Because, N2-fixation accounts for up to 50\% of new production in this region we tested whether higher N2-fixation rates are linked to a greater nifH diversity. The nifH diversity was dominated by heterotrophic Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. We did not find any mechanistic links between nifH amplicon data, bacterial richness, and primary productivity due to the overall low nifH evenness in this region.},

A number of explanations have been offered to explain this including road design, emergency medical service proximity, and human factors. This research explored the potential contribution of rural driver attitudes that may underlie the increased fatal crash risk in rural environments. This analysis examined differences between rural and urban drivers in terms of self-reported risk taking for driving behaviors associated with fatal crashes and attitudes toward safety interventions using a large-scale survey. The results suggested that rural drivers engage in riskier behavior, such as not wearing seatbelts, because they have lower perceptions of the risks associated with such behaviors. Results also suggested that vehicle type (e.g., pickup trucks versus passenger vehicles) may be related to seatbelt compliance and frequency of driving under the influence of alcohol. Rural drivers perceived the utility of government-sponsored traffic safety interventions to be lower than their urban counterparts. This study provides insights into the role of the human factor in rural fatal crashes and provides policy suggestions for developing safety interventions that are designed with respect to the psychosocial factors that define the rural culture.},

Deposition of these bio-contaminated sediments affects the bed ecosystem. When re-suspended, they further affect water quality and health of both human as well as aquatic life. In this study, laboratory experiments are conducted in an annular flume to understand the interaction between suspended sediments attached with microbes (biosediment) and without microbes (non-biosediment) at different mix ratios (Mr = 0:1, 0.25:0.75, 0.50:0.50, and 1:0) and water salinity (S = 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 35 g/L). Results show that, rate of deposition increases with an increase in biosediment concentration for any water salinity and mix ratio. In saline water, presence of microbes on suspended sediments induces more deposition until water salinity of 5 g/L and thereafter deposition reduces. Presence of 25\% and 50\% of biosediment in water increases deposition up to a critical salinity of 1.72 g/L and 2.60 g/L, respectively. Suspended sediment particle size increases with an increase in biosediment concentration and decreases with an increase in water salinity. Fractal dimension results show that, when salinity increases, fragile non-biosediment and dense biosediments are retained in suspension. This study shows that presence of live microbes on suspended sediments affects their depositional behaviour.},

  abstract = {The deep sea, the largest biome on Earth, has a series of characteristics that make this environment both distinct from other marine and land ecosystems and unique for the entire planet. This review describes these patterns and processes, from geological settings to biological processes, biodiversity and biogeographical patterns. It concludes with a brief discussion of current threats from anthropogenic activities to deep-sea habitats and their fauna.  Investigations of deep-sea habitats and their fauna began in the late 19th century. In the intervening years, technological developments and stimulating discoveries have promoted deep-sea research and changed our way of understanding life on the planet. Nevertheless, the deep sea is still mostly unknown and current discovery rates of both habitats and species remain high. The geological, physical and geochemical settings of the deep-sea floor and the water column form a series of different habitats with unique characteristics that support specific faunal communities. Since 1840, 28 new habitats/ecosystems have been discovered from the shelf break to the deep trenches and discoveries of new habitats are still happening in the early 21st century. However, for most of these habitats the global area covered is unknown or has been only very roughly estimated; an even smaller – indeed, minimal – proportion has actually been sampled and investigated. We currently perceive most of the deep-sea ecosystems as heterotrophic, depending ultimately on the flux on organic matter produced in the overlying surface ocean through photosynthesis. The resulting strong food limitation thus shapes deep-sea biota and communities, with exceptions only in reducing ecosystems such as inter alia hydrothermal vents or cold seeps. Here, chemoautolithotrophic bacteria play the role of primary producers fuelled by chemical energy sources rather than sunlight. Other ecosystems, such as seamounts, canyons or cold-water corals have an increased productivity through specific physical processes, such as topographic modification of currents and enhanced transport of particles and detrital matter. Because of its unique abiotic attributes, the deep sea hosts a specialized fauna. Although there are no phyla unique to deep waters, at lower taxonomic levels the composition of the fauna is distinct from that found in the upper ocean. Amongst other characteristic patterns, deep-sea species may exhibit either gigantism or dwarfism, related to the decrease in food availability with depth. Food limitation on the seafloor and water column is also reflected in the trophic structure of heterotrophic deep-sea communities, which are adapted to low energy availability. In most of these heterotrophic habitats, the dominant megafauna is composed of detritivores, while filter feeders are abundant in habitats with hard substrata (e.g. mid-ocean ridges, seamounts, canyon walls and coral reefs). Chemoautotrophy through symbiotic relationships is dominant in reducing habitats.  Deep-sea biodiversity is among of the highest on the planet, mainly composed of macro and meiofauna, with high evenness. This is true for most of the continental margins and abyssal plains with hot spots of diversity such as seamounts or cold-water corals. However, in some ecosystems with particularly "extreme" physicochemical processes (e.g. hydrothermal vents), biodiversity is low but abundance and biomass are high and the communities are dominated by a few species. Two large-scale diversity patterns have been discussed for deep-sea benthic communities. First, a unimodal relationship between diversity and depth is observed, with a peak at intermediate depths (2000–3000 m), although this is not universal and particular abiotic processes can modify the trend. Secondly, a poleward trend of decreasing diversity has been discussed, but this remains controversial and studies with larger and more robust data sets are needed. Because of the paucity in our knowledge of habitat coverage and species composition, biogeographic studies are mostly based on regional data or on specific taxonomic groups. Recently, global biogeographic provinces for the pelagic and benthic deep ocean have been described, using environmental and, where data were available, taxonomic information. This classification described 30 pelagic provinces and 38 benthic provinces divided into 4 depth ranges, as well as 10 hydrothermal vent provinces. One of the major issues faced by deep-sea biodiversity and biogeographical studies is related to the high number of species new to science that are collected regularly, together with the slow description rates for these new species. Taxonomic coordination at the global scale is particularly difficult, but is essential if we are to analyse large diversity and biogeographic trends.  Because of their remoteness, anthropogenic impacts on deep-sea ecosystems have not been addressed very thoroughly until recently. The depletion of biological and mineral resources on land and in shallow waters, coupled with technological developments, are promoting the increased interest in services provided by deep-water resources. Although often largely unknown, evidence for the effects of human activities in deep-water ecosystems – such as deep-sea mining, hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, fishing, dumping and littering – is already accumulating. Because of our limited knowledge of deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and because of the specific life-history adaptations of many deep-sea species (e.g. slow growth and delayed maturity), it is essential that the scientific community works closely with industry, conservation organisations and policy makers to develop robust and efficient conservation and management options.},

  abstract = {During the SESAME EU FP6 project, all available particulate organic carbon (POC) data collected from drifting sediment trap and Underwater Vision Profiler deployments (INSU PROOF database, 1991–2011) were gathered in order to assess carbon export at the scale of the Mediterranean Sea. In this study, we observed that particle size, POC export, and the contribution of microphytoplankton to the phytoplankton community structure, all decreased following the west to east net primary production gradient. One the other hand, no clear longitudinal gradient was found regarding particle composition (C/N ratio or lipid content). The above longitudinal patterns were also observed at the seasonal scale from spring to summer in the northwestern sub-basin. These observations suggest that particle size rather than organic matter composition controls fluxes of POC in the Mediterranean Sea. The comparison between POC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes highlights the different time-scale of physicals vertical mechanisms and suggests that DOC flux can play an underestimated role in the supply of fresh carbon to the deep waters Mediterranean Sea. Indeed, DOC supply to deeper layers can be one order of magnitude larger than particle carbon flux but occurs in pulses when stratification breaks due to (i) deep-water formation, or (ii) winter mixing. In contrast, the vertical export of POC occurs throughout the year bringing weak, but almost continuous, energy to meso- and bathypelagic organisms.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have greatly increased our knowledge of microbial ecology of the indoor environments in which we live and work. However, the number of studies collecting robust, long-term data using standardized methods to characterize important building characteristics, indoor environmental conditions, or human occupancy – collectively referred to as “built environment data” – remain limited. Insufficiently described built environment data can limit our ability to compare microbial ecology results from one indoor environment to another or to use the results to assess how best to control indoor microbial communities. This work first reviews recent literature on microbial community characterization in indoor environments (primarily those that utilized molecular methods), paying particular attention to the level of assessment of influential built environment characteristics and the specific methods and procedures that were used to collect those data. Based on those observations, we then describe a large suite of indoor environmental and building design and operational parameters that can be measured using standardized methods to inform experimental design in future studies of the microbial ecology of the built environment. This work builds upon the recently developed MIxS-BE package that identifies high-level minimal built environment metadata to collect in microbial ecology studies, primarily by providing more justification, detail, and context for these important parameters and others from the perspective of engineers and building scientists. It is our intent to provide microbial ecologists with knowledge of many of the tools available for built environment data collection, as well as some of the constraints and considerations for these tools, which may improve our ability to design indoor microbial ecology studies that can better inform building design and operation.},

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases in Spain resulting in more than 20,800 deaths as of April 21, 2020. Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10~±~3.5\% and 10~±~2.1\% in influent water (n~=~2) and 3.3~±~1.6\% and 6.2~±~1.0\% in effluent water (n~=~2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4~±~0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.},

  abstract = {Nuisance blue-green algal blooms contribute to aesthetic degradation of water resources by means of accelerated eutrophication, taste and odor problems, and the production of toxins that can have serious adverse human health effects. Current field-based methods for detecting blooms are costly and time consuming, delaying management decisions. Methods have been developed for estimating phycocyanin concentration, the accessory pigment unique to freshwater blue-green algae, in productive inland water. By employing the known optical properties of phycocyanin, researchers have evaluated the utility of field-collected spectral response patterns for determining concentrations of phycocyanin pigments and ultimately blue-green algal abundance. The purpose of this research was to evaluate field spectroscopy as a rapid cyanobacteria bloom assessment method. In-situ field reflectance spectra were collected at 54 sampling sites on two turbid reservoirs on September 6th and 7th in Indianapolis, Indiana using ASD Fieldspec (UV/VNIR) spectroradiometers. Surface water samples were analyzed for in-vitro pigment concentrations and other physical and chemical water quality parameters. Semi-empirical algorithms by Simis et al. [Simis, S., Peters, S., Gons, H. (2005). Remote sensing of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin in turbid inland water. American Society of Limnology and Oceanography 50(11): 237-245] were applied to the field spectra to predict chlorophyll a and phycocyanin absorption at 665 nm and 620 nm, respectively. For estimation of phycocyanin concentration, a specific absorption coefficient of 0.0070 m2 mg PC-1 for phycocyanin at 620 nm, aPC*(620), was employed, yielding an r2 value of 0.85 (n = 48, p {$<$} 0.0001), mean relative residual value of 0.51 ([sigma] = 1.41) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.54 ppb. Results suggest this algorithm could be a robust model for estimating phycocyanin. Error is highest in water with phycocyanin concentrations of less than 10 ppb and where phycocyanin abundance is low relative to chlorophyll a. A strong correlation between measured phycocyanin concentrations and biovolume measurements of cyanobacteria was also observed (r = 0.89), while a weaker relationship (r = 0.66) resulted between chlorophyll a concentration and cyanobacterial biovolume.},

Comparisons to previously published data revealed that this coastal bacterioplankton clone library was dominated by SSU rRNA gene phylotypes originally described from surface waters of the open ocean, but also revealed unique SSU rRNA gene lineages of beta Proteobacteria related to those found in clone libraries from freshwater habitats. beta Proteobacteria lineages common to coastal and freshwater samples included members of a clade of obligately methylotrophic bacteria, SSU rRNA genes affiliated with Xylophilus ampelinus, and a clade related to the genus Duganella. Ln addition, SSU rRNA genes were recovered from such previously recognized marine bacterioplankton SSU rRNA gene clone clusters as the SAR86, SAR11, and SAR116 clusters within the class Proteobacteria, the Roseobacter clade of the alpha subclass of the Proteobacteria, the marine group A/SAR406 cluster, and the marine Actinobacteria clade. Overall, these results support and extend previous observations concerning the global distribution of several marine planktonic prokaryote SSU rRNA gene phylotypes, but also show that coastal bacterioplankton communities contain SSU rRNA gene lineages (and presumably bacterioplankton) shown previously to be prevalent in freshwater habitats.

A High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method was improved in order to be able to accurately quantify pigments over such a large range of trophic levels, and especially from strongly oligotrophic conditions. Seven diagnostic pigments were associated to three phytoplankton size classes (pico-, nano and microphytoplankton). The total chlorophyll-a concentrations [TChla] in surface waters were the lowest measured in the centre of the gyre, reaching 0.017 mg m(-3). Pigment concentrations at the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) were generally 10 fold the surface values. Results were compared to predictions from a global parameterisation based on remotely sensed surface [TChla]. The agreement between the in situ and predicted data for such contrasting phytoplankton assemblages was generally good: throughout the oligotrophic gyre system, picophytoplankton (prochlorophytes and cyanophytes) and nanophytoplankton were the dominant classes. Relative bacteriochlorophyll-a concentrations varied around 2\%. The transition zone between the Marquesas and the SPSG was also well predicted by the model. However, some regional characteristics have been observed where measured and modelled data differ. Amongst these features is the extreme depth of the DCM (180 m) towards the centre of the gyre, the presence of a deep nanoflagellate population beneath the DCM or the presence of a prochlorophyte-enriched population in the formation area of the high salinity South Pacific Tropical Water. A coastal site sampled in the eutrophic upwelling zone, characterised by recently upwelled water, was significantly and unusually enriched in picoeucaryotes, in contrast with an offshore upwelling site where a more typical senescent diatom population prevailed.},

  abstract = {Large ({$>$}500 μm), suspended particles of organic and inorganic material, often referred to as 'marine snow', are considered important in the vertical transport and biogeochemical transformation of particulate organic carbon in the marine environment. Previous work has indicated that bacterial species inhabiting marine snow particles may differ greatly from those commonly found living free in the surrounding water column. To further characterize marine-snow-attached bacterial populations, we sampled marine snow by SCUBA diving during periods of intense macroaggregate formation in the northern Adriatic Sea in August 1991. Small subunit ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragments of bacteria were amplified from extracted nucleic acids by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The diversity of the recovered rDNA clones was initially assessed by comparing restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of individual clones. Ninety-five bacterial clones examined yielded 90 different RFLP patterns, representing an estimated sampling coverage of only 5.3\%. Sequence analysis of 39 randomly chosen clones was used to assess the general phylogenetic affiliation of individual clones. Bacterial phyla represented in the library included affiliates of the Planctomyces, the Gram-positive bacteria, the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) lineage, and the alpha-, gamma-, delta-, and epsilon-subdivisions of the Proteobacteria. The results suggest that bacterial colonization of suspended marine macroaggregates can result in diverse and complex assemblages, with specific phyla, such as the CFB, being commonly associated with marine particles. Futhermore, this particle-attached bacterial assemblage was similar to other bacterial assemblages found in marine sediments and terrestrial soils, with respect to the nature of the associated phylogenetic groups.},

  abstract = {Understanding how turbulence impacts marine floc formation and breakup is key to predicting particulate carbon transport in the ocean. While floc formation and sinking rate has been studied in the laboratory and in-situ, the breakup response to turbulence has attracted less attention. To address this problem, the breakup response of bentonite clay particles flocculated in salt water was studied experimentally. Flocs were grown in a large aggregation tank under unmixed and mixed aggregation conditions and then subjected to turbulent pipe flow. Particle size was quantified using microscope imaging and in-situ measurements obtained from standard optical oceanographic instruments; a Sequoia Scientific LISST-100X and two WET Labs ac-9 spectrophotometers. The LISST instrument was found to capture the breakup response of flocs to turbulent energy, though the resulting particle size spectra appear to have underestimated the largest floc lengthscales in the flow while overestimating the abundance of primary particles. Floc breakup and the resulting shift towards smaller particles caused an increase in spectral slope of attenuation as measured by the ac-9 instruments. The Kolmogorov lengthscale was not found to have a limiting effect on floc size in these experiments. While the flocs were found to decrease in overall strength over the course of the two-month experimental time period, repeatable breakup responses to turbulence exposure were observed. Hydrodynamic conditions during floc formation were found to have a large influence on floc strength and breakup response. A non-constant strength exponent was observed for flocs formed with more energetic mixing. Increased turbulence from mixing during aggregation was found to increase floc fractal dimension and apparent density, resulting in a shift in the breakup relationships to higher turbulence dissipation rates. The results suggest that marine particle aggregation and vertical carbon transport concepts should include the turbulence energy responsible for aggregate formation and the resulting impact on floc strength, density, and the disruption potential.},

Currently, however, we lack a full mechanistic understanding of how oxygen deficiency affects organic carbon cycling and burial. Here, we show that cryptic microbial sulfate reduction occurs in sinking particles from the eastern tropical North Pacific oxygen-deficient zone and that some microbially produced sulfide reacts rapidly to form organic sulfur that is resistant to acid hydrolysis. Particle-hosted sulfurization could enhance carbon preservation in sediments underlying oxygen-deficient water columns and serve as a stabilizing feedback between expanding anoxic zones and atmospheric carbon dioxide. A similar mechanism may help explain more-extreme instances of organic carbon preservation associated with marine anoxia in Earth history.},

Mean drainfield DIP (dissolved inorganic phosphorus) and DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) concentrations varied between 294 to 336 and 4494 to 5391 μmol/L, respectively, with mean fecal coliform bacteria densities ranging from 105.04 to 106.29 MPN (most probable number) /100 mL. DIP and fecal coliform bacteria exhibited a high degree of attenuation with shoreline concentrations at or near background levels. In contrast, septic tank nitrogen loadings to shallow ground water were significant and resulted in mean shoreline DIN concentrations ∼50 to 100 times greater than adjacent surface water concentrations. Mean site sediment DIP and DIN flux to surface waters varied from 1.1 to 1.6 and 52 to 135 μmol/m2/hr, respectively. Whereas DIP sediment fluxes were similar to reported values for sites adjacent to forested and agricultural lands, DIN fluxes were elevated compared to forested lands and near the lower end of the range reported for agricultural lands within the southern Chesapeake Bay region. Maximum measured sediment DIN flux was 1514 μmol/m2/hr. Estimated waste water nitrogen loading to shallow ground water (5.7 to 10.7 kg/household/yr) was significant and with 0.5 to 1 acre lot sizes, comparable to water table nitrogen loadings from dominant row-crop land use in the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain. Given the trends in population growth in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and other coastal regions, nitrogen loads from septic tanks to these systems should also be expected to increase.},

  abstract = {Acoustic data are invaluable information sources for characterizing the distribution and abundance of mid-trophic-level organisms (micronekton). These organisms play a pivotal role in the ecosystem as prey of top predators and as predators of low-trophic-level organisms. Although shipboard-ADCP (acoustic Doppler current profiler) acoustic backscatter signal intensity cannot provide an absolute biomass estimate, it may be a useful proxy to investigate variability in the distribution and relative density of micronekton. This study used acoustic recordings data spread across 19 years (1999–2017) from 54 ADCP cruises in New Caledonia's subtropical EEZ (exclusive economic zone) to assess seasonal and interannual variabilities and spatial distribution of micronekton. The dataset was composed of two different ADCPs: 150~kHz for the first period, followed by 75~kHz for more recent years. We examined the 20–120~m averaged scattering layer. Using the few cruises with concurrent EK60 measurements, we proposed that the backscatter from the ADCPs and 70~kHz EK60 were sufficiently closely linked to allow the use of the backscatter signal from the ADCPs in a combined dataset over the full time series. We then designed a GAMM (generalized additive mixed model) model that takes into account the two ADCP devices as well as temporal variability. After accounting for the effect of the devices, we showed that the acoustic signal was mainly driven by diel vertical migration, season, year, and ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation). In a second step, a consensus model between two statistical approaches (GAMM and SVM) (support vector machine) was constructed, linking the nighttime 20–120~m backscatter to the oceanographic and geographic environment. This model showed that sea surface temperature was the main factor driving backscatter variability in the EEZ, with intensified backscatter during the austral summer (December to May) in the northern part of the EEZ. We showed that acoustic density differed significantly, spatially and temporally from micronekton biomass predicted for the same period by the SEAPODYM-MTL (mid-trophic level) ecosystem model. The seasonal cycle given by ADCP data lagged behind the SEAPODYM-MTL seasonal cycle by around three months. Reasons to explain these differences and further needs in observation and modeling were explored in the discussion. In addition to providing new insights for micronekton dynamics in this EEZ (i.e., the science needed for ecosystem-based fisheries management), the data should help improve our ability to model this key trophic component.},

  abstract = {The extent to which water mass mixing contributes to the biological activity of the dark ocean is essentially unknown. Using a multiparameter water mass analysis, we examined the impact of water mass mixing on the nutrient distribution and microbial activity of the Northeast Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW) along an 8000\,km long transect extending from 62°N to 5°S. Mixing of four water types (WT) and basin scale mineralization from the site where the WT where defined to the study area explained up to 95\% of the variability in the distribution of inorganic nutrients and apparent oxygen utilization. Mixing-corrected average O2:N:P mineralization ratios of 127(±11):13.0(±0.7):1 in the core of the NEADW suggested preferential utilization of phosphorus compounds while dissolved organic carbon mineralization contributed a maximum of 20\% to the oxygen demand of the NEADW. In conjunction with the calculated average mineralization ratios, our results indicate a major contribution of particulate organic matter to the biological activity in the NEADW. The variability in prokaryotic abundance, high nucleic acid containing cells, and prokaryotic heterotrophic production in the NEADW was explained by large scale (64–79\%) and local mineralization processes (21–36\%), consistent with the idea that deep-water prokaryotic communities are controlled by substrate supply. Overall, our results suggest a major impact of mixing on the distribution of inorganic nutrients and a weaker influence on the dissolved organic matter pool supporting prokaryotic activity in the NEADW.},

  abstract = {We have developed a new kinetic model to study how microbial dynamics are affected by the heterogeneity in the physical structure of the environment and by different strategies for hydrolysis of polymeric carbon. The hybrid model represented the dynamics of substrates and enzymes using a continuum representation and the dynamics of the cells were modeled individually. Individual-based biological model allowed us to explicitly simulate microbial diversity, and to model cell physiology as regulated via optimal allocation of cellular resources to enzyme synthesis, control of growth rate by protein synthesis capacity, and shifts to dormancy. This model was developed to study how microbial community functioning is influenced by local environmental conditions in heterogeneous media such as soil and by the functional attributes of individual microbes. Microbial community dynamics were simulated at two spatial scales: micro-pores that resemble 6–20-μm size portions of the soil physical structure and in 111-μm size soil aggregates with a random pore structure. Different strategies for acquisition of carbon from polymeric cellulose were investigated. Bacteria that express membrane-associated hydrolase had different growth and survival dynamics in soil pores than bacteria that release extracellular hydrolases. The kinetic differences suggested different functional niches for these two microbe types in cellulose utilization. Our model predicted an emergent behavior in which co-existence of membrane-associated hydrolase and extracellular hydrolases releasing organisms led to higher cellulose utilization efficiency and reduced stochasticity. Our analysis indicated that their co-existence mutually benefits these organisms, where basal cellulose degradation activity by membrane-associated hydrolase-expressing cells shortened the soluble hydrolase buildup time and, when enzyme buildup allowed for cellulose degradation to be fast enough to sustain exponential growth, all the organisms in the community shared the soluble carbon product and grew together. Although pore geometry affected the kinetics of cellulose degradation, the patterns observed for the bacterial community dynamics in the 6–20 μm-sized micro-pores were relevant to the dynamics in the more complex 111-μm-sized porous soil aggregates, implying that micro-scale studies can be useful approximations to aggregate scale studies when local effects on microbial dynamics are studied. As shown with examples in this study, various functional niches of the bacterial communities can be investigated using complex predictive mathematical models where the role of key environmental aspects such as the heterogeneous three-dimensional structure, functional niches of the community members, and environmental biochemical processes are directly connected to microbial metabolism and maintenance in an integrated model.},

Although members of the enterovirus group have been suggested as possible indicators of sewage pollution in marine waters, the lack of rapid, sensitive and cost effective methods have prevented routine monitoring in the United States. This study compared traditional cell culture and direct RT-PCR (reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction) amplification for detection of an enterovirus. Poliovirus could be recovered from 100 L of artificial seawater with an average efficiency of 77\%, using adsorption and elution from electronegative filters. Viruses were eluted from the filters with 1.5\% beef extract for viruses (BEV) adjusted to pH 9.5 and reconcentrated by organic flocculation to a volume of 30 mL. Substances which interfered with detection by RT-PCR were removed by treatment of the concentrates with sephadex and chelex resins. Direct RT-PCR could detect 2.5 and 0.025 PFU (plaque forming units) for single (25 cycles) and double PCR (2 × 25 cycles) in 10 µL of pure culture poliovirus samples, respectively. These methods are currently being applied to assess the occurrence of enteroviruses at marine bathing beaches influenced by sewage discharges.},

  abstract = {In terrestrial ecosystems, transitional areas between different plant communities (ecotones) are formed by steep environmental gradients and are commonly characterized by high species diversity and primary productivity, which in turn influences the foodweb structure of these regions. Whether comparable zones of elevated diversity and productivity characterize ecotones in the oceans remains poorly understood. Here we describe a previously hidden hotspot of phytoplankton diversity and productivity in a narrow but seasonally persistent transition zone at the intersection of iron-poor, nitrate-rich offshore waters and iron-rich, nitrate-poor coastal waters of the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Novel continuous measurements of phytoplankton cell abundance and composition identified a complex succession of blooms of five distinct size classes of phytoplankton populations within a 100-km–wide transition zone. The blooms appear to be fueled by natural iron enrichment of offshore communities as they are transported toward the coast. The observed succession of phytoplankton populations is likely driven by spatial gradients in iron availability or time since iron enrichment. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the resulting communities have a strong impact on the regional biogeochemistry as evidenced by the low partial pressure of CO2 and the nearly complete depletion of nutrients. Enhanced phytoplankton productivity and diversity associated with steep environmental gradients are expected wherever water masses with complementary nutrient compositions mix to create a region more favorable for phytoplankton growth. The ability to detect and track these important but poorly characterized marine ecotones is critical for understanding their impact on productivity and ecosystem structure in the oceans.},

  abstract = {Vibrio tubiashii is reported to be a bacterial pathogen of larval Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and has been associated with major hatchery crashes, causing shortages in seed oysters for commercial shellfish producers. Another bacterium, Vibrio coralliilyticus, a well-known coral pathogen, has recently been shown to elicit mortality in fish and shellfish. Several strains of V. coralliilyticus, such as ATCC 19105 and Pacific isolates RE22 and RE98, were misidentified as V. tubiashii until recently. We compared the mortalities caused by two V. tubiashii and four V. coralliilyticus strains in Eastern and Pacific oyster larvae. The 50\% lethal dose (LD50) of V. coralliilyticus in Eastern oysters (defined here as the dose required to kill 50\% of the population in 6 days) ranged from 1.1 × 104 to 3.0 × 104 CFU/ml seawater; strains RE98 and RE22 were the most virulent. This study shows that V. coralliilyticus causes mortality in Eastern oyster larvae. Results for Pacific oysters were similar, with LD50s between 1.2 × 104 and 4.0 × 104 CFU/ml. Vibrio tubiashii ATCC 19106 and ATCC 19109 were highly infectious toward Eastern oyster larvae but were essentially nonpathogenic toward healthy Pacific oyster larvae at dosages of ≥1.1 × 104 CFU/ml. These data, coupled with the fact that several isolates originally thought to be V. tubiashii are actually V. coralliilyticus, suggest that V. coralliilyticus has been a more significant pathogen for larval bivalve shellfish than V. tubiashii, particularly on the U.S. West Coast, contributing to substantial hatchery-associated morbidity and mortality in recent years.},

  abstract = {The formation of calcareous skeletons by marine planktonic organisms and their subsequent sinking to depth generates a continuous rain of calcium carbonate to the deep ocean and underlying sediments(1). This is important in regulating marine carbon cycling and ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange(2). The present rise in atmospheric CO2 levels(3) causes significant changes in surface ocean pH and carbonate chemistry(4). Such changes have been shown to slow down calcification in corals and coralline macroalgae(5,6), but the majority of marine calcification occurs in planktonic organisms. Here we report reduced calcite production at increased CO2 concentrations in monospecific cultures of two dominant marine calcifying phytoplankton species, the coccolithophorids Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica. This was accompanied by an increased proportion of malformed coccoliths and incomplete coccospheres. Diminished calcification led to a reduction in the ratio of calcite precipitation to organic matter production. Similar results were obtained in incubations of natural plankton assemblages from the north Pacific ocean when exposed to experimentally elevated CO2 levels. We suggest that the progressive increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may therefore slow down the production of calcium carbonate in the surface ocean. As the process of calcification releases CO2 to the atmosphere, the response observed here could potentially act as a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 levels.},

  abstract = {Bacteria growing on marine particles generally have higher densities and cell-specific activities than free-living bacteria. Since rapidity of phage adsorption is dependent on host density, while infection productivity is a function of host physiological status, we hypothesized that marine particles are sites of elevated phage production. In the present study, organic-matter-rich agarose beads and a marine phage–host pair (Cellulophaga sp., ΦSM) were used as a model system to examine whether bacterial colonization of particles increases phage production. While no production of phages was observed in plain seawater, the presence of beads enhanced attachment and growth of bacteria, as well as phage production. This was observed because of extensive lysis of bacteria in the presence of beads and a subsequent increase in phage abundance both on beads and in the surrounding water. After 12 h, extensive phage lysis reduced the density of attached bacteria; however, after 32 h, bacterial abundance increased again. Reexposure to phages and analyses of bacterial isolates suggested that this regrowth on particles was by phage-resistant clones. The present demonstration of elevated lytic phage production associated with model particles illustrates not only that a marine phage has the ability to successfully infect and lyse surface-attached bacteria but also that acquisition of resistance may affect temporal phage–host dynamics on particles. These findings from a model system may have relevance to the distribution of phage production in environments rich in particulate matter (e.g., in coastal areas or during phytoplankton blooms) where a significant part of phage production may be directly linked to these nutrient-rich “hot spots.”},

However, more pronounced differences were observed among samples from 5 stations on a transect crossing the Skagerrak-Kattegat front where 2 water masses with different physico-chemical properties meet, The 2 water masses harbored distinct bacterial and viral communities, and a gradual mixing of the microbial communities was observed across the front. Our study indicates stability of microbial community compositions in Danish coastal waters and suggests that changes in microbial abundance and activity were not associated with successions in bacterial and viral communities discernible by the applied DGGE and PFGE protocols.},

Moreover, whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of isolated strains was performed.

Moreover, the rate of positivity in raw wastewater samples decreased after eight days, in congruence with the epidemiological trend estimated for the interested provinces. Virus infectiveness was always not significant, indicating the effectiveness of wastewater treatments, or the natural decay of viral vitality, which implied the absence of significant risk of infection from wastewaters. Samples from receiving rivers (two sites, sampled in the same dates as wastewaters) showed in some cases a positivity to PCR amplification, probably due to non-treated discharges, or the combined sewage overflows. Nevertheless, also for rivers vitality was negligible, indicating the absence of sanitary risks.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The German Bight of the North Sea is characterized by intertidal flats, with high loads of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and estuarine inputs of organic matter, as well as pelagic offshore regions. Due to tidal and wind-induced currents, the hydrography of this area is highly dynamic. In order to examine how these properties affect the regional distribution and composition of the bacterioplankton we conducted 2 surveys, in June 2002 and June 2003; in these surveys we assessed the composition of the free-living (FL) and particle-associated (PA) bacterial communities together with hydrographic properties (salinity, temperature) and biogeochemical properties (SPM, particulate organic carbon, chlorophyll, phytoplankton composition). The bacterial community composition was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic (DGGE) analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments, PCR-amplified by Bacteria-, Alphaproteobacteria- and Bacteroidetes-specific primer sets, and sequencing of excised bands. The results, and a multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis of the DGGE banding patterns, showed distinct differences in the bacterial community composition of the FL and PA fractions and also between the inshore and offshore stations. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), including the DGGE banding patterns, temperature, salinity and biogeochemical parameters, further showed that the community patterns and the inshore and offshore gradients can be explained to a great extent by the hydrographic and biogeochemical conditions. Several prominent bands, identified as phylotypes affiliated to the Roseobacter clade, persisted throughout all 10 stations ­visited, whereas other phylotypes occurred only at distinct stations, inshore and offshore.},

DVM of the euphausiid Euphausia eximia off northern Chile in the spring of 2015 was documented based on acoustic measurements using an echo sounder along with net samplings. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were obtained using a vertical profiler, and water samples were collected to obtain in situ nitrite (NO2−) concentrations as well as pHT, total alkalinity (AT), and therefore carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) was estimated. Krill were found to migrate up to the surface (0–50~m) during the night and returned to ca. 200–300~m depth during the day, spending between 11 and 14~h at these layers. At the surface, DO and NO2− concentrations were 208 and 0.14~μM respectively, while pHT was 8.04 and 405 μatm pCO2. In contrast, at the deeper layers (200–300~m), DO and NO2− were\,{$<$}\,3 and 6.3~μM respectively, with pHT 7.53 and 1490 μatm pCO2. The pHT and high pCO2 values at depths represent the conditions predicted for open ocean waters in a worst-case global warming scenario by 2150. The acoustic scatter suggested that\,{$>$}\,60\% of the krill swarms enter the OMZ and anoxic waters during the daytime. These frequent migrations suggest that krill can tolerate such extreme conditions associated with anoxic and high-pCO2 waters. The inferences drawn from the observation of these migrations might have strong implications for the current oceanic carbon pump models, highlighting the need for understanding the molecular and physiological adaptations allowing these migrations.},

  abstract = {Despite the obvious relevance of the high latitude oceans to models and budgets of biogenic carbon, the seasonal patterns of energy flow through the lower food web in this region are poorly understood. It has been suggested that, in high latitude and cold oceans, the rates of bacterial metabolism and growth are low and are depressed to a much greater degree than those of co-occurring phytoplankton and metazoan heterotrophs. The low-temperature suppression of bacterial growth would reduce microbial food web activity, bacteria would consume and recycle less primary production and more phytoplankton carbon would be available to metazoan grazers. The implications of this scenario for models of oceanic carbon flow are profound. In this paper, we present an analysis of 66 published studies on temperature and growth rate for bacteria from the World Ocean, including polar regions, and examine the results of a field investigation of bacterioplankton growth in seasonally cold Newfoundland (eastern Canada) coastal waters. Based upon the analysis of published data, where approximately 50\% of the observations were from environments {$<$}=4*C, we report a weak (r2 = 0.058, n = 231) relationship between specific growth rate (SGR) and temperature with a Q10 = 1.5. The mean (0.39 to 0.41 d-1) and median (0.25 to 0.29 d-1) SGR of bacteria from cold ({$<$}=4*C) and warm ({$>$}4*C) waters were not significantly different. For both the published data as well as for the field study in Conception Bay, Newfoundland, the SGR was significantly greater (p {$<$} 0.01) when computed from empirical thymidine conversion factors than from theoretical or literature derived thymidine conversion factors. Our analysis suggests that the growth rates of bacterioplankton from cold and temperate oceans are similar at their respective ambient temperatures, when the appropriate conversion factors are used to compute growth. We propose that bacteria-based food webs and microbial trophic pathways are as important in overall energy and material cycling in high latitude oceans as they are at lower latitudes.},

  abstract = {The forward light scatter intensity of bacteria analyzed by flow cytometry varied with their dry mass, in accordance with theory. A standard curve was formulated with Rayleigh-Gans theory to accommodate cell shape and alignment. It was calibrated with an extinction-culture isolate of the small marine organism Cycloclasticus oligotrophus, for which dry weight was determined by CHN analysis and 14C-acetate incorporation. Increased light scatter intensity due to formaldehyde accumulation in preserved cells was included in the standard curve. When differences in the refractive indices of culture media and interspecies differences in the effects of preservation were taken into account, there was agreement between cell mass obtained by flow cytometry for various bacterial species and cell mass computed from Coulter Counter volume and buoyant density. This agreement validated the standard curve and supported the assumption that cells were aligned in the flow stream. Several subpopulations were resolved in a mixture of three species analyzed according to forward light scatter and DNA-bound DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) fluorescence intensity. The total biomass of the mixture was 340 μg/liter. The lowest value for mean dry mass, 0.027 ± 0.008 pg/cell, was for the subpopulation of C. oligotrophuscontaining cells with a single chromosome. Calculations from measurements of dry mass, Coulter Counter volume, and buoyant density revealed that the dry weight of the isolate was 14 to 18\% of its wet weight, compared to 30\% for Escherichia coli. The method is suitable for cells with 0.005 to about 1.2 pg of dry weight at concentrations of as low as 103 cells/ml and offers a unique capability for determining biomass distributions in mixed bacterial populations.},

Analysis of the results from these data sets confirmed that the ocean outfall was not the FIB source responsible for the postings and closures of local beaches that have occurred each summer since 1999. While FIB counts in the final effluent and offshore showed several order of magnitude reductions after disinfection, there were no significant reductions at the nearby surf zone stations. Additionally, the FIB spectral patterns suggest different sources. The dominant fortnightly cycle suggested that the source was related to the wetting and draining of the land from large spring tide tidal excursions.},

  abstract = {The mesopelagic zone is the oceanic region through which carbon and other elements must pass in order to reach deeper waters or the sea floor. However, the food web interactions that occur in the mesopelagic zone are difficult to measure and so, despite their crucial importance to global elemental cycles, are not very well known. Recent developments in technology and new approaches have advanced the study of the variability in and controls upon the distribution and diversity of organisms in the mesopelagic zone, including the roles of respiration, recycling, and repackaging of particulate and dissolved organic material. However, there are remarkably few syntheses of the ecology and biogeochemistry of the microbes and metazoa that permanently reside or habitually visit this ‘twilight zone’. Without this synthesis, it is difficult to assess the impact of ongoing changes in ocean hydrography and chemistry, due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, on the biological carbon pump. This paper reviews what is known about the distribution of microbes and metazoa in the mesopelagic zone in relation to their activity and impact on global biogeochemical cycles. Thus, gaps in our knowledge are identified and suggestions made for priority research programmes that will improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on carbon sequestration.},

A simple model is used to examine the bloom dynamics and the unusual conditions that produced it. Laboratory trials were conducted to determine the response to salinity of M. aeruginosa, while other parameters for the model were obtained from the literature. Growth was found to be optimal at salinities up to 4, and declined to zero at 25. The unseasonable summer rainfall flushed brackish and marine water from the estuary and produced a surface mixed layer with low salinity. The model simulations show that the hydrological conditions, in combination with high concentrations of inorganic nutrients (dissolved inorganic nitrogen {$>$}1.2 mg L–1, filterable reactive phosphorus {$>$}0.02 mg L–1) in river inflows, high water temperature and high daily insolation, promoted rapid phytoplankton growth, favouring dominance by M. aeruginosa. Doubling rates during the bloom were around 0.35 day–1 and cell counts exceeded 105 cells mL–1 within three weeks of the inflow event. Although this doubling rate ultimately determined the total bloom biomass, local concentrations were strongly influenced by physical processes that concentrated M. aeruginosa cells both vertically and horizontally, and advected a seed population from the upper estuary into the lower basin.},

Here we found a highly conserved RNA secondary structure, the regulatory B12 element, which is widely distributed in the upstream regions of cobalamin biosynthetic/transport genes in eubacteria. In addition, the binding signal (CBL-box) for a hypothetical B12 regulator was identified in some archaea. A search for B12 elements and CBL-boxes and positional analysis identified a large number of new candidate B12-regulated genes in various prokaryotes. Among newly assigned functions associated with the cobalamin biosynthesis, there are several new types of cobalt transporters, ChlI and ChlD subunits of the CobN-dependent cobaltochelatase complex, cobalt reductase BluB, adenosyltransferase PduO, several new proteins linked to the lower ligand assembly pathway, l-threonine kinase PduX, and a large number of other hypothetical proteins. Most missing genes detected within the cobalamin biosynthetic pathways of various bacteria were identified as nonorthologous substitutes. The variable parts of the cobalamin metabolism appear to be the cobalt transport and insertion, the CobG/CbiG- and CobF/CbiD-catalyzed reactions, and the lower ligand synthesis pathway. The most interesting result of analysis of B12 elements is that B12-independent isozymes of the methionine synthase and ribonucleotide reductase are regulated by B12 elements in bacteria that have both B12-dependent and B12-independent isozymes. Moreover, B12 regulons of various bacteria are thought to include enzymes from known B12-dependent or alternative pathways.},

Previous phylogenetic analyses have suggested that Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique, the first cultured member of this group, is related to the Rickettsiales+mitochondria clade whereas others disagree with this conclusion. In order to determine the evolutionary position of the SAR11 group and its relationship to the origin of mitochondria, we have performed phylogenetic analyses on the concatenation of 24 proteins from 5 mitochondria and 71 proteobacteria. Our results support that SAR11 group is not the sistergroup of the Rickettsiales+mitochondria clade and confirm that the position of this group in the alpha-proteobacterial tree is strongly affected by tree reconstruction artefacts due to compositional bias. As a consequence, genome reduction and bias toward a high A+T content may have evolved independently in the SAR11 species, which points to a different direction in the quest for the closest relatives to mitochondria and Rickettsiales. In addition, our analyses raise doubts about the monophyly of the newly proposed Pelagibacteraceae family.},

We therefore propose the constant-diversity dynamics model, in which the diversity of prokaryotic populations is preserved by phage predation. We provide supporting evidence for this model from metagenomics, mathematical analysis and computer simulations. Periodic selection and phage predation dynamics are not mutually exclusive; we compare their predictions to shed light on the ecological circumstances under which each type of dynamics could predominate.},

Extreme cold, heat (from possible hydrothermal activity), pressure (from the overriding glacier) and dissolved oxygen (delivered by melting meteoric ice), in addition to limited nutrients and complete darkness, combine to produce one of the most extreme environments on Earth. Metagenomic/metatranscriptomic analyses of ice that accreted over a shallow embayment and over the southern main lake basin indicate the presence of thousands of species of organisms (94\% Bacteria, 6\% Eukarya, and two Archaea). The predominant bacterial sequences were closest to those from species of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, while the predominant eukaryotic sequences were most similar to those from species of ascomycetous and basidiomycetous Fungi. Based on the sequence data, the lake appears to contain a mixture of autotrophs and heterotrophs capable of performing nitrogen fixation, nitrogen cycling, carbon fixation and nutrient recycling.

The Phage Proteomic Tree places phage relative to both their near neighbors and all other phage included in the analysis.

One group corresponded to polluted samples from the plume of landfill leachate and the second group to clean samples from outside the plume. Most Probable Number-Biolog was used to select Eco Biolog plates with similar inoculum densities. Analysis of substrate utilization profiles of these plates revealed that anaerobic microbial communities in polluted samples clustered separately from those in clean samples. Especially substrates containing an aromatic nucleus were more utilized by microbial communities in the leachate plume. Both substrate richness and functional diversity were significantly enhanced in the plume of pollution. This study shows that community-level physiological profiling is a useful and simple tool to distinguish between anaerobic microbial communities in and near a landfill leachate plume.},

Successful reproduction requires different strategies when resources are scarce and when they are abundant1,2, but a systematic framework for predicting these reproductive strategies in bacteria has not been available. Here, we show that the number of ribosomal RNA operons (rrn) in bacterial genomes predicts two important components of reproduction—growth rate and growth efficiency—which are favoured under contrasting regimes of resource availability3,4. We find that the maximum reproductive rate of bacteria doubles with a doubling of rrn copy number, and the efficiency of carbon use is inversely related to maximal growth rate and rrn copy number. We also identify a feasible explanation for these patterns: the rate and yield of protein synthesis mirror the overall pattern in maximum growth rate and growth efficiency. Furthermore, comparative analysis of genomes from 1,167 bacterial species reveals that rrn copy number predicts traits associated with resource availability, including chemotaxis and genome streamlining. Genome-wide patterns of orthologous gene content covary with rrn copy number, suggesting convergent evolution in response to resource availability. Our findings imply that basic cellular processes adapt in contrasting ways to long-term differences in resource availability. They also establish a basis for predicting changes in bacterial community composition in response to resource perturbations using rrn copy number measurements5 or inferences6,7.},

In these habitats, selection should favor microbes that are able to use resources most efficiently, that is, microbes that produce the most progeny per unit of resource consumed. On the basis of this assertion, we propose that selection for efficiency is a primary driver of the composition of microbial communities. In this article, we review how the quality and quantity of resources influence the efficiency of heterotrophic growth. A conceptual model proposing innate differences in growth efficiency between oligotrophic and copiotrophic microbes is also provided. We conclude that elucidation of the mechanisms underlying efficient growth will enhance our understanding of the selective pressures shaping microbes and will improve our capacity to manage microbial communities effectively.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: We measured the distribution of hydrographic parameters, currents, phytoplankton fluorescence, suspended sediments and zooplankton in axial transects through the Chesapeake Bay estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) seasonally (May, July and October 1996) and over tidal cycles within seasons. Zooplankton abundance was estimated with a 6-frequency, Tracor Acoustical Profiling System (TAPS-6) at the same vertical (0.25 to 0.50 m) and horizontal (0.5 to 1.5 km) resolution as hydrographic parameters and suspended sediments. The general pattern exhibited in axial transects through the Chesapeake Bay ETM is that sediments, fluorescence and zooplankton are in higher concentrations up-Bay of the salt wedge (defined as the intersection of the 1 isohaline with the bottom). The salinity front appears to trap these particles in the upper portion of Chesapeake Bay. The highest acoustically determined zooplankton biomass generally occurred near the bottom, at the toe of the salt wedge. The convergence zone associated with this feature concentrates sediments and zooplankton (primarily the copepod Eurytemora affinis). Advection appeared to dominate changes in zooplankton abundance during time series studies at a fixed station in the ETM. Zooplankton biomass at the fixed ETM station increased/decreased with the tidal excursion of the salt wedge. Water column zooplankton concentrations and the vertical distribution of zooplankton biomass appeared to be influenced by currents. We often found that during maximum ebb and flood tidal currents, zooplankton biomass and sediments in the mid and upper water column increased. Thus the hydrodynamic processes that resuspend, advect and trap suspended sediments in the ETM likely have the same effects on zooplankton. The ETM of the Chesapeake Bay appears to act as an entrapment zone for zooplankton. The lack of diel vertical migration, carrying eggs until they are ready to hatch, possible reduced predation by visual predators in the turbid waters, and the ability to consume phytoplankton, protozoa and detritus all may allow Eurytemora to persist at high concentrations in the Chesapeake Bay ETM.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the distribution of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the oceans and its role in the global carbon cycle requires a better knowledge of the colored materials produced and consumed by marine phytoplankton and bacteria. In this work, we examined the net uptake and release of CDOM by a natural bacterial community growing on DOM derived from four phytoplankton species cultured under axenic conditions. Fluorescent humic-like substances exuded by phytoplankton (excitation/emission [Ex/Em] wavelength, 310 nm/392 nm; Coble's peak M) were utilized by bacteria in different proportions depending on the phytoplankton species of origin. Furthermore, bacteria produced humic-like substances that fluoresce at an Ex/Em wavelength of 340 nm/440 nm (Coble's peak C). Differences were also observed in the Ex/Em wavelengths of the protein-like materials (Coble's peak T) produced by phytoplankton and bacteria. The induced fluorescent emission of CDOM produced by prokaryotes was an order of magnitude higher than that of CDOM produced by eukaryotes. We have also examined the final compositions of the bacterial communities growing on the exudates, which differed markedly depending on the phytoplankton species of origin. Alteromonas and Roseobacter were dominant during all the incubations on Chaetoceros sp. and Prorocentrum minimum exudates, respectively. Alteromonas was the dominant group growing on Skeletonema costatum exudates during the exponential growth phase, but it was replaced by Roseobacter afterwards. On Micromonas pusilla exudates, Roseobacter was replaced by Bacteroidetes after the exponential growth phase. Our work shows that fluorescence excitation-emission matrices of CDOM can be a helpful tool for the identification of microbial sources of DOM in the marine environment, but further studies are necessary to explore the association of particular bacterial groups with specific fluorophores.},

However, the current knowledge on mollusk viruses is mainly centered on few pathogenic viruses, whereas a general view of bivalve-associated viromes is lacking. This study was designed to explore the viral abundance and diversity in bivalve mollusks using transcriptomic datasets. From analyzing RNA-seq data of 58 bivalve species, we have reconstructed 26 nearly complete and over 413 partial RNA virus genomes. Although 96.4\% of the predicted viral proteins refer to new viruses, some sequences belong to viruses associated with bivalve species or other marine invertebrates. We considered short non-coding RNAs (sncRNA) and post-transcriptional modifications occurring specifically on viral RNAs as tools for virus host-assignment. We could not identify virus-derived small RNAs in sncRNA reads obtained from the oyster sample richest in viral reads. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed 938 A-to-G substitutions occurring on the 26 identified RNA viruses, preferentially impacting the AA di-nucleotide motif. Under-representation analysis revealed that the AA motif is under-represented in these bivalve-associated viruses. These findings improve our understanding of bivalve viromes, and set the stage for targeted investigations on the specificity and dynamics of identified viruses.},

However, the bacterial indicators currently used for monitoring water quality do not correlate with the presence of pathogens. Here we demonstrate that the plant pathogen Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) is widespread and abundant in wastewater from the United States, suggesting the utility of this virus as an indicator of human fecal pollution. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the abundance of PMMoV in raw sewage, treated wastewater, seawater exposed to wastewater, and fecal samples and/or intestinal homogenates from a wide variety of animals. PMMoV was present in all wastewater samples at concentrations greater than 1 million copies per milliliter of raw sewage. Despite the ubiquity of PMMoV in human feces, this virus was not detected in the majority of animal fecal samples tested, with the exception of chicken and seagull samples. PMMoV was detected in four out of six seawater samples collected near point sources of secondary treated wastewater off southeastern Florida, where it co-occurred with several other pathogens and indicators of fecal pollution. Since PMMoV was not found in nonpolluted seawater samples and could be detected in surface seawater for approximately 1 week after its initial introduction, the presence of PMMoV in the marine environment reflects a recent contamination event. Together, these data demonstrate that PMMoV is a promising new indicator of fecal pollution in coastal environments.},

Although circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS DNA) viruses are a widespread group for which our knowledge is rapidly expanding, biased sampling toward vertebrates and land plants has limited our understanding of their diversity and evolution. Here, we screened terrestrial arthropods for CRESS DNA viruses and report the identification of 44 viral genomes and replicons associated with specimens representing all three major terrestrial arthropod lineages, namely Euchelicerata (spiders), Hexapoda (insects), and Myriapoda (millipedes). We identified virus genomes belonging to three established CRESS DNA viral families (Circoviridae, Genomoviridae, and Smacoviridae); however, over half of the arthropod-associated viral genomes are only distantly related to currently classified CRESS DNA viral sequences. Although members of viral and satellite families known to infect plants (Geminiviridae, Nanoviridae, Alphasatellitidae) were not identified in this study, these plant-infecting CRESS DNA viruses and replicons are transmitted by hemipterans. Therefore, members from six out of the seven established CRESS DNA viral families circulate among arthropods. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of Reps, including endogenous viral sequences, reported to date from a wide array of organisms revealed that most of the known CRESS DNA viral diversity circulates among invertebrates. Our results highlight the vast and unexplored diversity of CRESS DNA viruses among invertebrates and parallel findings from RNA viral discovery efforts in undersampled taxa.},

Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) is one of the most abundant RNA viruses associated with human feces, making it a viable indicator for tracking fecal pollution in aquatic environments, including groundwater. In this study, groundwater samples collected from a karst aquifer from fresh and brackish water locations were analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria, somatic and male F+ specific coliphages, and PMMoV during the rainy and dry seasons. Total coliform bacteria were detected at all sites, whereas Escherichia coli were found at relatively low levels {$<$}40 MPN/100~ml. The highest average concentrations of somatic and male F+ specific coliphages were 920 and 330 plaque forming units per 100~ml, respectively, detected in freshwater during the rainy season. PMMoV RNA was detected in 85\% of the samples with gene sequences sharing 99–100\% of nucleotide identity with PMMoV sequences available in GenBank. Quantification of PMMoV genome copies (GC) by quantitative real-time PCR indicated concentrations ranging from 1.7~×~101 to 1.0~×~104 GC/L, with the highest number of GC detected during the rainy season. No significant correlation was observed between PMMoV occurrence by season or water type (p~{$>~$}0.05). Physicochemical and indicator bacteria were not correlated with PMMoV concentrations. The abundance and prevalence of PMMoV in the karst aquifer may reflect its environmental persistence and its potential as a fecal indicator in this karst aquifer system.},

What we previously thought of as insurmountable physical and chemical barriers to life, we now see as yet another niche harbouring 'extremophiles'. This realization, coupled with new data on the survival of microbes in the space environment and modelling of the potential for transfer of life between celestial bodies, suggests that life could be more common than previously thought. Here we examine critically what it means to be an extremophile, and the implications of this for evolution, biotechnology and especially the search for life in the Universe.},

  abstract = {Ocean microbes drive biogeochemical cycling on a global scale1. However, this cycling is constrained by viruses that affect community composition, metabolic activity, and evolutionary trajectories2,3. Owing to challenges with the sampling and cultivation of viruses, genome-level viral diversity remains poorly described and grossly understudied, with less than 1\% of observed surface-ocean viruses known4. Here we assemble complete genomes and large genomic fragments from both surface- and deep-ocean viruses sampled during the Tara Oceans and Malaspina research expeditions5,6, and analyse the resulting ‘global ocean virome’ dataset to present a global map of abundant, double-stranded DNA viruses complete with genomic and ecological contexts. A total of 15,222 epipelagic and mesopelagic viral populations were identified, comprising 867 viral clusters (defined as approximately genus-level groups7,8). This roughly triples the number of known ocean viral populations4 and doubles the number of candidate bacterial and archaeal virus genera8, providing a near-complete sampling of epipelagic communities at both the population and viral-cluster level. We found that 38 of the 867 viral clusters were locally or globally abundant, together accounting for nearly half of the viral populations in any global ocean virome sample. While two-thirds of these clusters represent newly described viruses lacking any cultivated representative, most could be computationally linked to dominant, ecologically relevant microbial hosts. Moreover, we identified 243 viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes, of which only 95 were previously known. Deeper analyses of four of these auxiliary metabolic genes (dsrC, soxYZ, P-II (also known as glnB) and amoC) revealed that abundant viruses may directly manipulate sulfur and nitrogen cycling throughout the epipelagic ocean. This viral catalog and functional analyses provide a necessary foundation for the meaningful integration of viruses into ecosystem models where they act as key players in nutrient cycling and trophic networks.},

  abstract = {In plankton ecology, it is a fundamental question as to how a large number of competing phytoplankton species coexist in marine ecosystems under a seemingly-limited variety of resources. This ever-green question was first proposed by Hutchinson [Hutchinson, G.E., 1961. The paradox of the plankton. Am. Nat. 95, 137–145] as ‘the paradox of the plankton’. Starting from Hutchinson [Hutchinson, G.E., 1961. The paradox of the plankton. Am. Nat. 95, 137–145], over more than four decades several investigators have put forward varieties of mechanisms for the extreme diversity of phytoplankton species. In this article, within the boundary of our knowledge, we review the literature of the proposed solutions and give a brief overview of the mechanisms proposed so far. The proposed mechanisms that we discuss mainly include spatial and temporal heterogeneity in physical and biological environment, externally imposed or self-generated spatial segregation, horizontal mesoscale turbulence of ocean characterized by coherent vortices, oscillation and chaos generated by several internal and external causes, stable coexistence and compensatory dynamics under fluctuating temperature in resource competition, and finally the role of toxin-producing phytoplankton in maintaining the coexistence and biodiversity of the overall plankton population that we have proposed recently. We find that, although the different mechanisms proposed so far is potentially applicable to specific ecosystems, a universally accepted theory for explaining plankton diversity in natural waters is still an unachieved goal.},

Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) is one such technique.

Owing to errors in sampling, random mutations in PCR amplification, and probably mostly variations in readings from the equipment used to analyze fragment sizes, the data read directly from the fragment analyzer should not be used for down stream statistical analysis. No optimal data preprocessing methods are available. A commonly used approach is to bin the reading lengths of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer. We have developed a dynamic programming algorithm based binning method for ARISA data analysis which minimizes the overall differences between replicates from the same sampling location and time. RESULTS: In a test example from an ocean time series sampling program, data preprocessing identified several outliers which upon re-examination were found to be because of systematic errors. Clustering analysis of the ARISA from different times based on the dynamic programming algorithm binned data revealed important features of the biodiversity of the microbial communities.},

The basics of glider function are discussed as implemented by University of Washington in Seaglider, Scripps Institution of Oceanography in Spray, and Webb Research in Slocum. Gliders sample in the archetypical-modes of sections and of “virtual moorings.” Preliminary results are presented from a recent demonstration project that used a network of gliders off Monterey. A wide range of sensors has already been deployed on gliders, with many under current development, and an even wider range of future possibilities. Glider networks appear to be one of the best approaches to achieving subsurface spatial resolution necessary for ocean research.},

  abstract = {Hypersaline lakes are characteristic for Western Australia and display a rare combination of geochemical and mineralogical properties that make these lakes potential analogues for past conditions on Mars. In our study, we focused on the geochemistry and mineralogy of Lake Orr and Lake Whurr. While both lakes are poor in organic carbon ({$<$}1\%), the sediments’ pH values differ and range from 3.8 to 4.8 in Lake Orr and from 5.4 to 6.3 in Lake Whurr sediments. Lake Whurr sediments were dominated by orange and red sediment zones in which the main Fe minerals were identified as hematite, goethite, and tentatively jarosite and pyrite. Lake Orr was dominated by brownish and blackish sediments where the main Fe minerals were goethite and another paramagnetic Fe(III)-phase that could not be identified. Furthermore, a likely secondary Fe(II)-phase was observed in Lake Orr sediments. The mineralogy of these two salt lakes in the sampling area is strongly influenced by events such as flooding, evaporation, and desiccation, processes that explain at least to some extent the observed differences between Lake Orr and Lake Whurr. The iron mineralogy of Lake Whurr sediments and the high salinity make this lake a suitable analogue for Meridiani Planum on Mars, and in particular the tentative identification of pyrite in Lake Whurr sediments has implications for the interpretation of the Fe mineralogy of Meridiani Planum sediments.

  abstract = {With the recognition of an increasing potential for discovery of extraterrestrial life, a diverse set of researchers have noted a need to examine the foundational ethical principles that should frame our collective space activities as we explore outer space. A COSPAR Workshop on Ethical Considerations for Planetary Protection in Space Exploration was convened at Princeton University on June 8–10, 2010, to examine whether planetary protection measures and practices should be extended to protect planetary environments within an ethical framework that goes beyond “science protection” per se. The workshop had been in development prior to a 2006 NRC report on preventing the forward contamination of Mars, although it responded directly to one of the recommendations of that report and to several peer-reviewed papers as well. The workshop focused on the implications and responsibilities engendered when exploring outer space while avoiding harmful impacts on planetary bodies. Over 3 days, workshop participants developed a set of recommendations addressing the need for a revised policy framework to address “harmful contamination” beyond biological contamination, noting that it is important to maintain the current COSPAR planetary protection policy for scientific exploration and activities. The attendees agreed that there is need for further study of the ethical considerations used on Earth and the examination of management options and governmental mechanisms useful for establishing an environmental stewardship framework that incorporates both scientific input and enforcement. Scientists need to undertake public dialogue to communicate widely about these future policy deliberations and to ensure public involvement in decision making. A number of incremental steps have been taken since the workshop to implement some of these recommendations.

  abstract = {Anaerobic oxidation of ammonium (anammox) is an important process in the marine N cycle. It has been estimated to contribute up to 50\% of N loss from the ocean and is especially prevalent within the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We studied the presence and distribution of anammox in the extended OMZ of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) using ladderane fatty acids (FAs), specific biomarkers for anammox bacteria. The validity of ladderane FAs as a proxy for anammox bacteria was demonstrated by their excellent correspondence with anammox 16S rRNA functional gene abundances and their expression and intact polar ladderane lipid concentrations in suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the Arabian Sea. In the ETNP, SPM was collected from various water depths at four stations along a northwest to southeast cruise transect and ladderane FAs were analysed at each station. In all SPM samples where ladderanes were detected, C18 ladderane FAs were on average fivefold more abundant than C20 ladderane FAs. Maximum ladderane FA concentrations (1.1–2.3 ng lÀ1) were recorded at 400–600 m, often corresponding to the depth of the secondary nitrite maximum. At one of the four stations, a second maximum in concentration was noted at a shallower depth (85 m), coinciding with higher nitrite availability at this depth. This suggests that nitrite, along with oxygen, may be a limiting factor for anammox activity in the ETNP. Anammox lipids were abundant within the OMZ at all stations and concentrations were comparable to those in other OMZs, suggesting that anammox may be responsible for a significant loss of N from the OMZ of the ETNP.},

Psychrophiles and psychrotrophs are both capable of growing at or close to zero, but the optimum and upper temperature limits for growth are lower for psychrophiles compared with psychrotrophs. Psychrophiles are more often isolated from permanently cold habitats, whereas psychrotrophs tend to dominate those environments that undergo thermal fluctuations. The molecular basis of psychrophily is reviewed in terms of biochemical mechanisms. The lower growth temperature limit is fixed by the freezing properties of dilute aqueous solutions inside and outside the cell. In contrast, the ability of psychrophiles and psychrotrophs to grow at low, but not moderate, temperatures depends on adaptive changes in cellular proteins and lipids. Changes in proteins are genotypic, and are related to the properties of enzymes and translation systems, whereas changes in lipids are genotypic or phenotypic and are important in regulating membrane fluidity and permeability. The ability to adapt their solute uptake systems through membrane lipid modulation may distinguish psychrophiles from psychrotrophs. The upper growth temperature limit can result from the inactivation of a single enzyme type or system, including protein synthesis or energy generation.},

Eight years (from 2003 to 2010) of data of SCIAMACHY, a hyper-spectral satellite sensor on-board ENVISAT, were processed by the PhytoDOAS method to monitor the biomass of coccolithophores in three selected regions. These regions are characterized by frequent occurrence of large coccolithophore blooms. The retrieval results, shown as monthly mean time series, were compared to related satellite products, including the total surface phytoplankton, i.e. total chlorophyll a (from GlobColour merged data) and the particulate inorganic carbon (from MODIS-Aqua). The inter-annual variations of the phytoplankton bloom cycles and their maximum monthly mean values have been compared in the three selected regions to the variations of the geophysical parameters: sea-surface temperature (SST), mixed-layer depth (MLD) and surface wind-speed, which are known to affect phytoplankton dynamics. For each region, the anomalies and linear trends of the monitored parameters over the period of this study have been computed. The patterns of total phytoplankton biomass and specific dynamics of coccolithophore chlorophyll a in the selected regions are discussed in relation to other studies. The PhytoDOAS results are consistent with the two other ocean color products and support the reported dependencies of coccolithophore biomass dynamics on the compared geophysical variables. This suggests that PhytoDOAS is a valid method for retrieving coccolithophore biomass and for monitoring its bloom developments in the global oceans. Future applications of time series studies using the PhytoDOAS data set are proposed, also using the new upcoming generations of hyper-spectral satellite sensors with improved spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a common behavior adopted by zooplankton species. DVM is a prominent adaptation for avoiding visual predation during daylight hours and still being able to feed on surface phytoplankton blooms during night. Here, we report on a DVM study using a Video Plankton Recorder (VPR), a tool that allows mapping of vertical zooplankton distributions with a far greater spatial resolution than conventional zooplankton nets. The study took place over a full day–night cycle in Disko Bay, Greenland, during the peak of the phytoplankton spring bloom. The sampling revealed a large abundance of copepods performing DVM (up during night and down during day). Migration behavior was expressed differently among the abundant groups with either a strong DVM (euphausiids), an absence of DVM (i.e.,~permanently deep; ostracods) or a marked DVM, driven by strong surface avoidance during the day and more variable depth preferences at night (Calanus spp.). The precise individual depth position provided by the VPR allowed us to conclude that the escape from surface waters during daytime reduces feeding opportunities but also lowers the risk of predation (by reducing the light exposure) and thereby is likely to influence both state (hunger, weight and stage) and survival. The results suggest that the copepods select day and night time habitats with similar light levels (\textasciitilde 10−9~μmol photon~s−1~m−2). Furthermore, Calanus spp.~displayed state-dependent behavior, with DVM most apparent for smaller individuals, and a deeper residence depth for the larger individuals.},

  abstract = {A high-sensitivity cobalt speciation method was developed and applied to a profile in the North Atlantic. Method development included examining the redox chemistry of the analytical system and calibrating the electroactive cobalt ligand dimethylglyoxime (DMG) using EDTA as a model ligand. The method was applied to a depth profile at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Station (BATS) during a September 1999 cruise. Total dissolved cobalt, measured using adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (ACSV) on ultraviolet light irradiated samples, revealed a nutrient-like profile for cobalt. Co speciation, measured using CLE–ACSV (competitive ligand exchange), showed a cobalt binding ligand concentration that was similar to that of total cobalt throughout the profile. An excess of ligand was observed in the chlorophyll maximum where Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus numbers were highest. A conditional stability constant for CoHDMG2 was measured to be logKCoHDMG2cond=11.5±0.3 at pH 8.0. A pH dependence for KCoHDMG2cond was observed and is consistent with model calculations based on the protonation constants for H2DMG. The conditional stability constant for CoL was determined to be logKCoLcond=16.3±0.9 and total ligand concentrations varied from 9 to 83 pM as calculated by a one-ligand non-linear fit using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. Alternate interpretations of the data are discussed, including the possibility for an underestimation of ligand concentrations and stability constants caused by the existence of Co(III) ligands, and kinetic and thermodynamic competition for natural ligands by Ni and Co(II).},

  abstract = {Summary We investigated the trafficking of Burkholderia cenocepacia, an opportunistic respiratory pathogen of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF), in immortalized CF airway epithelial cells in vitro. Our results indicate that bacteria enter cells in a process involving actin rearrangement. Whereas both live and heat-killed bacteria reside transiently in early endosomes, only live bacteria escape from late endosomes to colocalize in vesicles positive for lysosomal membrane marker LAMP1, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane marker calnexin, and autophagosome marker monodansylcadavarine (MDC). Twenty-four hours after infection, microcolonies of live bacteria were observed in the perinuclear area colocalizing with calnexin. In contrast, after ingestion, dead bacteria colocalized with late endosome marker Rab7, and lysosome markers LAMP1 and cathepsin D, but not with calnexin or MDC. Six to eight hours after ingestion of dead bacteria, degraded bacterial particles were observed in the cytoplasm and in vesicles positive for cathepsin D. These results indicate that live B. cenocepacia gain entry into human CF airway cells by endocytosis, escape from late endosomes to enter autophagosomes that fail to fuse with mature lysosomes, and undergo replication in the ER. This survival and replication strategy may contribute to the capacity of B. cenocepacia to persist in the lungs of infected CF patients.},

  abstract = {A seven-year oceanographic time series in NW Mediterranean surface waters was combined with pyrosequencing of ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and ribosomal RNA gene copies (16S rDNA) to examine the environmental controls on SAR11 ecotype dynamics and potential activity. SAR11 diversity exhibited pronounced seasonal cycles remarkably similar to total bacterial diversity. The timing of diversity maxima was similar across narrow and broad phylogenetic clades and strongly associated with deep winter mixing. Diversity minima were associated with periods of stratification that were low in nutrients and phytoplankton biomass and characterised by intense phosphate limitation (turnover time{$<$}5 h). We propose a conceptual framework in which physical mixing of the water column periodically resets SAR11 communities to a high diversity state and the seasonal evolution of phosphate limitation competitively excludes deeper-dwelling ecotypes to promote low diversity states dominated ({$>$}80\%) by SAR11 Ia. A partial least squares (PLS) regression model was developed that could reliably predict sequence abundances of SAR11 ecotypes (Q2=0.70) from measured environmental variables, of which mixed layer depth was quantitatively the most important. Comparison of clade-level SAR11 rRNA:rDNA signals with leucine incorporation enabled us to partially validate the use of these ratios as an in-situ activity measure. However, temporal trends in the activity of SAR11 ecotypes and their relationship to environmental variables were unclear. The strong and predictable temporal patterns observed in SAR11 sequence abundance was not linked to metabolic activity of different ecotypes at the phylogenetic and temporal resolution of our study.},

Currently lacking, however, is a sensitive, quick, and quantitative measurement of activity in these single cells. We tested the applicability of copper (I)-catalyzed cycloaddition, or “click”, chemistry to observe and estimate single-cell protein synthesis activity in natural assemblages and isolates of heterotrophic marine bacteria. Incorporation rates of the non-canonical methionine bioortholog L-homopropargylglycine (HPG) were quantified within individual cells by measuring fluorescence of alkyne-conjugated Alexa Fluor® 488 using epifluorescence microscopy. The method’s high sensitivity, along with a conversion factor derived from two Alteromonas spp. Isolates, revealed a broad range of cell-specific protein synthesis within natural microbial populations. Comparison with 35S-methionine microautoradiography showed that a large fraction of the natural marine bacterial assemblage (15-100\%), previously considered inactive by autoradiography, were actively synthesizing protein. Data pooled from a large number of samples showed that cell-specific activity scaled logarithmically with cell volume. Assemblage activity distributions of each sample were fit to power-law functions, providing an illustrative and quantitative comparison of assemblages that demonstrate individual protein synthesis rates were commonly partitioned between cells in low- and high-metabolic states in our samples. The HPG method offers a simple potential approach to link individual cell physiology to the ecology and biogeochemistry of bacterial (micro)environments in the ocean.},

Results were related to water column observations of nutrient distribution and vertical diffusive flux as well as colony abundance of Trichodesmium obtained with an Underwater Vision Profiler (UVP5). The thickness and depth of the nitracline and phosphocline proved to be significant predictors of zooplankton stable N isotope values. Atmospheric N input was highest (61\% of total N) in the strongly stratified and oligotrophic region between 3 and 7°N, which featured very high depth-integrated Trichodesmium abundance (up to 9.4×104 colonies m-2), strong thermohaline stratification and low zooplankton δ15N (\textasciitilde 2‰). Relative atmospheric N input was lowest south of the equatorial upwelling between 3 and 5°S (27\%). Values in the Guinea Dome region and north of Cape Verde ranged between 45 and 50\%, respectively. The microstructure-derived estimate of the vertical diffusive N flux in the equatorial region was about one order of magnitude higher than in any other area (approximately 8 mmol m-2 d 1). At the same time, this region received considerable atmospheric N input (35\% of total). In general, zooplankton δ15N and Trichodesmium abundance were closely correlated, indicating that N fixation is the major source of atmospheric N input. Although Trichodesmium is not the only N fixing organism, its abundance can be used with high confidence to estimate the relative atmospheric N input in the tropical Atlantic (r2 = 0.95). Estimates of absolute N fixation rates are two- to tenfold higher than incubation-derived rates reported for the same regions. Our approach integrates over large spatial and temporal scales and also quantifies fixed N released as dissolved inorganic and organic N. In a global analysis, it may thus help to close the gap in oceanic N budgets.},

Relative abundances of bacteria and nanoplanktonic protozoa (HNAN, primarily heterotrophic flagellates) are similar in marine and freshwater environments, which suggests analogous trophic relationships. Ranges of microbe abundances in marine and fresh waters overlap, and seasonal changes in abundances within an ecosystem are often as great as differences in abundances between freshwater and marine systems of similar productivities. Densities of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoplankton, therefore, are strongly related to the degree of eutrophication, and not salt per se. Data from the literature is compiled to demonstrate a remarkably consistent numerical relationship (ca 1000 bacteria: 1 HNAN) between bacterioplankton and HNAN from the euphotic zones of a variety of marine and freshwater systems. Based on the results of a simple food web model involving bacterial growth, bacterial removal by HNAN, predation on HNAN, and the observed relationships between bacterial and HNAN abundances in natural ecosystems, it is possible to demonstrate that bottom-up control (food supply) is more important in regulating bacterial abundances in oligotrophic environments while top-down control (predation) is more important in eutrophic environments.},

  abstract = {A series of cruises was carried out in the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) region of Chesapeake Bay in 1996 to examine physical and biological variability and dynamics. A large flood event in late January shifted the salinity structure of the upper Bay towards that of a salt wedge, but most of the massive sediment load delivered by the Susquehanna River appeared to bypass the ETM zone. In contrast, suspended sediments delivered during a flood event in late October were trapped very efficiently in the ETM. The difference in sediment trapping appeared to be due to increases in particle settling speed from January to October, suggesting that the fate of sediments delivered during large events may depend on the season in which they occur. The ETM roughly tracked the limit of salt (defined as the intersection of the 1 psu isohaline with the bottom) throughout the year, but it was often separated significantly from the limit of salt with the direction of separation unrelated to the phase of the tide. This was due to a lag of ETM sediment resuspension and transport behind rapid meteorologically induced or river flow induced motion of the salt limit. Examination of detailed time series of salt, suspended sediment, and velocity collected near the limit of salt, combined with other indications, led to the conclusion that the convergence of the estuarine circulation at the limit of salt is not the primary mechanism of particle trapping in the Chesapeake Bay ETM. This convergence and its associated salinity structure contribute to strong tidal asymmetries in sediment resuspension and transport that collect and maintain a resuspendable pool of rapidly settling particles near the salt limit. Without tidal resuspension and transport, the ETM would either not exist or be greatly weakened. In spite of this repeated resuspension, sedimentation is the ultimate fate of most terrigenous material delivered to the Chesapeake Bay ETM. Sedimentation rates in the ETM channel are at least an order of magnitude greater than on the adjacent shoals, probably due to focusing mechanisms that are poorly understood.},

Despite the computational cost on application to deeply sequenced complex metagenomes (e.g., soil), covarying patterns of contig coverage across multiple datasets significantly improves the binning process. We also discuss and compare current genome validation methods and reveal how these methods tackle the problem of chimeric genome bins i.e., sequences from multiple species.

Here we report strong and selective responses of phytoplankton communities to varying low levels (5–87 pM) of dissolved B12 in several coastal embayments. The ecological importance of this vitamin is inferred from observed declines in dissolved B12 levels as field populations of large ({$>$}5 μm) phytoplankton increased. In contrast, biomass of small ({$<$}5 μm) phytoplankton varied independently of B12 concentrations. These observations were corroborated by field-based nutrient amendment experiments, in which B12 additions stimulated growth of large phytoplankton taxa 6-fold over unamended controls. In contrast, small taxa ({$<$}5 μm) were largely unaffected. This study provides the first evidence of vitamin B12's influence on phytoplankton field population dynamics based on direct chemical measurements of cobalamin, and implicates B12 as an important organic regulator of photoautotrophic fertility in marine systems.},

  abstract = {The soluble B vitamins (B-1, B-7, and B-12) have long been recognized as playing a central metabolic role in marine phytoplankton and bacteria; however, the importance of these organic external metabolites in marine ecology has been largely disregarded, as most research has focused on inorganic nutrients and trace metals. Using recently available genomic data combined with culture-based surveys of vitamin auxotrophy (i.e., vitamin requirements), we show that this auxotrophy is widespread in the marine environment and occurs in both autotrophs and heterotrophs residing in oligotrophic and eutrophic environments. Our analysis shows that vitamins originate from the activities of some bacteria and algae and that taxonomic changes observed in marine phytoplankton communities could be the result of their specific vitamin requirements and/or vitamin availability. Dissolved vitamin concentration measurements show that large areas of the world ocean are devoid of B vitamins, suggesting that vitamin limitation could be important for the efficiency of carbon and nitrogen fixation in those regions.},

The bacterial community was analyzed and correlated with phytoplankton community data and abiotic parameters. The community structure was analyzed by ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) and by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes followed by DNA sequence analysis. The linkage of abiotic and biotic environmental factors and bacterial community as well as phylotypes (sequenced DGGE bands) was analyzed by the ordination technique of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Generally, an influence of temperature and phytoplankton on the bacterial community during the sampling period was observed. Additionally, multivariate analysis by factors revealed an influence on specific bacterial phylotypes of these factors. Overall, results indicate that changes in the bacterial community were caused not only by abiotic factors but also by the phytoplankton community.},

The authors have developed an exceptionally lucid yet detailed discussion of the major biogeochemical cycles in the oceans, culminating in a quantitative examination of climate change and the contemporary carbon cycle. The book is a tour de force that should be incorporated into all marine chemistry and biogeochemistry courses."--Paul Falkowski, Rutgers University"Global ocean research projects during the past two decades have resulted in explosive growth in our knowledge of ocean biogeochemistry. Sarmiento and Gruber's book crystallizes this knowledge into a systematic quantitative treatise. For many years to come, this observation--and equation-filled volume will serve as a window into the literature on many subjects, a textbook for our classes, and a reference book on our desks. Studied carefully, it could teach chemical, biological, and physical oceanographers to speak a common language."--Edward A. Boyle, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"With this book, ocean biogeochemistry--the fascinating science behind the cycling of elements in the sea, and their transformation by biological, chemical, and physical properties--has finally found its theoretical underpinning. The two authors, both world experts, have succeeded in bringing together in a comprehensive and unified way the mass of information from the different scientific disciplines as well as the numerous observations obtained over the last few decades. This book will serve as the ultimate reference, both for students and the advanced research scientist, for many years to come."--Martin Heimann, Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry"The Sarmiento and Gruber text is a very impressive achievement, providing a readable yet advanced treatise on ocean biogeochemistry and providing the best available summary of the advances of the last few decades. The emphasis on dynamics is highly relevant for studies of global change, while the emphasis on problem solving has yielded an invaluable teaching reference."--Ralph Keeling, Scripps Institution of OceanographySarmiento and Gruber have cleverly found the middle ground between the "educated layman" approach so often typified in "soft sciences" and the stultifying rigor that cloaks the conceptual simplicity underlying many of the foundations of the field.

The bacterial and archaeal communities associated with a phytoplankton bloom in Amazon River Plume waters at the outer continental shelf in June 2010 harbored ∼1.0 × 1013 genes and 4.7 × 1011 transcripts per liter that mapped to several thousand microbial genomes. Genomes from free-living cells were more abundant than those from particle-associated cells, and they generated more transcripts per liter for carbon fixation, heterotrophy, nitrogen and phosphorus uptake, and iron acquisition, although they had lower expression ratios (transcripts⋅gene−1) overall. Genomes from particle-associated cells contributed more transcripts for sulfur cycling, aromatic compound degradation, and the synthesis of biologically essential vitamins, with an overall twofold up-regulation of expression compared with free-living cells. Quantitatively, gene regulation differences were more important than genome abundance differences in explaining why microenvironment transcriptomes differed. Taxa contributing genomes to both free-living and particle-associated communities had up to 65\% of their expressed genes regulated differently between the two, quantifying the extent of transcriptional plasticity in marine microbes in situ. In response to patchiness in carbon, nutrients, and light at the micrometer scale, Amazon Plume microbes regulated the expression of genes relevant to biogeochemical processes at the ecosystem scale.},

  abstract = {Microbial capacity to metabolize arsenic is ancient, arising in response to its pervasive presence in the environment, which was largely in the form of As(III) in the early anoxic ocean. Many biological arsenic transformations are aimed at mitigating toxicity; however, some microorganisms can respire compounds of this redox-sensitive element to reap energetic gains. In several modern anoxic marine systems concentrations of As(V) are higher relative to As(III) than what would be expected from the thermodynamic equilibrium, but the mechanism for this discrepancy has remained unknown. Here we present evidence of a complete respiratory arsenic cycle, consisting of dissimilatory As(V) reduction and chemoautotrophic As(III) oxidation, in the pelagic ocean. We identified the presence of genes encoding both subunits of the respiratory arsenite oxidase AioA and the dissimilatory arsenate reductase ArrA in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) oxygen-deficient zone (ODZ). The presence of the dissimilatory arsenate reductase gene arrA was enriched on large particles ({$>$}30 um), similar to the forward bacterial dsrA gene of sulfate-reducing bacteria, which is involved in the cryptic cycling of sulfur in ODZs. Arsenic respiratory genes were expressed in metatranscriptomic libraries from the ETNP and the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) ODZ, indicating arsenotrophy is a metabolic pathway actively utilized in anoxic marine water columns. Together these results suggest arsenic-based metabolisms support organic matter production and impact nitrogen biogeochemical cycling in modern oceans. In early anoxic oceans, especially during periods of high marine arsenic concentrations, they may have played a much larger role.},

Significant levels of pollution indicator organisms were detected at all of the stations sampled. Highest counts were observed in samples collected at the confluence of the Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay. The indicator organisms examined were observed to be quantitatively distributed independently of temperature and salinity. Counts were not found to be correlated with concentration of suspended sediment. However, significant proportions of both the total viable bacteria (53\%) and fecal indicator organisms ({$>$}80\%) were directly associated with suspended sediments. Correlation coefficients (r) for the indicator organisms examined in this study ranged from r = 0.80 to r = 0.99 for bottom water and suspended sediment, respectively. Prolonged survival of fecal streptococci in most of the sediment samples was observed, with concomitant reduction of the correlation coefficient from r = 0.99, fecal streptococci to total coliforms in water, to r = 0.01, fecal streptococci to fecal coliforms in sediments. The results of this study compared favorably with fecal coliforms: fecal streptococci ratios for the various sample types.

  abstract = {Insects and spiders comprise more than two-thirds of the Earth's total species diversity. There is wide concern, however, that the global diversity of arthropods may be declining even more rapidly than the diversity of vertebrates and plants. For adequate conservation planning, ecologists need to understand the driving factors for arthropod communities and devise methods that provide reliable predictions when resources do not permit exhaustive ground surveys. Which factor most successfully predicts arthropod community structure is still a matter of debate, however. The purpose of this study was to identify the factor best predicting arthropod assemblage composition. We investigated the species composition of seven functionally different arthropod groups (epigeic spiders, grasshoppers, ground beetles, weevils, hoppers, hoverflies, and bees) at 47 sites in The Netherlands comprising a range of seminatural grassland types and one heathland type. We then compared the actual arthropod composition with predictions based on plant species composition, vegetation structure, environmental data, flower richness, and landscape composition. For this we used the recently published method of predictive co-correspondence analysis, and a predictive variant of canonical correspondence analysis, depending on the type of predictor data. Our results demonstrate that local plant species composition is the most effective predictor of arthropod assemblage composition, for all investigated groups. In predicting arthropod assemblages, plant community composition consistently outperforms both vegetation structure and environmental conditions (even when the two are combined), and also performs better than the surrounding landscape. These results run against a common expectation of vegetation structure as the decisive factor. Such expectations, however, have always been biased by the fact that until recently no methods existed that could use an entire (plant) species composition in the explanatory role. Although more recent experimental diversity work has reawakened interest in the role of plant species, these studies still have not used (or have not been able to use) entire species compositions. They only consider diversity measures, both for plant and insect assemblages, which may obscure relationships. The present study demonstrates that the species compositions of insect and plant communities are clearly linked.},

  abstract = {Bathing water compliant with bathing water legislation may nevertheless contain pathogens to such a level that they pose unacceptable health risks for swimmers. Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) can provide a proper basis for protective measures, but the required data on swimmer exposure are currently limited or lacking. The objective of this study was to collect exposure data for swimmers in fresh water, seawater and swimming pools, i.e. volume of water swallowed and frequency and duration of swimming events. The study related to swimming in 2007, but since the summer of 2007 was wet and this might have biased the results regarding surface water exposure, the study was repeated relating to swimming in 2009, which had a dry and sunny summer. Exposure data were collected through questionnaires administered to approximately 19 000 persons representing the general Dutch population. Questionnaires were completed by 8000 adults of whom 1924 additionally answered the questions for their eldest child ({$<$}15 years). The collected data did not differ significantly between 2007 and 2009. The frequency of swimming and the duration of swimming were different for men, women and children and between water types. Differences between men and women were small, but children behaved differently: they swam more often, stayed in the water longer, submerged their heads more often and swallowed more water. Swimming pools were visited most frequently (on average 13–24 times/year) with longest duration of swimming (on average 67–81~min). On average, fresh and seawater sites were visited 6–8 times/year and visits lasted 41–79~min. Dependent on the water type, men swallowed on average 27–34~ml per swimming event, women 18–23~ml, and children 31–51~ml. Data on exposure of swimmers to recreational waters could be obtained by using a questionnaire approach in combination with a test to measure mouthfuls of water for transformation of categorical data to numerical data of swallowed volumes of water. Previous assumptions on swimmer exposure were replaced with estimates of exposure parameters, thus reducing uncertainty in assessing the risk of infection with waterborne pathogens and enabling identification of risk groups. QMRA for Cryptosporidium and Giardia was demonstrated based on data from previous studies on the occurrence of these pathogens in recreational lakes and a swimming pool.},

Phytoplankton composition was determined from pigment analysis with subsequent calculations of group contributions to total chlorophyll a (Chl a) using CHEMTAX and, in addition, by examination in the microscope. The different plankton communities detected reflected the different water masses along a transect from Cape Town, South Africa, to Broome, Australia. The first station was influenced by the Agulhas Current with a very deep mixed surface layer. Based on pigment analysis this station was dominated by haptophytes, pelagophytes, cyanobacteria, and prasinophytes. Sub-Antarctic waters of the Southern Ocean were encountered at the next station, where new nutrients were intruded to the surface layer and the total Chl a concentration reached high concentrations of 1.7~[mu]g~Chl~a~L-1 with increased proportions of diatoms and dinoflagellates. The third station was also influenced by Southern Ocean waters, but located in a transition area on the boundary to subtropical water. Prochlorophytes appeared in the samples and Chl a was low, i.e., 0.3~[mu]g~L-1 in the surface with prevalence of haptophytes, pelagophytes, and cyanobacteria. The next two stations were located in the subtropical gyre with little mixing and general oligotrophic conditions where prochlorophytes, haptophytes and pelagophytes dominated. The last two stations were located in tropical waters influenced by down-welling of the Leeuwin Current and particularly prochlorophytes dominated at these two stations, but also pelagophytes, haptophytes and cyanobacteria were abundant. Haptophytes Type 6 (sensu Zapata et al., 2004), most likely Emiliania huxleyi, and pelagophytes were the dominating eucaryotes in the southern Indian Ocean. Prochlorophytes dominated in the subtrophic and oligotrophic eastern Indian Ocean where Chl a was low, i.e., 0.043-0.086~[mu]g total Chl~a~L-1 in the surface, and up to 0.4~[mu]g~Chl~a~L-1 at deep Chl a maximum. From the pigment analyses it was found that the dinoflagellates of unknown trophy enumerated in the microscope at the oligotrophic stations were possibly heterotrophic or mixotrophic. Presence of zeaxanthin containing heterotrophic bacteria may have increased the abundance of cyanobacteria determined by CHEMTAX.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Ocean models predict a decline in the dissolved oxygen inventory of the global ocean of one to seven per cent by the year 2100, caused by a combination of a warming-induced decline in oxygen solubility and reduced ventilation of the deep ocean(1,2). It is thought that such a decline in the oceanic oxygen content could affect ocean nutrient cycles and the marine habitat, with potentially detrimental consequences for fisheries and coastal economies(3-6). Regional observational data indicate a continuous decrease in oceanic dissolved oxygen concentrations in most regions of the global ocean(1,7-10), with an increase reported in a few limited areas, varying by study(1,10). Prior work attempting to resolve variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations at the global scale reported a global oxygen loss of 550 +/- 130 teramoles (10(12) mol) per decade between 100 and 1,000 metres depth based on a comparison of data from the 1970s and 1990s(10). Here we provide a quantitative assessment of the entire ocean oxygen inventory by analysing dissolved oxygen and supporting data for the complete oceanic water column over the past 50 years. We find that the global oceanic oxygen content of 227.4 +/- 1.1 petamoles (10(15) mol) has decreased by more than two per cent (4.8 +/- 2.1 petamoles) since 1960, with large variations in oxygen loss in different ocean basins and at different depths. We suggest that changes in the upper water column are mostly due to a warming-induced decrease in solubility and biological consumption. Changes in the deeper ocean may have their origin in basin-scale multi-decadal variability, oceanic overturning slow-down and a potential increase in biological consumption(11,12).},

  abstract = {A new model of the marine ecosystem coupled into a global Earth System Climate Model suitable for long-term (multimillennial timescale) simulations is presented. The model is based on nitrate as the sole limiting nutrient. Prognostic equations for nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus are solved online in the three-dimensional ocean circulation model component. Experiments with different parameterizations of vertical mixing, including a scheme of tidally driven mixing, changes in buoyancy forcing in the Southern Ocean, different particle sinking velocities, and the inclusion of dissolved organic matter are performed, and the results are compared with observations. The results reemphasize the roles of Southern Ocean freshwater forcing and diapycnal mixing in the low-latitude pycnocline in setting the global deep water circulation and properties. The influence of high mixing in the Southern Ocean as inferred from observations is much more limited. The deep water circulation also has a strong influence on the marine ecosystem and nutrient distributions. We demonstrate that larger values of vertical diffusion lead to a shallower nutricline due to increased upwelling. Export production and nutrient distributions respond sensitively to changes in mixing and to the ratio of particle sinking to remineralization in the upper ocean. The best fits to global measurements of temperature, salinity, deep ocean radiocarbon, mixed layer depth, nutrients, and chlorophyll are obtained for values of vertical mixing in the pycnocline of around 0.2–0.3 × 10−4 m2/s and for e-folding depth for particle remineralization of 100–200 m. A simple parameterization of dissolved organic matter dynamics increases primary production and nutrient concentrations in the upper ocean and improves chlorophyll distributions in the subtropical gyres but has no discernible influence on particulate export fluxes. Remaining model deficiencies are identified, and strategies for future model improvement are outlined.},

A total of 1525 data points assimilated from 110 studies were included and grouped using the biogeographic subsets defined by Longhurst et al. [(1995) An estimate of global primary production in the ocean from satellite radiometer data. J. Plankton Res., 17, 1245–1271]. Total median phytoplankton growth rates in each of the subsets varied between 0.15 (Polar Southern) and 0.83 day−1 (Trades Atlantic), with the corresponding microzooplankton grazing rates ranging between 0.07 (Polar Southern) and 0.48 day−1 (Trades Indian). The median percentage of primary production (PP) grazed by microzooplankton was relatively constant among the regions and ranged from 49 to 77\%, with the lowest percentage found in the Westerlies Southern and the highest in the Coastal Indian. Despite strong evidence that microzooplankton grazing impacts were highly variable, no global drivers for this variability (temperature, chlorophyll concentration) were identified in the analysis. As a global carbon budget, the overall consumption of phytoplankton for all regions was 31.3 Gt C year−1, which accounted for 62.4\% of the total PP grazed daily. The amount of carbon ingested by micro- and mesozooplankton varied proportionally to the PP and the consumption was five times higher for micro- than for mesozooplankton. As concluding remarks of the study, we present some suggestions that may improve the quality of the data obtained with the dilution technique.},

  abstract = {Diel vertically migrating zooplankton can contribute significantly to dissolved carbon and nutrient export by respiring and excreting surface-ingested particulate organic matter below the mixed layer. Active export of particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) due to defecation at depth has rarely been considered in export budgets. We measured the gut passage time (GPT) of common migrant species at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site, using the gut fluorescence method, to determine whether GPT is slow enough to allow active export of POC and PON to depth. Mean GPT for the copepods Pleuromamma xiphias and Euchirella messinensis was 191 and 114 min, respectively, and for the euphausiids Thysanopoda aequalis and Euphausia brevis (analyzed together) was 41 min, exceeding previously reported GPT for nonmigrating zooplankton by a factor of 6. Between 18 and 81\% of the initial gut pigment was retained in zooplankton guts upon descent below a mixed layer of 150 m. By comparing pigment ingestion rates (gut fluorescence technique) with total ingestion rates (CHN analysis of fecal material), we estimated that 71 to 85\% of the migrant diet originated from non-plant material, which we included in our estimates of active POC/PON export. We applied the mean weight-specific active POC/PON export rate for the species examined to the total migratory zooplankton biomass using data from the BATS zooplankton time-series. Mean active POC (PON) flux at BATS was 0.94 mg C m–2 d–1 (0.18 mg N m–2 d–1) and the maximum was 5.27 mg C m–2 d–1 (1.02 mg N m–2 d–1), corresponding to a mean of 3\% (4\%) and a maximum of 18\% (20\%) of the mean gravitational POC (PON) flux measured by sediment traps at 150 m. Migrants also contributed significantly to passive flux via production of sinking fecal pellets during the night in surface waters. This passive flux exceeded active POC flux by \textasciitilde 10-fold. Freshly released feces by migrators at depth could be a valuable food source for mesopelagic organisms, in contrast to feces produced in surface waters which decompose while settling through the water column.},

A total of 856 partial length 18S rDNA protistan sequences from the six clone libraries were analyzed to characterize diversity present at each depth. The sequences were grouped into a total of 259 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that were inferred using an automated OTU calling program that formed OTUs with approximately species-level distinction (95\% sequence similarity). Most OTUs (194 out of 259) were observed at only one specific depth, and only two were present in clone libraries from all depths. OTUs were obtained from 21 major protistan taxonomic groups determined by their closest BLAST matches to identified protists in the NCBI database. Approximately 74\% of the detected OTUs belonged to the Chromalveolates, with Group II alveolates making up the largest single group. Protistan assemblages at euphotic depths (1.5, 20 and 42 m) were characterized by the presence of clades that contained phototrophic species (stramenopiles, chlorophytes and haptophytes) as well as consumers (especially ciliates). Assemblages in the lower water column (150, 500 and 800 m) were distinct from communities at shallow depths because of strong contributions from taxa belonging to euglenozoans, acantharians, polycystines and Taxopodida (Sticholonche spp. and close relatives). Species richness (Chao I estimate) and diversity (Shannon index) were highest within the euphotic zone and at 150 m, and lowest for protistan assemblages located in the oxygen minimum zone (500 and 880 m). Multivariate analyses (Bray–Curtis coefficient) confirmed that protistan assemblage composition differed significantly when samples were grouped into shallow (≤150 m) and deep water assemblages (≥150 m).},

Concentrations of particulate and dissolved domoic acid (pDA and dDA) differed significantly among exponential phase and MS formation under simulated near surface conditions (16°C/12:12-dark:light cycle) and also differed compared to subsequent particle decomposition at 4°C in the dark, mimicking conditions in deeper waters. Particulate DA was first detected at the onset of exponential growth, reached maximum levels associated with MS aggregates (1.21±0.24ngmL−1) and declined at an average loss rate of ∼1.2\%pDAday−1 during particle decomposition. Dissolved DA concentrations increased throughout the experiment and reached a maximum of ∼20ngmL−1 at final sampling on day 88. The succession by P. australis from active growth to aggregation resulted in increasing MS toxicity and based on DA loading of particles and known in situ sinking speeds, a significant amount of toxin could have easily reached the deeper ocean or seafloor. MS formation was further associated with significant dDA accumulation at a ratio of pDA: dDA: cumulative dDA of approximately 1:10:100. Overall, this study confirms that MS functions as a major vector for toxin flux to depth, that Pseudo-nitzschia-derived aggregates should be considered ‘toxic snow’ for MS-associated organisms, and that effects of MS toxicity on interactions with aggregate-associated microbes and zooplankton consumers warrant further consideration.},

  abstract = {The feeding preferences of three common diel vertically migrating zooplankton were investigated from December 1999 to October 2000 at the U.S. JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study (BATS) station in the Sargasso Sea. Gut content analysis of the copepods Pleuromamma xiphias (Giesbrecht) and Euchirella messinensis (Claus) and of the euphausiid Thysanopoda aequalis (Hansen) indicated that all three species fed on a wide variety of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detrital material. Diet changes generally reflected seasonal trends in phytoplankton community structure. However, species-specific feeding preferences and differences in feeding selectivity among the three species were evident, and in general agreement with feeding habits predicted from the analysis of mouthpart morphology. The euphausiid T. aequalis fed equally on more different food types compared to both copepod species. The copepod P. xiphias consumed a diverse assemblage of phytoplankton from late winter through the summer (78–93\% of gut items, by number, were phytoplankton) and based its diet more strongly on carnivorous feeding in autumn and early winter (31\% and 61\% of gut items were phytoplankton, respectively). E. messinensis showed the greatest feeding specialization, with a strong preference for pennate diatoms in winter and spring and for coccolithophorids during late summer and fall (constituting 67–93\% of gut items by number). All three species consumed diatoms more than other phytoplankton taxa, even though diatoms form only a small fraction of the phytoplankton biomass in the Sargasso Sea. Although the majority of gut items identified were phytoplankton cells, the relative biomass contribution of these small cells may be lower than that of zooplankton and detritus. Zooplankton on which the three species primarily preyed were protozoans and crustaceans, but also included other metazoans such as chaetognaths and cnidarians. Marine snow was also an important component of the diet in all three species, with typically {$>$}50\% and rarely {$<$}20\% of the gut content being olive-green debris. Marine snow from larvacean houses was found in the guts of all three species, while E. messinenis appeared to selectively consume marine snow aggregates enriched with bicapitate Nitzschia spp. Large cyanobacteria ({$>$}4~µm in diameter) found in guts were also likely consumed with marine snow. The species-specific differences in the diets of these three migrating species suggest that an individual species approach is important in determining how feeding habits affect the structure of pelagic food webs and carbon cycling in the sea.

Slocum Gliders have transitioned from a concept to a technology serving basic research and environmental stewardship. The long duration and low operating costs of Gliders allow them to anchor spatial time series. Large distances, over 600 kilometers, can be covered using a single set of alkaline batteries. Since the initial tests, a wide range of physical and optical sensors have been integrated into the Glider allowing measurements of temperature, salinity, depth averaged currents, surface currents, fluorescence, apparent and inherent optical properties. The ability to operate Gliders for extended periods of time are making them the central in situ technology for the evolving ocean observatories. Off shore New Jersey Gliders have occupied a cross shelf transect and has documented the annual variability in shelf wide stratification on the Mid-Atlantic Bight and the role of storms in sediment resuspension. The sustained data permits scientists to gather regional data critical to addressing if, and how, the oceans are changing. One of next major regions we will use this technology is to study the climate induced impacts on the food webs along the West Antarctic Peninsula.},

Resource managers who monitor shellfish beds need reliable information on a variety of water quality indicators at higher frequency than is possible through field monitoring programs and at a higher level of detail than current satellite products can provide. Although many factors causing degraded water quality that can impact human health are not currently discernable by traditional multispectral techniques, hyperspectral imagery offers a new opportunity to detect phytoplankton communities associated with harmful algal blooms and biotoxin production. Together with resource managers in their routine monitoring of sites around the bay from small boats, we have been exploring remotely sensed optical proxies for the detection of harmful algal blooms and sewage. Early warning by remote sensing could guide sampling and improve the efficiency of shellfish bed closures, ultimately improving health outcomes for humans and animals. An extensive network of routine sampling by Chesapeake Bay Program managers makes this is an ideal location to develop and test future satellite data products to support management decisions. Next generation hyperspectral measurements from the future Plankton Aerosol Cloud ocean Ecosystem  mission at nearly daily frequency, combined with the potential of higher spatial resolution from the Surface Biology and Geology  observing system recommended in the recent Decadal Survey, along with high frequency observations from the newly selected Geostationary Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer  Earth Venture Instrument make this a critical time for defining the needs of the aquaculture and resource management community to save lives, time, and money.},

  abstract = {Observationsof episodicsubsidenceand high organic maturity in the intracratonic Michigan basin cannot be explained by simple conductive models. Moreover, the sylvinite depositswithin the basin indicate an evaporite evolution other than a simple evapoconcentrationof standard seawater. By means of numerical simulations we have investigated whether these deviations can be attributedto periodsof freethermochemicaclonvection(TCC) of aqueousfluids within a fractured igneousrift body underlying the sediments. Since crustal rocks are known to be heterogeneousand anisotropic,we have first investigatedthe onset of TCC in an idealizeddomain, for temperature and salinity linearly increasingwith depth. The sensitivity study considersseveralheterogeneouspermeability fields, by varying the stochastic correlation lengths of the medium and by introducing anisotropy on the subgrid scale. Due to destabilization of the fluid in pockets of relatively high porosity, the onset of convectionin the heterogeneousmedia occurs at ratios of chemical to thermal buoyancy i order higher than in homogeneous media. Next we have studied the thermal, chemical, and subsidenceeffectsof the convectiveflow in and beneath the Michigan basin, for the situations before and after closurefrom the opensea. TCC explainsthe elevatedlevel of organicmaturity in the sedimentsand up to a quarter of the observedfast subsidencerates. Finally, we argue that basementinvolvement could have changedthe seawater composition, and so leads to the direct deposition of sylvinite.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested by POSTMA (1967) that the suspended particles in a turbidity maximum produced by the net non-tidal estuarine circulation should have a narrow size distribution. Particles larger than a certain size would presumably be deposited while smaller particles would be carried out of the area by the net seaward flow of the upper layer. There have been very few pertinent data to support or deny this suggestion. An intensive investigation of the Chesapeake Bay's turbidity maximum has shown that its suspended particle population is determined by the physical processes, local resuspension and the net non-tidal estuarine circulation, which combine to produce the turbid zone; and that the suspended particles have a narrow size distribution both in terms of equivalent projected diameters and Stokes' diameters or settling velocities. Determinations were made both of the number-size distributions by a photomicrographic technique and of the volume-settling velocity (“size”) distributions by a sedimentation technique. The suspended particle population of the Chesapeake Bay's turbid zone is composed of two sub-populations. One sub-population is comprised of particles with settling velocities of the same order as the vertical mixing velocities. These particles form a “natural background” of suspended sediment found throughout the water column and whose concentration and particle size distribution are very uniform over periods of weeks or months. The second sub-population consists of particles which are alternately suspended and deposited. The presence of this sub-population is made manifest by semi-tidal fluctuations of the concentration of suspended sediment in the lower layer at stations deeper than about 4 m and throughout the water column at shallower stations. The fluctuations produced by tidal “scour and fill” are accompanied by marked changes in the volume-size distribution and increase in magnitude near the bottom—the sediment source.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Recent theory suggests that viruses influence bacterial community composition by killing the winners of resource competition. We tested aspects of this theory by growing natural marine bacteria communities in seawater microcosms that had either significantly reduced or increased virus abundances and monitoring changes in the bacterial communities. Bacterial community composition was assayed by 2 whole-community fingerprinting techniques, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (TRFLP) and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), at the beginning and end of experiments to examine the effect of changes in viral abundance on bacterial community composition. Our results suggest that changes in viral abundances have mixed effects on microbial community fingerprints. Modest, but statistically significant, changes in community fingerprints were seen when most viruses were removed by filtration and bacteria subsequently grown over 5 d compared to growth at normal virus density. There were no significant differences between community fingerprints from microcosms grown with a normal versus 3-fold density of viruses over 2 d (possibly because of slow growth rates); however, significant changes occurred over time, regardless of virus abundance, suggesting that manipulation and containment alone had a strong influence on community fingerprints, which may have masked some virus effects. Also, moderate natural variation in composition between replicate microcosms made it difficult to distinguish statistically significant virus effects. Given that relatively few significant changes were apparent in community fingerprints between virus treatments at the end of our experiments, it is possible that current models of virus infection and the possible roles of viruses in controlling community composition need re-evaluation. The persistence of high viral abundance and apparent high turnover, in concert with our results, suggests that viruses and their hosts may have a more stable coexistence than is now currently thought. However, it is possible that the modest effects of viral infection observed in this short-term study could be significantly amplified over longer time-scales of weeks or months, resulting in viruses having a more substantial influence on bacterial community composition.},

AAnPB abundances are lower in most marine systems than previously reported from the Eastern Pacific and demonstrate that AAnPB abundances are more variable than previously realized. Our results do not support the notion AAnPB are more abundant in oligotrophic environments and, in fact, suggest the opposite.

Therefore, efforts have been taken to constrain the role of sediments as a source of methylmercury (MeHg) to the estuarine water column. This study employed the Gust Microcosm Erosion Core system capable of quantifying particle removal from undisturbed cores under measurable shear stress conditions to assess particulate Hg and MeHg exchange between sediments and the water column. Samples were collected from organic-rich and organic-poor sediment types from the mid- and lower Delaware Bay. It was found that bulk sediment samples from organic-rich systems overpredict total Hg and MeHg release to the water column, whereas organic-poor sediments underpredict the exchange. In general, organic-rich sediments in shallow environments have the most impact on surface particle dynamics. There is little evidence to suggest that MeHg formed in the sediments is released to the water column via particulate exchange, and therefore, nonsedimentary sources likely control MeHg levels in this estuarine water column.},

Water collected from above the salinity intrusion zone of each river was filtered, brought to a salinity of 15 ppt, and inoculated with estuarine bacteria. Bacterial production rates (8 to 26 X 105cells ml-' d-') during the initial 2 d in these experiments were within the range measured in these and other estuaries, indicating that riverine dissolved organic matter can contribute to production of estuarine bacteria. Average DON concentrations decreased by 40 to 72 \% within the 10 to 15 d time course of the experiments; the decreases in DON were accounted for by increases in microbial biomass plus remineral\textasciitilde zationto inorganic nitrogen. The time scale over which DON was utilized suggests that in estuaries with residence times on the order of weeks to months, such as Delaware Bay, river inputs of the biologically available portion of DON are first utilized within the estuary.

  abstract = {Chain formation is common among phytoplankton organisms but the underlying reasons and consequences are poorly understood. Here we show that chain formation is strongly impaired by waterborne cues from copepod grazers in the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense. Chains of Alexandrium cells exposed to copepod cues responded by splitting into single cells or shorter chains. Motion analysis revealed significantly lower swimming velocities for single cells compared with chains, with two- to fivefold higher simulated predator encounter rates for two- and four-cell chains, respectively. In addition, the few remaining two-cell chains in grazed treatments were swimming at approximately half the speed of two-cell chains in treatments without grazers, which reduced encounter rates with grazers to values similar to that of single cells. Chain length plasticity and swimming behavior constitute unique mechanisms to reduce encounters with grazers. We argue that dinoflagellates can regulate the balance between motility and predator avoidance by adjusting chain length. The high predator encounter rate for motile chains may have contributed to the low prevalence of chain formation in motile phytoplankton compared with in nonmotile phytoplankton where chain formation is more common.}

Here we describe a 3-dimensional syringe pump water sampling device that overcomes the constraints of previous 1- or 2-dimensional samplers. 3DMAPPER consists of a 1-m(3) cubic stainless-steel structure supporting three 10-by-10 arrays of 60-mL syringes with an intersample distance of 5 cm. The design ensures a high stability of syringe sampling position and an undisturbed sampling volume for mean flow velocities ranging from 5 to 180 cm s(-1). 3DMAPPER can easily be disassembled into subsections to simplify the handling of multiple samples, the syringes are easy to replace, and the sampling of multiple large volumes allows statistical treatment of multiple variables. The 300 syringes of 3DMAPPER are drained under water by increasing the ambient hydrostatic pressure using a SCUBA tank, and simultaneously and immediately filled upon relieving the inside pressure via a surface valve. 3DMAPPER is independent of a surface power supply and is deployed directly in the water to be sampled, making it versatile and appropriate for in situ deployment.},

However, examinations of microbial behavior within patchy microhabitats have been precluded by methodological limitations. We developed a microfluidic device to generate microscale resource patches at environmentally realistic spatiotemporal scales, and we examined the exploitation of these patches by marine microorganisms. We studied the foraging response of three sequential levels of the microbial food web: a phytoplankton (Dunaliella tertiolecta), a heterotrophic bacterium (Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis), and a phagotrophic protist (Neobodo designis). Population‐level chemotactic responses and single‐cell swimming behaviors were quantified. Dunaliella tertiolecta accumulated within a patch of \$\textbackslash mathrm\{NH\}\textbackslash,\^\{+\}\_\{4\}\$ , simulating a zooplankton excretion, within 1 min of its formation. Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis cells also exhibited a chemotactic response to patches of D. tertiolecta exudates within 30 s, whereas N. designis shifted swimming behavior in response to bacterial prey patches. Although they relied on different swimming strategies, all three organisms exhibited behaviors that permitted efficient and rapid exploitation of resource patches. These observations imply that microscale nutrient patchiness may subsequently trigger the sequential formation of patches of phytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria, and protozoan predators in the ocean. Enhanced uptake and predation rates driven by patch exploitation could accelerate carbon flux through the microbial loop.},

  abstract = {Disturbances act as powerful structuring forces on ecosystems. To ask whether environmental microbial communities have capacity to recover after a large disturbance event, we conducted a whole-ecosystem manipulation, during which we imposed an intense disturbance on freshwater microbial communities by artificially mixing a temperate lake during peak summer thermal stratification. We employed environmental sensors and water chemistry analyses to evaluate the physical and chemical responses of the lake, and bar-coded 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) to assess the bacterial community responses. The artificial mixing increased mean lake temperature from 14 to 20 °C for seven weeks after mixing ended, and exposed the microorganisms to very different environmental conditions, including increased hypolimnion oxygen and increased epilimnion carbon dioxide concentrations. Though overall ecosystem conditions remained altered (with hypolimnion temperatures elevated from 6 to 20 °C), bacterial communities returned to their pre-manipulation state as some environmental conditions, such as oxygen concentration, recovered. Recovery to pre-disturbance community composition and diversity was observed within 7 (epilimnion) and 11 (hypolimnion) days after mixing. Our results suggest that some microbial communities have capacity to recover after a major disturbance.},

As a result, we do not know if overarching temporal trends exist for microbial communities or if changes in microbial communities are generally predictable with time. Using microbial time series assessed via high-throughput sequencing, we conducted a meta-analysis of temporal dynamics in microbial communities, including 76 sites representing air, aquatic, soil, brewery wastewater treatment, human- and plant-associated microbial biomes. We found that temporal variability in both within- and between-community diversity was consistent among microbial communities from similar environments. Community structure changed systematically with time in less than half of the cases, and the highest rates of change were observed within ranges of 1 day to 1 month for all communities examined. Microbial communities exhibited species–time relationships (STRs), which describe the accumulation of new taxa to a community, similar to those observed previously for plant and animal communities, suggesting that STRs are remarkably consistent across a broad range of taxa. These results highlight that a continued integration of microbial ecology into the broader field of ecology will provide new insight into the temporal patterns of microbial and ‘macro’-bial communities alike.},

Aggregates in field and laboratory samples were photographed and their dimensions were determined. Particulate composition of the aggregates was characterized by the abundance of diatoms, benthic diatoms, diatom frustules, mineral grains, fecal pellets, and fungal spores. Laboratory-prepared aggregates had a significantly greater short axis, and significantly larger calculated volume than field aggregates. Particulate compositions of field aggregates were paralleled by similar changes in the laboratory product. Dry weights of known numbers of aggregates collected on three dates indicated no significant differences in calculated densities or porosities of marine snow formed in the field and in the laboratory. We suggest that this method of forming marine snow in the laboratory may provide researchers with a useful experimental tool.},

Further, in both laboratory-made and field-collected marine snow we found measurable amounts of sulfide. Sulfide was present in marine snow on 9 out of 10 sample dates and the sulfide concentration within marine snow ranged from 1.3 to 25 pm01 S 1-' On only 1 out of 10 dates was sulfide detected in the oxygenated waters surrounding the aggregates.

Vibrio illness originating from dermal contact with Vibrio laden waters or through ingestion of seafood originating from such waters can cause deleterious health effects, particularly if the strains involved are resistant to clinically important antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility among these pathogens. Surface-water samples were collected from three sites of recreational and commercial importance from July to September 2009. Samples were plated onto species-specific media and resulting V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus strains were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction assays and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the Sensititre® microbroth dilution system. Descriptive statistics, Friedman two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the data. Vibrio vulnificus (n = 120) and V. parahaemolyticus (n = 77) were isolated from all sampling sites. Most isolates were susceptible to antibiotics recommended for treating Vibrio infections, although the majority of isolates expressed intermediate resistance to chloramphenicol (78\% of V. vulnificus, 96\% of V. parahaemolyticus). Vibrio parahaemolyticus also demonstrated resistance to penicillin (68\%). Sampling location or month did not significantly impact V. parahaemolyticus resistance patterns, but V. vulnificus isolates from St. Martin's River had lower overall intermediate resistance than that of the other two sampling sites during the month of July (p = 0.0166). Antibiotics recommended to treat adult Vibrio infections were effective in suppressing bacterial growth, while some antibiotics recommended for pediatric treatment were not effective against some of the recovered isolates. To our knowledge, these are the first antimicrobial susceptibility data of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus recovered from the Chesapeake Bay. These data can serve as a baseline against which future studies can be compared to evaluate whether susceptibilities change over time.},

  abstract = {To determine if a storm event (i.e., high winds, large volumes of precipitation) could alter concentrations of Vibrio vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus in aquacultured oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and associated surface water and sediment, this study followed a sampling timeline before and after Hurricane Irene impacted the Chesapeake Bay estuary in late August 2011. Aquacultured oysters were sampled from two levels in the water column: surface (0.3 m) and near-bottom (just above the sediment). Concentrations of each Vibrio spp. and associated virulence genes were measured in oysters with a combination of realtime PCR and most probable number (MPN) enrichment methods, and in sediment and surface water with real-time PCR. While concentration shifts of each Vibrio species were apparent post-storm, statistical tests indicated no significant change in concentration for either Vibrio species by location (surface or near bottom oysters) or date sampled (oyster tissue, surface water, and sediment concentrations). V. vulnificus in oyster tissue was correlated with total suspended solids (r = 0.41, P = 0.04), and V. vulnificus in sediment was correlated with secchi depth (r = −0.93, P {$<$} 0.01), salinity (r = −0.46, P = 0.02), tidal height (r = −0.45, P = 0.03), and surface water V. vulnificus (r = 0.98, P {$<$} 0.01). V. parahaemolyticus in oyster tissue did not correlate with environmental measurements, but V. parahaemolyticus in sediment and surface water correlated with several measurements including secchi depth [r = −0.48, P = 0.02 (sediment); r = −0.97, P {$<$} 0.01 (surface water)] and tidal height [r = −0.96, P {$<$} 0.01 (sediment), r = −0.59, P {$<$} 0.01 (surface water)]. The concentrations of Vibrio spp. were higher in oysters relative to other studies (average V. vulnificus 4 × 105 MPN g−1, V. parahaemolyticus 1 × 105 MPN g−1), and virulence-associated genes were detected in most oyster samples. This study provides a first estimate of storm-related Vibrio density changes in oyster tissues, sediment, and surface water at an aquaculture facility in the Chesapeake Bay.},

  abstract = {The study of microbial diversity patterns is hampered by the enormous diversity of microbial communities and the lack of resources to sample them exhaustively. For many questions about richness and evenness, however, one only needs to know the relative order of diversity among samples rather than total diversity. We used 16S libraries from the Global Ocean Survey to investigate the ability of 10 diversity statistics (including rarefaction, non-parametric, parametric, curve extrapolation and diversity indices) to assess the relative diversity of six aquatic bacterial communities. Overall, we found that the statistics yielded remarkably similar rankings of the samples for a given sequence similarity cut-off. This correspondence, despite the different underlying assumptions of the statistics, suggests that diversity statistics are a useful tool for ranking samples of microbial diversity. In addition, sequence similarity cut-off influenced the diversity ranking of the samples, demonstrating that diversity statistics can also be used to detect differences in phylogenetic structure among microbial communities. Finally, a subsampling analysis suggests that further sequencing from these particular clone libraries would not have substantially changed the richness rankings of the samples.},

Using a review of contemporary cognition research, it first hones in on the mental representation processes which drive individual sense-making in social situations. It then uses agent-based modeling (ABM), a modern simulation tool used to theorize how emergent phenomena arise from individual behaviors, to systematically demonstrate how this cognitive mechanism generates macro-level dynamics. Specifically, it shows how mental representation processes can account for cultural emergence and subgrouping, cultural path dependency and lock-in, endogenous cultural change, and the manifestation of these collective dynamics as variations in individuals’ experiences of culture. The final part of the paper discusses a few initial implications of this work including the expanded use of ABM in cultural theory, testing and verification of this theoretical work using Implicit Association Testing (IAT) and large-scale quantitative analyses, and this model's significance for existing qualitative approaches to the study of culture.},

The SAR324 group of Deltaproteobacteria is ubiquitous in the ocean and has been implicated in sulfur oxidation and carbon fixation, but also contains genomic signatures of C1 utilization and heterotrophy. Here, we reconstructed the metagenome and metatranscriptome of a population of SAR324 from a hydrothermal plume and surrounding waters in the deep Gulf of California to gain insight into the genetic capability and transcriptional dynamics of this enigmatic group. SAR324's metabolism is signified by genes that encode a novel particulate hydrocarbon monooxygenase (pHMO), degradation pathways for corresponding alcohols and short-chain fatty acids, dissimilatory sulfur oxidation, formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and a nitrite reductase (NirK). Transcripts of the pHMO, NirK, FDH and transporters for exogenous carbon and amino acid uptake were highly abundant in plume waters. Sulfur oxidation genes were also abundant in the plume metatranscriptome, indicating SAR324 may also utilize reduced sulfur species in hydrothermal fluids. These results suggest that aspects of SAR324's versatile metabolism (lithotrophy, heterotrophy and alkane oxidation) operate simultaneously, and may explain SAR324's ubiquity in the deep Gulf of California and in the global marine biosphere.},

  abstract = {It is estimated that 20-40\% of heterotrophic bacteria in the ocean are lysed by viruses every day. The lysed bacteria release nitrogen-rich cell contents that can be remineralised by other heterotrophic bacteria. To determine the effect of viruses on ammonium regeneration, two experiments were carried out in August and November 2008. Seawater from Vancouver BC was filtered to remove grazers and phytoplankton larger than 2 mu m. Bacteria were then concentrated, and diluted with virus-free water to reduce virus abundance, or with virus-replete water to recall natural virus abundances. Over two day incubations, virus-replete treatments showed increased ammonium concentrations compared to treatments with viruses removed (differences of 6.77 plus or minus 0.12 mu M and 1.90 plus or minus 0.22 mu M in August and November, respectively). As expected, bacterial cell abundances were lower in the virus-replete treatments. Nanophytoplankton cell abundances and chlorophyll a levels were both higher in the virus-replete treatments, potentially indicating the increased availability of ammonium in the presence of bacterial viruses. Our data support the hypothesis that removal of viruses reduces the amount of viral lysis of heterotrophic bacteria, thereby reducing the amount of dissolved organic nitrogen available to be remineralised by uninfected bacteria. The data suggest that viral lysis plays an important role in marine nitrogen cycling.}

  abstract = {Dissolved cobalt (dCo), iron (dFe) and aluminum (dAl) were determined in water column samples along a meridional transect (similar to 31 degrees N to 24 degrees N) south of Bermuda in June 2008. A general north-to-south increase in surface concentrations of dFe (0.3-1.6 nM) and dAl (14-42 nM) was observed, suggesting that aerosol deposition is a significant source of dFe and dAl, whereas no clear trend was observed for near-surface dCo concentrations. Shipboard aerosol samples indicate fractional solubility values of 8-100\% for aerosol Co, which are significantly higher than corresponding estimates of the solubility of aerosol Fe (0.44-45\%). Hydrographic observations and analysis of time series rain samples from Bermuda indicate that wet deposition accounts for most ({$>$}80\%) of the total aeolian flux of Co, and hence a significant proportion of the atmospheric input of dCo to our study region. Our aerosol data imply that the atmospheric input of dCo to the Sargasso Sea is modest, although this flux may be more significant in late summer. The water column dCo profiles reveal a vertical distribution that predominantly reflects 'nutrient-type' behavior, versus scavenged-type behavior for dAl, and a hybrid of nutrient-and scavenged-type behavior for dFe. Mesoscale eddies also appear to impact on the vertical distribution of dCo. The effects of biological removal of dCo from the upper water column were apparent as pronounced sub-surface minima (21 +/- 4 pM dCo), coincident with maxima in Prochlorococcus abundance. These observations imply that Prochlorococcus plays a major role in removing dCo from the euphotic zone, and that the availability of dCo may regulate Prochlorococcus growth in the Sargasso Sea.},

  abstract = {Grazing by phagotrophic flagellates and ciliates is a major source of mortality for bacterioplankton in both marine and freshwater systems. Recent studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between clearance rate and prey size for bacterivorous protists. We tested the idea that, by selectively grazing the larger (more actively growing or dividing) cells in a bacterial assemblage, protists control bacterial standing stock abundances by directly cropping bacterial production. Samples of estuarine water were passed through 0.8-μm-pore-size filters (bacteria only) or 20-μm-mesh screens (bacteria and bacterivorous protists) and placed in dialysis tubing suspended in 7 liters of unfiltered water. Changes in total bacterial biovolume per milliliter (bacterial biomass), frequency of dividing cells (FDC), and average per cell biovolume were followed over a period of 24 h. In three experiments, the FDC increased more rapidly and attained higher values in water passed through 0.8-μm-pore-size filters (average, 5.1 to 8.9\%; maximum, 15.5\%) compared with FDC values in water passed through 20-μm-mesh screens (average, 2.7 to 5.3\%; maximum, 6.7\%). Increases in bacterial biomass per milliliter lagged behind increases in FDC by about 4 to 6 h. Grazed bacterial assemblages were characterized by lower total biomasses and smaller average cell sizes compared with those of cells in nongrazed assemblages. We conclude that bacterivorous protists control bacterial standing stock abundances partly by preferentially removing dividing cells. Selective grazing of the more actively growing cells may also explain, in part, the ability of slow-growing cells to persist in bacterioplankton assemblages.},

  abstract = {As part of an ongoing survey of microbial community gene expression in the ocean, we sequenced and compared ∼38\,Mbp of community transcriptomes and ∼157\,Mbp of community genomes from four bacterioplankton samples, along a defined depth profile at Station ALOHA in North Pacific subtropical gyre (NPSG). Taxonomic analysis suggested that the samples were dominated by three taxa: Prochlorales, Consistiales and Cenarchaeales, which comprised 36–69\% and 29–63\% of the annotated sequences in the four DNA and four cDNA libraries, respectively. The relative abundance of these taxonomic groups was sometimes very different in the DNA and cDNA libraries, suggesting differential relative transcriptional activities per cell. For example, the 125\,m sample genomic library was dominated by Pelagibacter (∼36\% of sequence reads), which contributed fewer sequences to the community transcriptome (∼11\%). Functional characterization of highly expressed genes suggested taxon-specific contributions to specific biogeochemical processes. Examples included Roseobacter relatives involved in aerobic anoxygenic phototrophy at 75\,m, and an unexpected contribution of low abundance Crenarchaea to ammonia oxidation at 125\,m. Read recruitment using reference microbial genomes indicated depth-specific partitioning of coexisting microbial populations, highlighted by a transcriptionally active high-light-like Prochlorococcus population in the bottom of the photic zone. Additionally, nutrient-uptake genes dominated Pelagibacter transcripts, with apparent enrichment for certain transporter types (for example, the C4-dicarboxylate transport system) over others (for example, phosphate transporters). In total, the data support the utility of coupled DNA and cDNA analyses for describing taxonomic and functional attributes of microbial communities in their natural habitats.},

Such spatial heterogeneity is present in associations with dead and living particles, including zooplankton. The microbial community composition of mesozooplankton was investigated from the Sargasso Sea using 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing. Zooplankton microbiomes were studied on the copepods Undinula vulgaris, Pleuromamma spp., Sapphirina metalina, Pseudocalanus spp. and Tigriopus sp., and an amphipod, Phrosina semilunata. The overall richness was lower in the zooplankton than in the seawater, and zooplankton-specific bacterial communities were distinct from the communities in seawater. Gammaproteobacteria dominated in all zooplankton studied, with Vibrio spp. highly represented. Firmicutes were detected in all copepods, providing evidence for anaerobic conditions present on the copepods. Bacterial groups known to grow on concentrated organic substrates or to prevent biofouling were highly represented in association with copepods, suggesting they benefit from copepod-derived nutrients or carbon. The described copepod microbiome has similarities to communities previously described in coastal copepods, suggesting some aspects of the copepod microbiome are not habitat specific. The communities are distinct of that in seawater, demonstrating significant microbial patchiness in association with marine zooplankton in the oligotrophic open ocean.},

The combination of cold, heat (from possible hydrothermal activity), pressure (from the overriding glacier), limited nutrients and complete darkness presents extreme challenges to life. Here, we report metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequence analyses from four accretion ice sections from the Vostok 5G ice core. Two sections accreted in the vicinity of an embayment on the southwestern end of the lake, and the other two represented part of the southern main basin. We obtained 3,507 unique gene sequences from concentrates of 500 ml of 0.22 µm-filtered accretion ice meltwater. Taxonomic classifications (to genus and/or species) were possible for 1,623 of the sequences. Species determinations in combination with mRNA gene sequence results allowed deduction of the metabolic pathways represented in the accretion ice and, by extension, in the lake. Approximately 94\% of the sequences were from Bacteria and 6\% were from Eukarya. Only two sequences were from Archaea. In general, the taxa were similar to organisms previously described from lakes, brackish water, marine environments, soil, glaciers, ice, lake sediments, deep-sea sediments, deep-sea thermal vents, animals and plants. Sequences from aerobic, anaerobic, psychrophilic, thermophilic, halophilic, alkaliphilic, acidophilic, desiccation-resistant, autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms were present, including a number from multicellular eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Time Series Analysis and Its Applications presents a balanced and comprehensive treatment of both time and frequency domain methods with accompanying theory. Numerous examples using nontrivial data illustrate solutions to problems such as discovering natural and anthropogenic climate change, evaluating pain perception experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging, and monitoring a nuclear test ban treaty. The book is designed to be useful as a text for graduate level students in the physical, biological and social sciences and as a graduate level text in statistics. Some parts may also serve as an undergraduate introductory course. Theory and methodology are separated to allow presentations on different levels. In addition to coverage of classical methods of time series regression, ARIMA models, spectral analysis and state-space models, the text includes modern developments including categorical time series analysis, multivariate spectral methods, long memory series, nonlinear models, resampling techniques, GARCH models, stochastic volatility, wavelets and Monte Carlo Markov chain integration methods. The third edition includes a new section on testing for unit roots and the material on state-space modeling, ARMAX models, and regression with autocorrelated errors have been expanded. Also new to this edition is the enhanced use of the freeware statistical package R. In particular, R code is now included in the text for nearly all of the numerical examples. Data sets and additional R scripts are now provided in one file that may be downloaded via the World Wide Web. This R supplement is a small compressed file that can be loaded easily into R making all the data sets and scripts available to the user with one simple command. The website for the text includes the code used in each example so that the reader may simply copy-and-paste code directly into R. Appendix R, which is new to this edition, provides a reference for the data sets and our R scripts that are used throughout the text. In addition, Appendix R includes a tutorial on basic R commands as well as an R time series tutorial.},

  abstract = {Ocean ecosystems play a critical role in the Earth’s carbon cycle and the quantification of their impacts for both present conditions and for predictions into the future remains one of the greatest challenges in oceanography. The goal of the EXport Processes in the Ocean from Remote Sensing (EXPORTS) Science Plan is to develop a predictive understanding of the export and fate of global ocean net primary production (NPP) and its implications for present and future climates. The achievement of this goal requires a quantification of the mechanisms that control the export of carbon from the euphotic zone as well as its fate in the underlying “twilight zone” where some fraction of exported carbon will be sequestered in the ocean’s interior on time scales of months to millennia. Here we present a measurement / synthesis / modeling framework aimed at quantifying the fates of upper ocean NPP and its impacts on the global carbon cycle based upon the EXPORTS Science Plan. The proposed approach will diagnose relationships among the ecological, biogeochemical and physical oceanographic processes that control carbon cycling across a range of ecosystem and carbon cycling states leading to advances in satellite diagnostic and numerical prognostic models. To collect these data, a combination of ship and robotic field sampling, satellite remote sensing and numerical modeling is proposed which enables the sampling of the many pathways of NPP export and fates. This coordinated, process-oriented approach has the potential to foster new insights on ocean carbon cycling that maximizes its societal relevance through the achievement of research goals of many international research agencies and will be a key step towards our understanding of the Earth as an integrated system.},

  abstract = {Network science provides a set of quantitative methods to investigate complex systems, including human cognition. Although cognitive theories in different domains are strongly based on a network perspective, the application of network science methodologies to quantitatively study cognition has so far been limited in scope. This review demonstrates how network science approaches have been applied to the study of human cognition and how network science can uniquely address and provide novel insight on important questions related to the complexity of cognitive systems and the processes that occur within those systems. Drawing on the literature in cognitive network science, with a focus on semantic and lexical networks, we argue three key points. (i) Network science provides a powerful quantitative approach to represent cognitive systems. (ii) The network science approach enables cognitive scientists to achieve a deeper understanding of human cognition by capturing how the structure, i.e., the underlying network, and processes operating on a network structure interact to produce behavioral phenomena. (iii) Network science provides a quantitative framework to model the dynamics of cognitive systems, operationalized as structural changes in cognitive systems on different timescales and resolutions. Finally, we highlight key milestones that the field of cognitive network science needs to achieve as it matures in order to provide continued insights into the nature of cognitive structures and processes.},

  abstract = {The Carbon, Absorption, and Fluorescence Euphotic-resolving (CAFE) net primary production model is an adaptable framework for advancing global ocean productivity assessments by exploiting state-of-the-art satellite ocean color analyses and addressing key physiological and ecological attributes of phytoplankton. Here we present the first implementation of the CAFE model that incorporates inherent optical properties derived from ocean color measurements into a mechanistic and accurate model of phytoplankton growth rates (μ) and net phytoplankton production (NPP). The CAFE model calculates NPP as the product of energy absorption (QPAR), and the efficiency (ϕμ) by which absorbed energy is converted into carbon biomass (CPhyto), while μ is calculated as NPP normalized to CPhyto. The CAFE model performance is evaluated alongside 21 other NPP models against a spatially robust and globally representative set of direct NPP measurements. This analysis demonstrates that the CAFE model explains the greatest amount of variance and has the lowest model bias relative to other NPP models analyzed with this data set. Global oceanic NPP from the CAFE model (52\,Pg\,C\,m−2\,yr−1) and mean division rates (0.34\,day−1) are derived from climatological satellite data (2002–2014). This manuscript discusses and validates individual CAFE model parameters (e.g., QPAR and ϕμ), provides detailed sensitivity analyses, and compares the CAFE model results and parameterization to other widely cited models.},

Time course samples were taken from the bags and the reservoir to estimate bacterial abundance, mean cell volume, production, protistan grazing, viral abundance, and frequency of visibly infected cells. Shifts in bacterial community composition (BCC) were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), cloning and sequencing of 16S rDNA genes from the different treatments, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (PISH) with previously employed and newly designed oligonucleotide probes, Changes in bacterioplankton characteristics were clearly linked to changes in mortality rates. In the reservoir, where bacterial production about equaled protist grazing and viral mortality, community characteristics were nearly invariant, In the “grazer-free” (0.8-mum-filtered) treatment, subject only to a relatively low mortality rate (similar to 17\% day(-1)) from viral lysis, bacteria increased markedly in concentration. While the mean bacterial cell volume was invariant, DGGE indicated a shift in BCC and FISH revealed an increase in the proportion of one lineage within the beta proteobacteria, In the grazing-enhanced treatment (5-mum filtrate), grazing mortality was similar to 200\% and viral lysis resulted in mortality of 30\% of daily production. Cell concentrations declined, and grazing-resistant flocs and filaments eventually dominated the biomass, together accounting for {$>$} 80\% of the total bacteria by the end of the experiment. Once again, BCC changed strongly and a significant fraction of the large filaments was detected using a FISH probe targeted to members of the Flectobacillus lineage, Shifts of BCC were also reflected in DGGE patterns and in the increases in the relative importance of both beta proteobacteria and members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster, which consistently formed different parts of the bacterial flocs. Viral concentrations and frequencies of infected cells were highly significantly correlated with grazing rates, suggesting that protistan grazing may stimulate viral activity.},

Experiments were conducted in the Rimov Reservoir (South Bohemia) during the clear-water phase (experiment I), a period of law protistan gazing pressure on reservoir bacterioplankton, and during the late summer phytoplankton peak (experiment II), a period of high protistan grazing pressure. In both experiments, there was a significant shift in BCC in the {$<$}5 mu m treatments, which came in the form of increased proportions of alpha subclass of the class Proteobacteria (ALF) and Cytophaga/Flavobacterium group (C/F), corresponding with increased bacterivory of the ungrazed HNF populations. Changes in BCC in other experimental treatments were related to preincubation protistan grazing pressure. In experiment I, bacterioplankton were subjected to negligible protistan bacterivory in the reservoir and did not shaw a change in BCC in the predator-free treatment ({$<$}1 mu m), while BCC changed in treatments that yielded increases in protistan bacterivory compared with that in the ambient reservoir water. In experiment II, a significant shift in BCC was induced when bacterioplankton that were subjected to heavy predation pressure in the reservoir were transferred into the predator-free treatment. Treatments that induced small changes in protistan grazing pressure ({$<$}20 mu m and UNF in experiment II) did not show significant BCC shifts. Proportions of filamentous bacteria ({$>$}4 mu m) increased in treatments that yielded large increases in bacterivory. Filament formation also showed season-specific features; in experiment I, all filaments belonged into ALF, whereas in experiment II, most of them hybridized with the C/F probe.

  abstract = {We studied the biomass and production of heterotrophic bacteria on several types of marine snow including those composed predominantly of \&atoms, fecal pellets, larvacean house mucus, or miscellaneous detrital components at 8 stations in the Pacific Ocean off California. We concurrently measured photoautotrophic biomass and production, and particulate organic carbon (POC) on marine snow to examine the quantitative significance of bacterial processes in carbon flow pathways in different types of marine snow Although a typical marine snow floc contained about 106bacteria, the bacterial carbon (BOC)and phytoplankton carbon (PhytoC)were each {$<$} 13 \% of total POC. Most of the floc carbon therefore consisted of detritus, unlike whole seawater samples (in other studies) where + BOC PhytoC generally comprises about 50 \% of the POC. PhytoC on marine snow and in the surrounding water was generally similar to BOC (except at one station). Floc POC turnover time based on bacterial carbon demand. assuming a 30 OO/ carbon assimilation efficiency, was 20 to 100 d. This was comparable to the POC residence time reported for the Southern California Bight. Bacterial specific growth rates on flocs varied greatly between stations (0.06 to 0.96 d-l) with highest values at stations with diatom flocs where they were comparable to growth rates of free-living bacteria in mesotrophic waters. The ratio of bacterial carbon production to primary production on marine snow was typical of seawater samples from other studies. Bacterial carbon production was measured by the leucine incorporation method while bacterial cell production (and growth rate) was measured by the thymidlne incorporation method simultaneously on the same marine snow floc. We could thus calculate bacterial carbon per-new-cell (C,) and compare it with the microscopy-based average carbon per cell (C,,) to test the hypothesis that new cells reflect the average carbon content of the parent assemblage (bacteria on marine snow were much larger than those in the surrounding water). In 73 \% of our samples the carbon content of the new daughter cells was within a factor of 1.5 of the carbon content of the parent cells.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Macroscopic organic aggregates, which are {$>$}500 μm and known as marine and lake snow, are important components in the turnover, decomposition and sinking flux of both organic and inorganic matter and elements in aquatic ecosystems. They are composed of various organic and inorganic materials depending largely on the given system and environmental conditions. The systems include the pelagic limnetic, the neritic and oceanic marine region, as well as shallow turbid environments, e.g. rivers, the littoral zone of lakes, estuaries and tidally affected coastal areas with intense turbulence and a high load of suspended matter. Aggregate abundance and size vary greatly among these systems. Macroaggregates are heavily colonized by bacteria and other heterotrophic microbes and greatly enriched in organic and inorganic nutrients as compared to the surrounding water. During the last 15 yr, many studies have been carried out to examine various aspects of the formation of aggregates, their microbial colonization and decomposition, nutrient recycling and their significance for the sinking flux. They have been identified as hot-spots of the microbial decomposition of organic matter. Further, microaggregates, which are {$<$}5 to 500 μm in size and stained by different dyes, such as transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and Coomassie blue-stained particles, have been discovered and shown also to be important in the formation and decomposition of macroaggregates. In this review we give an overview of the present state of the microbial ecology of macro- and microaggregates, including the mentioned points but highlighting in particular the recent findings on the bacterial colonization of aggregates using molecular tools, their microbial decomposition and mineralization, and the significance of protozoans and metazoans for the colonization and decomposition of macroaggregates. Today it is evident that not only the aggregates but also their surroundings are sites and hot-spots of microbial processes, with the plume of solutes leaking out of the aggregates and greatly extending the volume of the intense decomposition processes. This microheterogeneity has important implications for the spatial and temporal dynamics of the organic-matter field in aquatic ecosystems and for our understanding of how heterotrophic organisms are involved in the decomposition of organic matter. The significance of aggregate-associated microbial processes as key processes and also for the overall decomposition and flux of organic mattervaries greatly among the various systems, and is greatly affected by the total amount of suspended particulate matter. A conclusion from the presented studies and results is that the significance of bacteria for the formation and decomposition of aggregates appears to be much greater than previously estimated. For a better understanding of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems it is of great importance to include aggregate-associated processes in ecosystem modeling approaches.},

  abstract = {The composition of digestive microbiomes is known to be a significant factor in the health of a variety of hosts, including animal livestock. Therefore, it is important to ascertain how readily the microbiome can be significantly altered. To this end, the role of changing diet on the digestive microbiome of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) was assessed via weekly faecal sampling. Over the course of 12 weeks, isolated individual oysters were fed either a control diet of Tetraselmis algae (Tet) or a treatment diet which shifted in composition every 4 weeks. Weekly faecal samples from all oysters were taken to characterize their digestive bacterial microbiota. Concurrent weekly sampling of the algal feed cultures was performed to assess the effect of algal microbiomes, independent of the algal type, on the microbiomes observed in the oyster samples. Changing the algal feed was found to be significantly associated with changes in the faecal microbiome over a timescale of weeks between control and treatment groups. No significant differences between individual microbiomes were found within control and treatment groups. This suggests the digestive microbiome of the Pacific oyster can be quickly and reproducibly manipulated.},

  abstract = {In the absence of annual laminations, time series generated from lake sediments or other similar stratigraphic sequences are irregularly spaced in time, which complicates formal analysis using classical statistical time series models. In lieu, statistical analyses of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series, if done at all, have typically used simpler linear regressions or (non-) parametric correlations with little regard for the violation of assumptions that almost surely occurs due to temporal dependencies in the data or that correlations do not provide estimates of the magnitude of change, just whether or not there is a linear or monotonic trend. Alternative approaches have used LOESS-estimated trends to justify data interpretations or test hypotheses as to the causal factors without considering the inherent subjectivity of the choice of parameters used to achieve the LOESS fit (e.g. span width, degree of polynomial). Generalized additive models (GAMs) are statistical models that can be used to estimate trends as smooth functions of time. Unlike LOESS, GAMs use automatic smoothness selection methods to objectively determine the complexity of the fitted trend, and as formal statistical models, GAMs, allow for potentially complex, non-linear trends, a proper accounting of model uncertainty, and the identification of periods of significant temporal change. Here, I present a consistent and modern approach to the estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series using GAMs, illustrating features of the methodology with two example time series of contrasting complexity; a 150-year bulk organic matter δ15N time series from Small Water, UK, and a 3000-year alkenone record from Braya-Sø, Greenland. I discuss the underlying mechanics of GAMs that allow them to learn the shape of the trend from the data themselves and how simultaneous confidence intervals and the first derivatives of the trend are used to properly account for model uncertainty and identify periods of change. It is hoped that by using GAMs greater attention is paid to the statistical estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series leading to more a robust and reproducible palaeoscience.},

  abstract = {There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3\%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.},

This book examines the historical occurrence and geographical spread of infectious diseases in association with past wars. It addresses an intrinsically geographical question: how are the spatial dynamics of epidemics influenced by militaryoperations and the directives of war? The term historical geography in the title indicates the authors' primary concern with qualitative analyses of archival source materials over a 150-year time period from 1850, and this is combined with quantitative analyses less frequently associated with historicalstudies.Written from the viewpoints of historical geography, epidemiology, and spatial analysis, this book examines in four parts the historical occurrence and geographical spread of infectious diseases in association with wars. Part I: War and Disease, surveys war-disease associations from early times to 1850. Part II: Temporal Trends studies time trends since 1850. Part III: A Regional Pattern of War Epidemics, examines grand themes in the war-disease complex. Part IV:Prospects, considers a series of war-related issues of epidemiological significance in the twenty-first century.},

Some specific examples are discussed, and the associated settling rates, depositional characteristics and individual species responses are examined in relationship to experimentally determined sinking rates of both living and dead, intact phytoplankton. The data include field and experimental observations on the sinking behavior for the same species. The in vitro rates are too low, and a mechanism or mechanisms causing accelerated rates of phytoplankton sinking in situ seems necessary to account adequately for some of the observed transport of phytoplankton remains to great depths and to the sea floor. Various potential mechanisms of heightened diatom, dinoflagellate and coccolithophorid sinking rates are then outlined and examined quantitatively. These include density inversion plumes, downwelling, and fecal pellet sinking. Sinking rates of naturally occurring fecal pellets and those produced by cultured zooplankton are presented. The importance of fecal pellet settling as a means of accelerated sinking of phytoplankton remains to depth, and their subsequent contribution to the fossil record and organic content of ocean floor sediments are then discussed.},

  abstract = {The Columbia River (CR) is a powerful economic and environmental driver in the US Pacific Northwest. Microbial communities in the water column were analyzed from four diverse habitats: (1) an estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM), (2) a chlorophyll maximum of the river plume, (3) an upwelling-associated hypoxic zone, and (4) the deep ocean bottom. Three size fractions, 0.1–0.8, 0.8–3, and 3–200 μm were collected for each habitat in August 2007, and used for DNA isolation and 454 sequencing, resulting in 12 metagenomes of {$>$}5 million reads ({$>$}1.6 Gbp). To characterize the dominant microorganisms and metabolisms contributing to coastal biogeochemistry, we used predicted peptide and rRNA data. The 3- and 0.8-μm metagenomes, representing particulate fractions, were taxonomically diverse across habitats. The 3-μm size fractions contained a high abundance of eukaryota with diatoms dominating the hypoxic water and plume, while cryptophytes were more abundant in the ETM. The 0.1-μm metagenomes represented mainly free-living bacteria and archaea. The most abundant archaeal hits were observed in the deep ocean and hypoxic water (19\% of prokaryotic peptides in the 0.1-μm metagenomes), and were homologous to Nitrosopumilus maritimus (ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota). Bacteria dominated metagenomes of all samples. In the euphotic zone (estuary, plume and hypoxic ocean), the most abundant bacterial taxa (≥40\% of prokaryotic peptides) represented aerobic photoheterotrophs. In contrast, the low-oxygen, deep water metagenome was enriched with sequences for strict and facultative anaerobes. Interestingly, many of the same anaerobic bacterial families were enriched in the 3-μm size fraction of the ETM (2–10X more abundant relative to the 0.1-μm metagenome), indicating possible formation of anoxic microniches within particles. Results from this study provide a metagenome perspective on ecosystem-scale metabolism in an upwelling-influenced river-dominated coastal margin.},

The hydraulics of DEUF and microbe recovery for a new DEUF method were investigated using 100-liter tap water samples. Pressure, flow rate, and temperature were investigated using four hollow-fiber ultrafilter types. Based on hydraulic performance, the Asahi Kasei REXEED 25S ultrafilter was selected for microbe recovery experiments. Microbe recovery experiments were performed using MS2 bacteriophage, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens spores, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. Microbes were recovered from ultrafilters by backflushing using a surfactant solution. Average flow rates were 2.1 liters/min for 100-liter water samples having turbidities of 0.28 to 4.3 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), and no evidence of appreciable filter clogging was observed. The DEUF average recovery efficiencies for each study analyte in tap water were as follows: for E. faecalis, 93\% ± 16\%; for MS2, 57\% ± 7.7\%; for C. perfringens spores, 94\% ± 22\%; and for C. parvum, 87\% ± 18\%. Average microbe recoveries for tap water amended with surface water (average turbidity = 4.3 NTU) were as follows: for E. faecalis, 78\% ± 12\%; for MS2, 73\% ± 13\%; for C. perfringens, 57\% ± 21\%; and for C. parvum, 83\% ± 21\%.

We monitored MC concentrations in three levels of an aquatic food web: phytoplankton, zooplankton, and sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus). Bosmina appeared to be both a major accumulator of MC in zooplankton and the major vector of MC to sunfish. In an accumulation experiment, sunfish were brought into the laboratory and fed MC-rich zooplankton pellets (50ngMCkg−1d−1) for 9 days. Zooplankton directly transferred MC to sunfish, resulting in liver and muscle tissue accumulation. However, after 6 days of accumulation fish significantly decreased concentrations in their liver and muscle tissue, indicating the induction of a detoxification and excretion pathway. Sunfish retained MC in their liver and muscle tissue, showing no significant changes in toxin concentration over 2 weeks of fasted depuration.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in development of in situ video settling columns have significantly contributed toward fine-sediment dynamics research through concurrent measurement of suspended sediment floc size distributions and settling velocities, which together also allow inference of floc density. Along with image resolution and sizing, two additional challenges in video analysis from these devices are the automated tracking of settling particles and accounting for fluid motions within the settling column. A combination of particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) image analysis techniques is described, which permits general automation of image analysis collected from video settling columns. In the fixed image plane, large-particle velocities are determined by PTV and small-particle velocities are tracked by PIV and treated as surrogates for fluid velocities. The large-particle settling velocity (relative to the suspending fluid) is determined by the vector difference of the large and small-particle settling velocities. The combined PTV/PIV image analysis approach is demonstrated for video settling column data collected within a dredge plume in Boston Harbor. The automated PTV/PIV approach significantly reduces uncertainties in measured settling velocity and inferred floc density.},

  abstract = {LARGE, rapidly sinking organic aggregates are an important component of the carbon flux from the ocean's surface to its depths. Marine snow, the main type of large ({$>$}0.5 mm) aggregate, is heavily colonized by bacteria in surface waters1, yet the carbon demand of the attached bacteria is so small that months to years are required to consume the aggregates' carbon2-5. This has led to the conclusion that marine aggregates are resistant to degradation by attached bacteria, and thus act as refractory carriers of carbon to the deep ocean. Here we report that aggregates play host to intense activities of hydrolytic enzymes (presumably due to cell surface bound and released enzymes of the attached bacteria), which render the aggregates soluble. Particulate amino acids were hydrolysed rapidly (turnover time 0.2-2.1 days), with very little of the hydrolysate being taken up by the attached bacteria. Our results support the hypothesis6,7 that such 'uncoupled' hydrolysis is a biochemical mechanism for large-scale transfer of organic matter from sinking particles to the dissolved phase, and may supply the slowly degradable dissolved organic matter for downward export postulated by recent models8-10.},

  abstract = {Seagrass beds have declined in Chesapeake Bay, USA as well as worldwide over the past century. Increased seston concentrations, which decrease light penetration, are likely one of the main causes of the decline in Chesapeake Bay. It has been hypothesized that dense populations of suspension-feeding bivalves, such as eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), may filter sufficient seston from the water to reduce light attenuation and enhance seagrass growth. Furthermore, eastern oyster populations can form large three-dimensional reef-like structures that may act like breakwaters by attenuating waves, thus decreasing sediment resuspension. We developed a quasi-three-dimensional Seagrass-Waves-Oysters-Light-Seston (SWOLS) model to investigate whether oyster reefs and breakwaters could improve seagrass growth by reducing seston concentrations. Seagrass growth potential (SGP), a parameter controlled by resuspension-induced turbidity, was calculated in simulations in which wave height, oyster abundance, and reef/breakwater configuration were varied. Wave height was the dominant factor influencing SGP, with higher waves increasing sediment resuspension and decreasing SGP. Submerged breakwaters parallel with the shoreline improved SGP in the presence of 0.2 and 0.4 m waves when sediment resuspension was dominated by wave action, while submerged groins perpendicular to the shoreline improved SGP under lower wave heights (0.05 and 0.1 m) when resuspension was dominated by along-shore tidal currents. Oyster-feeding activity did not affect SGP, due to the oysters' distance from the seagrass bed and reduced oyster filtration rates under either low or high sediment concentrations. Although the current implementation of the SWOLS model has simplified geometry, the model does demonstrate that the interaction between oyster filtration and along-shore circulation, and between man-made structures and wave heights, should be considered when managing seagrass habitats, planning seagrass restoration projects, and choosing the most suitable methods to protect shorelines from erosion.

  abstract = {Individual cell growth rates enhance our understanding of microbial roles in regulating organic matter flux in marine and other aquatic systems. We devised a protocol to microscopically detect and quantify bacteria undergoing replication in seawater using the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU), which becomes incorporated into bacterial DNA and is detected with a ‘click’ chemistry reaction in {$<$}1 h. Distinct EdU localization patterns were observed within individual labeled cells, e.g. some displayed 2 or more distinct EdU loci within a single DAPIstained region, which likely indicated poleward migration of nascent DNA during the early phase of replication. Cell labeling ranged from 4.4 to 49\%, comparable with cell labeling in parallel incubations for 3H-thymidine microautoradiography. Meanwhile, EdU signal intensities in cells ranged {$>$} 3 orders of magnitude, wherein the most intensely labeled cells comprised most of a sample’s sum community EdU signal, e.g. 26\% of cells comprised 80\% of the sum signal. This ability to rapidly detect and quantify signals in labeled DN A is an important step toward a robust approach for the determination of single-cell growth rates in natural assemblages and for linking growth rates with microscale biogeochemical dynamics.},

The use of probiotic bacteria is a potential preventative measure to limit the impact of bacterial diseases. Previous research showed that the marine bacteria Phaeobacter inhibens S4 (S4) and Bacillus pumilus RI06—95 (RI) protect larval eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) when challenged with the pathogens Vibrio tubiashii RE22 (now Vibrio coralliilyticus RE22) and Roseovarius crassostreae CV919-312T. In this study, these probiotic bacteria were tested under hatchery conditions. Daily addition of S4 and RI (104 colony forming units (CFU)/ml) to 100-l culture tanks resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of total Vibrios in water and tank surfaces (P {$<$} 0.05), but not in oysters. Larval growth and survival was unaffected by the probiotic treatments. Larvae treated with probiotics in the hatchery showed significantly less mortality than larvae from control tanks when exposed to 105 CFU/ml of V. coralliilyticus RE22 for 24 h in a laboratory challenge. These results suggest that S4 and RI are safe and potentially effective tools to limit disease outbreaks in oyster hatcheries.},

  abstract = {Synechococcus is widely distributed in the world's ocean surfaces, and is often found in sediment traps. However, its distribution and ecological importance have not been well studied in meso-and bathypelagic waters. We measured Synechococcus abundance in the Suruga Bay (central Japan) and the subtropical NW Pacific. Synechococcus abundance at depths of 200 m and below varied from 2.4 to 190 cells ml(-1), but was in proportion to the surface abundance, suggesting transport of epipelagic populations to greater depths. Surprisingly, Synechococcus was evenly distributed from 200 m down to 1420 m (Suruga Bay) or to 2000 m (subtropical NW Pacific), regardless of season. The contribution of deep Synechococcus to the total population was highest in spring in the Suruga Bay (36 to 77\%), and lowest in summer in the Suruga Bay (1 to 9\%) and in the subtropical NW Pacific (4 and 10\%). These results suggest effective transport of Synechococcus cells down the water column during productive seasons by attachment to large particles and limited transport under oligotrophic and stratified conditions. Deep Synechococcus abundance decreased from fall to winter in the Suruga Bay, though in filtered deep seawater it did not significantly decrease for 30 d in the dark, and it increased in a light/dark cycle. Our investigations show that the standing stock of Synechococcus has been significantly underestimated in previous studies of epipelagic waters conducted during productive seasons and that Synechococcus seems to be grazed and to contribute to biogeochemical cycles in the dark ocean.},

We estimated GI illness risks via quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) techniques by consolidating site specific pathogen monitoring data of stormwater, site specific dilution estimates, literature-based water ingestion data, and literature based pathogen dose-response and morbidity information. Our water quality results indicated that human sources of contamination contribute viral and bacterial pathogens to streams draining an urban watershed during wet weather that then enter the ocean and affect nearshore water quality. We evaluated a series of approaches to account for uncertainty in the norovirus dose-response model selection and compared our model results to those from a concurrently conducted epidemiological study that provided empirical estimates for illness risk following ocean exposure. The preferred norovirus dose-response approach yielded median risk estimates for water recreation-associated illness (15 GI illnesses per 1000 recreation events) that closely matched the reported epidemiological results (12 excess GI illnesses per 1000 wet weather recreation events). The results are consistent with norovirus, or other pathogens associated with norovirus, as an important cause of gastrointestinal illness among surfers in this setting. This study demonstrates the applicability of QMRA for recreational water risk estimation, even under wet weather conditions and describes a process that might be useful in developing site-specific water quality criteria in this and other locations.},

  abstract = {Successful Invaders Invasive species have been integrated into ecosystems worldwide, and in many cases can cause significant ecological and economic damage. Not all non-native species, however, become invasive species; thus there has been much effort put toward understanding what makes a non-native “colonizer” an invader. It has been thought that, in general, successful invaders tend to be those that produce a large amount of offspring over a very short period of time, however, this pattern is absent in many successful invaders. Sol et al. (p. 580) looked at over 2700 invasions by bird species across the world and found no relationship between population growth rate and invasion success, although rapidly reproducing species could have an advantage when the new environment resembled their native environment. Furthermore, in many cases, those species that could prioritize survival, and delay reproduction, were much more successful than those forced to reproduce regardless of environmental conditions. Despite considerable current interest in biological invasions, the common life-history characteristics of successful invaders remain elusive. The widely held hypothesis that successful invaders have high reproductive rates has received little empirical support; however, alternative possibilities are seldom considered. Combining a global comparative analysis of avian introductions ({$>$}2700 events) with demographic models and phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that although rapid population growth may be advantageous during invasions under certain circumstances, more generally successful invaders are characterized by life-history strategies in which they give priority to future rather than current reproduction. High future breeding expectations reduce the costs of reproductive failure under uncertain conditions and increase opportunities to explore the environment and respond to novel ecological pressures. Allocating resources to long-lived adults is one means by which birds succeed in new niches. Allocating resources to long-lived adults is one means by which birds succeed in new niches.},

  abstract = {Based on existing knowledge about phytoplankton responses to nutrients and food size spectra of herbivorous zooplankton, three different configurations of pelagic food webs are proposed for three different types of marine nutrient regimes: (1) upwelling systems, (2) oligotrophic oceanic systems, (3) eutrophicated coastal systems. Up-welling systems are characterised by high levels of plant nutrients and high ratios of Si to N and R. Phytoplankton consists mainly of diatoms together with a subdominant contribution of flagellates. Most phytoplankton falls into the food spectrum of herbivorous, crustacean zooplankton. Therefore, herbivorous crustaceans occupy trophic level 2 and zooplanktivorous fish occupy trophic level 3. Phytoplankton in oligotrophic, oceanic systems is dominated by picoplankton, which are too small to be ingested by copepods. Most primary production is channelled through the ‘microbial loop’ (picoplankton — heterotrophic nanoflagellates — ciliates). Sporadically, pelagic tunicates also consume a substantial proportion of primary production. Herbivorous crustaceans feed on heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates, thus occupying a food chain position between 3 and 4, which leads to a food chain position between 4 and 5 for zooplanktivorous fish. By cultural eutrophication, N and P availability are elevated while Si remains unaffected or even declines. Diatoms decrease in relative importance while summer blooms of inedible algae (Phaeocystis, toxic dinoflagellates, toxic prymnesiophyceae, etc.) prevail. The spring bloom may still contain a substantial contribution of diatoms. The production of the inedible algae enters the pelagic energy flow via the detritus food chain: DOC release by cell lysis — bacteria — heterotrophic nanoflagellates — ciliates. Accordingly, crustacean zooplankton occupy food chain position 4 to 5 during the non-diatom seasons. Ecological efficiency considerations lead to the conclusion that fish production:primary production ratios should be highest in upwelling systems and substantially lower in oligotrophic and in culturally eutrophicated systems. Further losses of fish production may occur when carnivorous, gelatinous zooplankton (jellyfish) replace fish.},

  abstract = {Long-term research in the western English Channel, undertaken by the marine laboratories in Plymouth, is described and details of survey methods, sites, and time series given in this chapter. Major findings are summarized and their limitations outlined. Current research, with recent reestablishment and expansion of many sampling programmes, is presented, and possible future approaches are indicated. These unique long-term data sets provide an environmental baseline for predicting complex ecological responses to local, regional, and global environmental change. Between 1888 and the present, investigations have been carried out into the physical, chemical, and biological components (ranging from plankton and fish to benthic and intertidal assemblages) of the western English Channel ecosystem. The Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom has performed the main body of these observations. More recent contributions come from the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey, now the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, dating from 1957; the Institute for Marine Environmental Research, from 1974 to 1987; and the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, which was formed by amalgamation of the Institute for Marine Environmental Research and part of the Marine Biological Association, from 1988. Together, these contributions constitute a unique data series—one of the longest and most comprehensive samplings of environmental and marine biological variables in the world. Since the termination of many of these time series in 1987–1988 during a reorganisation of UK marine research, there has been a resurgence of interest in long-term environmental change. Many programmes have been restarted and expanded with support from several agencies. The observations span significant periods of warming (1921–1961; 1985–present) and cooling (1962–1980). During these periods of change, the abundance of key species underwent dramatic shifts. The first period of warming saw changes in zooplankton, pelagic fish, and larval fish, including the collapse of an important herring fishery. During later periods of change, shifts in species abundances have been reflected in other assemblages, such as the intertidal zone and the benthic fauna. Many of these changes appear to be related to climate, manifested as temperature changes, acting directly or indirectly. The hypothesis that climate is a forcing factor is widely supported today and has been reinforced by recent studies that show responses of marine organisms to climatic attributes such as the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The long-term data also yield important insights into the effects of anthropogenic disturbances such as fisheries exploitation and pollution. Comparison of demersal fish hauls over time highlights fisheries effects not only on commercially important species but also on the entire demersal community. The effects of acute (“Torrey Canyon” oil spill) and chronic (tributyltin [TBT] antifoulants) pollution are clearly seen in the intertidal records. Significant advances in diverse scientific disciplines have been generated from research undertaken alongside the long-term data series. Many concepts in marine biological textbooks have originated in part from this work (e.g. the seasonal cycle of plankton, the cycling of nutrients, the pelagic food web trophic interactions, and the influence of hydrography on pelagic communities). Associated projects currently range from studies of marine viruses and bacterial ecology to zooplankton feeding dynamics and validation of ocean colour satellite sensors. Recent advances in technology mean these long-term programmes are more valuable than ever before. New technology collects data on finer temporal and spatial scales and can be used to capture processes that operate on multiple scales and help determine their influence in the marine environment. The MBA has been in the forefront of environmental modelling of shelf seas since the early 1970s. Future directions being pursued include the continued development of coupled physical-ecosystem models using western English Channel time-series data. These models will include both the recent high-resolution data and the long-term time-series information to predict effects of future climate change scenarios. It would be beneficial to provide more spatial and high-resolution temporal context to these data, which are fundamental for capturing processes that operate at multiple scales and understanding how they operate within the marine environment. This is being achieved through employment of technologies such as satellite-derived information and advanced telemetry instruments that provide real-time in situ profile data from the water column.},

  abstract = {Background We recently described a multilocus sequence typing scheme for Achromobacter that identified several novel species in this genus. Methods We assessed the ability of nrdA sequence analysis to differentiate Achromobacter species, including the seven previously named species and 14 recently described genogroups. Confirmation of distinctness between groups was confirmed using the k parameter. Using this single locus sequence to differentiate species, we analyzed Achromobacter isolates obtained from 341 CF patients in the U.S. Results We found that Achromobacter xylosoxidans accounts for 42\% of Achromobacter infections, while Achromobacter ruhlandii accounted for 23.5\% of infections. Isolates from 17\% of patients were members of the novel genogroup 14. The remaining 17.5\% of strains belonged to 11 other species/genogroups. Conclusion The use of nrdA sequence analysis allows differentiation of the several Achromobacter species that can infect persons with CF. Achromobacter species other than A. xylosoxidans account for the majority of Achromobacter infection in CF patients in the U.S.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms pose a risk to wild and domestic animals as well as humans due to the toxins they may produce. Humans may be subjected to cyanobacterial toxins through many routes, e.g., by consuming contaminated drinking water, fish, and crop plants or through recreational activities. In earlier studies, cyanobacterial cells have been shown to accumulate on leafy plants after spray irrigation with cyanobacteria-containing water, and microcystin (MC) has been detected in the plant root system after irrigation with MC-containing water. This paper reports a series of experiments where lysis of cyanobacteria in abstracted lake water was induced by the use of hydrogen peroxide and the fate of released MCs was followed. The hydrogen peroxide–treated water was then used for spray irrigation of cultivated spinach and possible toxin accumulation in the plants was monitored. The water abstracted from Lake Köyliönjärvi, SW Finland, contained fairly low concentrations of intracellular MC prior to the hydrogen peroxide treatment (0.04~μg~L−1 in July to 2.4~μg~L−1 in September 2014). Hydrogen peroxide at sufficient doses was able to lyse cyanobacteria efficiently but released MCs were still present even after the application of the highest hydrogen peroxide dose of 20~mg~L−1. No traces of MC were detected in the spinach leaves. The viability of moving phytoplankton and zooplankton was also monitored after the application of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide at 10~mg~L−1 or higher had a detrimental effect on the moving phytoplankton and zooplankton.},

  abstract = {Environmental waters are monitored for fecal pollution to protect public health and water resources. Traditionally, general fecal-indicator bacteria are used; however, they cannot distinguish human fecal waste from other animal pollution sources. Recently, a novel bacteriophage, crAssphage, was discovered by metagenomic data mining and reported to be abundant in and closely associated with human fecal waste. To confirm bioinformatic predictions, 384 primer sets were designed along the length of the crAssphage genome. Based on initial screening, two novel crAssphage qPCR assays (CPQ\_056 and CPQ\_064) were designed and evaluated in reference fecal samples and water matrices. The assays exhibited high specificities (98.6\%) when tested against an animal fecal reference library, and crAssphage genetic markers were highly abundant in raw sewage and sewage-impacted water samples. In addition, CPQ\_056 and CPQ\_064 performance was compared to HF183/BacR287 and HumM2 assays in paired experiments. Findings confirm that viral crAssphage qPCR assays perform at a similar level to well-established bacterial human-associated fecal-source-identification approaches. These new viral-based assays could become important water quality management and research tools.,},

In particular, the unusually high affinity of marine and terrestrial AOA for ammonia indicates that this group may determine the oxidation state of nitrogen available to associated micro- and macrobiota, altering our current understanding of trophic interactions. Initial comparative genomics and physiological studies have revealed a novel, and as yet unresolved, primarily copper-based pathway for ammonia oxidation and respiration distinct from that of known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and possibly relevant to the production of atmospherically active nitrogen oxides. Comparative studies also provide compelling evidence that the lineage of Archaea with which the AOA affiliate is sufficiently divergent to justify the creation of a novel phylum, the Thaumarchaeota.},

  abstract = {Taxonomic characterization of environmental microbial communities via high-throughput DNA sequencing has revealed that patterns in microbial biogeography affect community structure. However, shifts in functional diversity related to variation in taxonomic composition are poorly understood. To overcome limitations due to the prohibitive cost of high-depth metagenomic sequencing, tools to infer functional diversity based on phylogenetic distributions of functional traits have been developed. In this study we characterized functional microbial diversity at 11 sites along the Mississippi River in Minnesota using both metagenomic sequencing and functional-inference-based (PICRUSt) approaches. This allowed us to determine how distance and variation in land cover throughout the river influenced the distribution of functional traits, as well as to validate PICRUSt inferences. The distribution and abundance of functional traits, by metagenomic analysis, were similar among sites, with a median standard deviation of 0.0002\% among tier 3 functions in KEGG. Overall inferred functional variation was significantly different (P ≤ 0.035) between two water basins surrounded by agricultural vs. developed land cover, and abundances of bacterial orders that correlated with functional traits by metagenomic analysis were greater where abundances of the trait were inferred to be higher. PICRUSt inferences were significantly correlated (r = 0.147, P = 1.80 × 10−30) with metagenomic annotations. Discrepancies between metagenomic and PICRUSt taxonomic-functional relationships, however, suggested potential functional redundancy among abundant and rare taxa that impeded the ability to accurately assess unique functional traits among rare taxa at this sequencing depth. Results of this study suggest that a suite of “core functional traits” is conserved throughout the river and distributions of functional traits, rather than specific taxa, may shift in response to environmental heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Significant rates of primary production occur in the oligotrophic ocean, without any measurable nutrients present in the mixed layer, fueling a scientific paradox that has lasted for decades. Here, we provide a new determination of the annual mean physical supply of nitrate to the euphotic zone in the western subtropical North Atlantic. We combine a 3-year time series of measurements of tritiugenic 3He from 2003 to 2006 in the surface ocean at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site with a sophisticated noble gas calibrated air–sea gas exchange model to constrain the 3He flux across the sea–air interface, which must closely mirror the upward 3He flux into the euphotic zone. The product of the 3He flux and the observed subsurface nitrate–3He relationship provides an estimate of the minimum rate of new production in the BATS region. We also apply the gas model to an earlier time series of 3He measurements at BATS in order to recalculate new production fluxes for the 1985 to 1988 time period. The observations, despite an almost 3-fold difference in the nitrate–3He relationship, yield a roughly consistent estimate of nitrate flux. In particular, the nitrate flux from 2003 to 2006 is estimated to be 0.65 ± 0.14 mol m−2 yr−1, which is \textasciitilde 40 \% smaller than the calculated flux for the period from 1985 to 1988. The difference in nitrate flux between the time periods may be signifying a real difference in new production resulting from changes in subtropical mode water formation. Overall, the nitrate flux is larger than most estimates of export fluxes or net community production fluxes made locally for the BATS site, which is likely a reflection of the larger spatial scale covered by the 3He technique and potentially also by the decoupling of 3He and nitrate during the obduction of water masses from the main thermocline into the upper ocean. The upward nitrate flux is certainly large enough to support observed rates of primary production at BATS and more generally in the oligotrophic subtropical ocean.},

In some systems atmospheric inputs and exchanges with coastal waters can also be important. Climate change will affect nutrient inputs and behaviour through modifications to temperature, wind patterns, the hydrological cycle, and sea level rise. Resulting impacts include: 1) inundation of freshwater systems 2) changes in stratification, flushing times and phytoplankton productivity 3) increased coastal storm activity 4) changes in species and ecosystem function. A combination of continuing high inputs of nutrients through human activity and climate change is anticipated to lead to enhanced eutrophication in the future.

  abstract = {We review the salient evidence consistent with or predicted by the Hoyle-Wickramasinghe (H-W) thesis of Cometary (Cosmic) Biology. Much of this physical and biological evidence is multifactorial. One particular focus are the recent studies which date the emergence of the complex retroviruses of vertebrate lines at or just before the Cambrian Explosion of ∼500 Ma. Such viruses are known to be plausibly associated with major evolutionary genomic processes. We believe this coincidence is not fortuitous but is consistent with a key prediction of H-W theory whereby major extinction-diversification evolutionary boundaries coincide with virus-bearing cometary-bolide bombardment events. A second focus is the remarkable evolution of intelligent complexity (Cephalopods) culminating in the emergence of the Octopus. A third focus concerns the micro-organism fossil evidence contained within meteorites as well as the detection in the upper atmosphere of apparent incoming life-bearing particles from space. In our view the totality of the multifactorial data and critical analyses assembled by Fred Hoyle, Chandra Wickramasinghe and their many colleagues since the 1960s leads to a very plausible conclusion – life may have been seeded here on Earth by life-bearing comets as soon as conditions on Earth allowed it to flourish (about or just before 4.1 Billion years ago); and living organisms such as space-resistant and space-hardy bacteria, viruses, more complex eukaryotic cells, fertilised ova and seeds have been continuously delivered ever since to Earth so being one important driver of further terrestrial evolution which has resulted in considerable genetic diversity and which has led to the emergence of mankind.},

  abstract = {Microbes are central to ocean food webs and global biogeochemical processes. Understanding their distribution and interactions over space and time is fundamental to understanding their ecology. Even with the advent of molecular techniques, it is difficult to observe their interactions with each other and with their environment. We are in the early stages of expanding our focus from simply identifying microbes, to discovering what they are doing (i.e. how each microorganism interacts and fits within the functioning of the ecosystem). In the ocean, which is in constant lateral and vertical motion, these community patterns and interactions may change on short to medium spatial and temporal scales. The aim of this study was to determine the community patterns in bacterioplankton in the ocean surface waters on hour-day temporal scales and kilometer spatial scales, patterns in bacterial communities on μm to m depth scales, and interactions among bacteria, protists and Archaea on monthly scales. Molecular fingerprinting techniques coupled with clone libraries for identification were used to study changes in bacterioplankton communities in the surface waters from 2000-2005, in the sea surface microlayer and surface layer from 2004-2006, and interactions between bacterioplankton and protists from 2000-2004 in the ocean near Southern California. Investigating bacterioplankton community patterns over km spatial scales and hour-day temporal scales, we found coherent communities at 2-97km 2 area scales and at distances along transects of 0-15km, and the major taxa appeared remarkably consistent throughout, while at distances from 50-255km, there were strong differences in the communities which correlated to environmental parameters. Temporally, we found stable communities within a water patch and in the surface mixed layer over 20-30 hours, and also high community similarity between days over a week at a single geographic location. Together, these results suggest that in the Southern California Bight, a typical 10L oceanographic sample can represent a bacterioplankton community on the scale of 10-100km 2 and 4-6 days. Investigating the communities in the sea surface microlayer compared to the communities at 0.5m depth, our results showed a sea surface microlayer community which was distinct from the bacterial community at 0.5m depth in some locations, but showed no difference between the communities at others. We found low and variable enrichment and depletion of bacteria and viruses and strong depletion of bacterial production in the microlayer. The wide range of similarities found between the sea surface microlayer and the underlying water communities and the high number of shared taxa between the communities, suggests a patchy microlayer community that is likely formed by bacteria being transported from the surface waters to the microlayer. Using a network to visualize the statistical correlations between co-occurrence of bacteria, archaea, and protists, along with viruses and other environmental factors in a microbial community over 3 years suggested a succession of microbial communities and identified possible local ecotypes of groups like the SAR11 cluster, Stramenopiles, Alveolates, Cyanobacteria, and microphagotrophs (e.g. ciliates and choanoflagellates). This new approach provides a feel for the natural history of microbes, and should facilitate the inclusion of complex microbial assemblages in community ecology studies; it also points to biogeochemical roles of "unknown" microorganisms, and indicates possible keystone species. These studies provide a solid addition to a more complete understanding of bacterioplankton biogeography and their ecological roles; and will provide insight into the function and response of the bacterioplankton ecosystem in the surface waters.},

  abstract = {Crossing the boundaries in global sustainability The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability policy development. Steffen et al. provide an updated and extended analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries, they identify three (including climate change) that might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1259855 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTION There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened. RATIONALE The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES—its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low—a “safe operating space” for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure). RESULTS Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier “biodiversity loss”), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs—climate change and biosphere integrity—are recognized as “core” PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth’s surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure). CONCLUSIONS PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development. View larger version: In this window In a new window Download PowerPoint Slide for Teaching Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary boundaries. The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO2 concentration. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity. The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries—climate change and biosphere integrity—have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.},

  abstract = {The downward flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) decreases significantly in the ocean's mesopelagic or 'twilight' zone due both to abiotic processes and metabolism by resident biota. Bacteria and zooplankton solubilize and consume POC to support their metabolism, but the relative importance of bacteria vs. zooplankton in the consumption of sinking particles in the twilight zone is unknown. We compared losses of sinking POC, using differences in export flux measured by neutrally buoyant sediment traps at a range of depths, with bacteria and zooplankton metabolic requirements at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series station ALOHA in the subtropical Pacific and the Japanese times-series site K2 in the subarctic Pacific. Integrated (150-1,000 m) mesopelagic bacterial C demand exceeded that of zooplankton by up to 3-fold at ALOHA, while bacteria and zooplankton required relatively equal amounts of POC at K2. However, sinking POC flux was inadequate to meet metabolic demands at either site. Mesopelagic bacterial C demand was 3- to 4-fold (ALOHA), and 10-fold (K2) greater than the loss of sinking POC flux, while zooplankton C demand was 1- to 2-fold (ALOHA), and 3- to 9-fold (K2) greater (using our "middle" estimate conversion factors to calculate C demand). Assuming the particle flux estimates are accurate, we posit that this additional C demand must be met by diel vertical migration of zooplankton feeding at the surface and by carnivory at depth--with both processes ultimately supplying organic C to mesopelagic bacteria. These pathways need to be incorporated into biogeochemical models that predict global C sequestration in the deep sea.},

  abstract = {The Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) commenced monthly sampling in October 1988 as part of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) program. The goals of the US JGOFS time-series research are to better understand the basic processes that control ocean biogeochemistry on seasonal to decadal time-scales, determine the role of the oceans in the global carbon budget, and ultimately improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on ecosystems. The BATS program samples the ocean on a biweekly to monthly basis, a strategy that resolves major seasonal patterns and interannual variability. The core cruises last 4-5 d during which hydrography, nutrients, particle flux, pigments and primary production, bacterioplankton abundance and production, and often complementary ancillary measurements are made. This overview focuses on patterns in ocean biology and biogeochemistry over a decade at the BATS site, concentrating on seasonal and interannual changes in community structure, and the physical forcing and other factors controlling the temporal dynamics. Significant seasonal and interannual variability in phytoplankton and bacterioplankton production, biomass, and community structure exists at BATS. No strong relationship exists between primary production and particle flux during the 10 yr record, with the relationship slightly improved by applying an artificial lag of 1 week between production and flux. The prokaryotic picoplankton regularly dominate the phytoplankton community; diatom blooms are rare but occur periodically in the BATS time series. The increase in Chi a concentrations during bloom periods is due to increases by most of the taxa present, rather than by any single group, and there is seasonal succession of phytoplankton. The bacterioplankton often dominate the living biomass, indicating the potential to consume large amounts of carbon and play a major ecological role within the microbial food web. Bacterial biomass, production, and specific growth rates are highest during summer. Size structure and composition of the plankton community may be an important factor controlling the quality of dissolved organic matter produced and could affect production of bacterioplankton biomass. Larger heterotrophic plankton play an integral role in the flux of material out of the euphotic zone at BATS. Protozoans are abundant and can constitute a sizable component of sinking flux. Zooplankton contribute significantly to flux via production of rapidly sinking fecal pellets, and vertically migrating zooplankton can actively transport a significant amount of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon and nitrogen to deep water. An important question that remains to be further addressed at BATS is how larger climatological events drive some of the interannual variability in the biogeochemistry.

We explore current knowledge of the processing of zooplankton food ingestion by absorption, egestion, respiration, excretion, and growth (production) processes. On a global scale, carbon fluxes are reasonably constrained by the grazing impact of microzooplankton and the respiratory requirements of mesozooplankton but are sensitive to uncertainties in trophic structure. The relative importance, combined magnitude, and efficiency of export mechanisms (mucous feeding webs, fecal pellets, molts, carcasses, and vertical migrations) likewise reflect regional variability in community structure.

  abstract = {The least known component of the “biological pump” is the active transport of carbon and nutrients by diel vertical migration of zooplankton. We measured CO2 respiration and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) excretion by individual species of common vertically migrating zooplankton at the US JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) station. The inclusion of DOC excretion in this study builds on published research on active transport by respiration of inorganic carbon and allows a direct assessment of the role of zooplankton in the production of dissolved organic matter used in midwater microbial processes. On average, excretion of DOC makes up 24\% (range=5–42\%) of the total C metabolized (excreted+respired) and could represent a significant augmentation to the vertical flux that has already been documented for respiratory CO2 flux by migrant zooplankton. Migratory fluxes were compared to other transport processes at BATS. Estimates of combined active transport of CO2 and DOC by migrators at BATS averaged 7.8\% and reached 38.6\% of mean sinking POC flux at 150 m, and reached 71.4\% of mean sinking POC flux at 300 m. DOC export by migrator excretion averaged 1.9\% and reached 13.3\% of annual DOC export by physical mixing at this site. During most of the year when deep mixing does not occur, diel migration by zooplankton could provide a supply of DOC to the deeper layers that is available for use by the microbial community. A carbon budget comparing migrant zooplankton transport to the balance of fluxes in the 300–600 m depth strata at BATS shows on average that the total migrant flux supplies 37\% of the organic carbon remineralized in this layer, and that migrant DOC flux is more than 3 times the DOC flux gradient by diapycnal mixing. New estimates of active transport of both organic and inorganic carbon by migrants may help resolve observed imbalances in the C budget at BATS, but the magnitude is highly dependent on the biomass of the migrating community.},

  abstract = {In the past decade a series of studies have shown that the active transport of inorganic carbon and nutrients by diel vertical migration of zooplankton is an important component of the biological pump. Less well known is how excretion of dissolved organic material (DOM) by migrating zooplankton enhances this export by creating a migratory DOM pump. We measured ammonia (NH4+) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) excretion by common vertically migrating zooplankton at the US JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) station in the Sargasso Sea. The inclusion of DON excretion in our study builds on published research on migratory transport and excretion of NH4+ and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at BATS. On average, excretion of DON by migrating organisms is 32\% (range=15–66\%) of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) excreted, significantly augmenting previously documented vertical flux of inorganic nitrogen by migrant zooplankton. This process is discussed in the context of the BATS region, where TDN transport by migratory zooplankton is compared to nitrogen export via sinking of PON and to primary production. Estimates of active transport of TDN (NH4++DON) by migrators averaged 13\%, 18\%, and 27\% of the mean monthly sinking PON flux (for the period 1989–1999) at 150, 200, and 300 m, respectively. However, maximum transport of TDN by migrators was from 1.6 to 3.5 times greater than the sinking PON flux at these three depths. On average, the migratory TDN flux was a small proportion (2\%) of primary production, but reached a maximum of 19\%. Comparison of N excretion data from this study with C and P metabolism data from our other studies in the region indicates that molar remineralization ratios of C, N, and P by migrators differ among species and are not always at the classic Redfield ratio. This may have implications for non-Redfield cycling of nutrients in the western Sargasso Sea.},

  abstract = {The largest decrease in the particle vertical flux occurs in the mesopelagic zone where particles are transformed by biological and physical mechanisms. Particle size distributions provide important clues into those processes affecting particle transformations in this region. We have studied them using an inter-annual data set showing the evolution of particle size distributions between 100 and 1000 m, comparing them to results from a series of size-resolved models of particle dynamics that include physical coagulation and biological remineralization. The formulation that best fits the observations consists of a combination of settling, microbial activity and zooplankton feeding. The calculated particulate organic carbon losses to microbial activity and zooplankton feeding are consistent with independent estimates of these rates. The model shows that it is possible to predict the particle size distribution at 1000 m depth knowing the particle size distribution at 100 m depth and the rates of transformation in the mesopelagic. The mesozooplankton appears to be important in decreasing the high flux of large particles in the upper midwater zone, microbes becomes more important in the deeper midwater zone as zooplankton become rarer. The results suggest that the mesozooplankton have a much greater effect on particle flux than the macrozooplankton. Their importance requires the mesozooplankton to feed preferentially on large settling particles, probably using remote detection. The present work shows that using particle size spectra is a useful way to understand the transformation of the vertical flux of element in the midwater zone.

  abstract = {The downward transport of surface particle production constitutes an important mechanism for carbon sequestration by the ocean. Only a small fraction (≃10\%) of the flux that leaves the euphotic zone reaches 1000m depth because the particulate organic matter is consumed and transformed in the oceanic midwater column. The depth at which this transformation occurs is crucial to estimate carbon sequestration. Description of the particle flux and remineralization with depth below the euphotic zone has previously been limited to empirical relationships that neglect physical and biological mechanisms. Because several particle properties and functions (settling speed, rates of coagulation and consumption) are related to particle size, measurements of particle size spectra provide an important tool to understand particle dynamics. Most of the mechanisms affecting particle dynamics known for the surface layer should continue in the mesopelagic region. We review the different mechanisms and formulate equations describing changes in particle size distributions throughout the water column as a result of particle sinking, coagulation, disaggregation, and bacterial and zooplankton consumption. The resulting model describes the midwater particle population by its mass distribution for the size range 1μm to 1cm. Most of the particle data sets have a narrower size range but we suggest that model results are not greatly affected by the lack of data on particles smaller than 200μm because most of the particle mass is in particles larger than 100μm, as seen in a full size-range particle spectrum. The combination of this model with a unique particle size spectra data set, obtained during an inter-annual survey at the French JGOFS site in the NW Mediterranean Sea, give an insight into the key processes for particle dynamics in the unknown midwater layers.},

  abstract = {The bacteria that can be grown in the laboratory are only a small fraction of the total diversity that exists in nature. At all levels of bacterial phylogeny, uncultured clades that do not grow on standard media are playing critical roles in cycling carbon, nitrogen, and other elements, synthesizing novel natural products, and impacting the surrounding organisms and environment. While molecular techniques, such as metagenomic sequencing, can provide some information independent of our ability to culture these organisms, it is essentially impossible to learn new gene and pathway functions from pure sequence data. A true understanding of the physiology of these bacteria and their roles in ecology, host health, and natural product production requires their cultivation in the laboratory. Recent advances in growing these species include coculture with other bacteria, recreating the environment in the laboratory, and combining these approaches with microcultivation technology to increase throughput and access rare species. These studies are unraveling the molecular mechanisms of unculturability and are identifying growth factors that promote the growth of previously unculturable organisms. This minireview summarizes the recent discoveries in this area and discusses the potential future of the field.},

  abstract = {In the world’s oceans, even relatively low oxygen levels inhibit anaerobic nitrogen cycling by free-living microbes. Sinking organic aggregates, however, might provide oxygen-depleted microbial hotspots in otherwise oxygenated surface waters. Here, we show that sinking diatom aggregates can host anaerobic nitrogen cycling at ambient oxygen levels well above the hypoxic threshold. Aggregates were produced from the ubiquitous diatom Skeletonema marinoi and the natural microbial community of seawater. Microsensor profiling through the center of sinking aggregates revealed internal anoxia at ambient 40\% air saturation (∼100 µmol O2 L−1) and below. Accordingly, anaerobic nitrate turnover inside the aggregates was evident within this range of ambient oxygen levels. In incubations with 15N-labeled nitrate, individual Skeletonema aggregates produced NO2− (up to 10.7 nmol N h−1 per aggregate), N2 (up to 7.1 nmol N h−1), NH4+ (up to 2.0 nmol N h−1), and N2O (up to 0.2 nmol N h−1). Intriguingly, nitrate stored inside the diatom cells served as an additional, internal nitrate source for dinitrogen production, which may partially uncouple anaerobic nitrate turnover by diatom aggregates from direct ambient nitrate supply. Sinking diatom aggregates can contribute directly to fixed-nitrogen loss in low-oxygen environments in the ocean and vastly expand the ocean volume in which anaerobic nitrogen turnover is possible, despite relatively high ambient oxygen levels. Depending on the extent of intracellular nitrate consumption during the sinking process, diatom aggregates may also be involved in the long-distance export of nitrate to the deep ocean.},

  abstract = {Intuitively, it may seem that from the perspective of an individual bacterium the ocean is a vast, dilute, and largely homogeneous environment. Microbial oceanographers have typically considered the ocean from this point of view. In reality, marine bacteria inhabit a chemical seascape that is highly heterogeneous down to the microscale, owing to ubiquitous nutrient patches, plumes, and gradients. Exudation and excretion of dissolved matter by larger organisms, lysis events, particles, animal surfaces, and fluxes from the sediment-water interface all contribute to create strong and pervasive heterogeneity, where chemotaxis may provide a significant fitness advantage to bacteria. The dynamic nature of the ocean imposes strong selective pressures on bacterial foraging strategies, and many marine bacteria indeed display adaptations that characterize their chemotactic motility as “high performance” compared to that of enteric model organisms. Fast swimming speeds, strongly directional responses, and effective turning and steering strategies ensure that marine bacteria can successfully use chemotaxis to very rapidly respond to chemical gradients in the ocean. These fast responses are advantageous in a broad range of ecological processes, including attaching to particles, exploiting particle plumes, retaining position close to phytoplankton cells, colonizing host animals, and hovering at a preferred height above the sediment-water interface. At larger scales, these responses can impact ocean biogeochemistry by increasing the rates of chemical transformation, influencing the flux of sinking material, and potentially altering the balance of biomass incorporation versus respiration. This review highlights the physical and ecological processes underpinning bacterial motility and chemotaxis in the ocean, describes the current state of knowledge of chemotaxis in marine bacteria, and summarizes our understanding of how these microscale dynamics scale up to affect ecosystem-scale processes in the sea.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

These time series reveal vertical expansion of the intermediate-depth low-oxygen zones in the eastern tropical Atlantic and the equatorial Pacific during the past 50 years. The oxygen decrease in the 300- to 700-m layer is 0.09 to 0.34 micromoles per kilogram per year. Reduced oxygen levels may have dramatic consequences for ecosystems and coastal economies. Since the 1950s, dissolved oxygen concentrations have decreased in low-oxygen zones of the tropical Atlantic and equatorial Pacific, and the zones have expanded toward the surface.

Rates of phytoplankton growth (range: 0.09–2.69 day−1) and microzooplankton grazing (range: 0.00–2.10 day−1) varied seasonally, with lowest values in late fall and winter, and highest values in spring and summer. Chlorophyll concentrations also varied widely (0.19–13.65 μg l−1). Large ({$>$}8 μm) phytoplankton cells consistently dominated phytoplankton communities under bloom conditions, contributing on average 65\% of total chlorophyll biomass when chlorophyll exceeded 2 μg l−1. Microzooplankton grazing was an important loss process affecting phytoplankton, with grazing rates equivalent to nearly two-thirds (64\%) of growth rates on average. Both small and large phytoplankton cells were consumed, with the ratio of grazing to growth (g:μ) for the two size classes averaging 0.80 and 0.42, respectively. Perhaps surprisingly, the coupling between microzooplankton grazing and phytoplankton growth was tighter during phytoplankton blooms than during low biomass periods, with g:μ averaging 0.78 during blooms and 0.49 at other times. This tight coupling may be a result of the high potential growth and ingestion rates of protist grazers, some of which feed on bloom-forming diatoms and other large phytoplankton. Large ciliates and Gyrodinium-like dinoflagellates contributed substantially to microzooplankton biomass at diatom bloom stations in the Gulf of Alaska, and microzooplankton biomass overall was strongly correlated with {$>$}8 μm chlorophyll concentrations. Because grazing tended to be proportionally greater when phytoplankton biomass was high, the absolute amount of chlorophyll consumed by microzooplankton was often substantial. In nearly two-thirds of the experiments (14/23), more chlorophyll was ingested by microzooplankton than was available for all other biological and physical loss processes combined. Microzooplankton were important intermediaries in the transfer of primary production to higher trophic levels in these coastal marine food webs.},

It comprises a wide class of particles created by such diverse processes as cell death, egestion, and aggregation. Detrital particles span several orders of magnitude in size and have distinctly different chemical and physical properties. As a consequence, the propensity of detrital particles to serve as substrates for bacteria or grazers, passive particles drifting through the ocean, or conduits for rapid flux into the deep ocean is highly variable. In this chapter, we review the diverse nature of detrital particles and corresponding production and loss terms in the pelagic ocean, as well as current attempts to include detritus in ecological and biogeochemical models. Our goal is to bridge the gap between field experiments and modeling studies by highlighting properties of detritus that vary predictably between classes and can be both measured in the field and incorporated into the next generation of pelagic ecosystem models.},

  abstract = {Enhanced vertical carbon transport (gravitational sinking and subduction) at mesoscale ocean fronts may explain the demonstrated imbalance of new production and sinking particle export in coastal upwelling ecosystems. Based on flux assessments from 238U:234Th disequilibrium and sediment traps, we found 2 to 3 times higher rates of gravitational particle export near a deep-water front (305 mg C⋅m−2⋅d−1) compared with adjacent water or to mean (nonfrontal) regional conditions. Elevated particle flux at the front was mechanistically linked to Fe-stressed diatoms and high mesozooplankton fecal pellet production. Using a data assimilative regional ocean model fit to measured conditions, we estimate that an additional ∼225 mg C⋅m−2⋅d−1 was exported as subduction of particle-rich water at the front, highlighting a transport mechanism that is not captured by sediment traps and is poorly quantified by most models and in situ measurements. Mesoscale fronts may be responsible for over a quarter of total organic carbon sequestration in the California Current and other coastal upwelling ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Oceanographic field programs often use δ15N biogeochemical measurements and in situ rate measurements to investigate nitrogen cycling and planktonic ecosystem structure. However, integrative modeling approaches capable of synthesizing these distinct measurement types are lacking. We develop a novel approach for incorporating δ15N isotopic data into existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) random walk methods for solving linear inverse ecosystem models. We test the ability of this approach to recover food web indices (nitrate uptake, nitrogen fixation, zooplankton trophic level, and secondary production) derived from forward models simulating the planktonic ecosystems of the California Current and Amazon River Plume. We show that the MCMC with δ15N approach typically does a better job of recovering ecosystem structure than the standard MCMC or L2 minimum norm (L2MN) approaches, and also outperforms an L2MN with δ15N approach. Furthermore, we find that the MCMC with δ15N approach is robust to the removal of input equations and hence is well suited to typical pelagic ecosystem studies for which the system is usually vastly under-constrained. Our approach is easily extendable for use with δ13C isotopic measurements or variable carbon:nitrogen stoichiometry.},

  abstract = {Zooplankton are important consumers of sinking particles in the ocean’s twilight zone. However, the impact of different taxa depends on their feeding mode. In contrast to typical suspension-feeding zooplankton, flux-feeding taxa preferentially consume rapidly-sinking particles that would otherwise penetrate into the deep ocean. To quantify the potential impact of two flux-feeding zooplankton taxa (Aulosphaeridae [Rhizaria], and Limacina helicina [euthecosome pteropod]) and the total suspension-feeding zooplankton community, we measured depth-stratified abundances of these organisms during six cruises in the California Current Ecosystem. Using allometric-scaling relationships, we computed the percentage of carbon flux intercepted by flux feeders and suspension feeders. These estimates were compared to direct measurements of carbon flux attenuation made using drifting sediment traps and 238U-234Th disequilibrium. We found that carbon flux attenuation in the shallow twilight zone typically ranged from 500 – 1000 µmol organic C flux remineralized per 10-m vertical depth bin. This equated to approximately 6 – 10\% of carbon flux remineralized / 10 m. The two flux-feeding taxa considered in this study could account for a substantial proportion of this flux near the base of the euphotic zone. The mean flux attenuation attributable to Aulosphaeridae was 0.69\% / 10 m (median = 0.21\%/10 m, interquartile range = 0.04 – 0.81\%) at their depth of maximum abundance (\textasciitilde 100 m), which would equate to \textasciitilde{} 10\% of total flux attenuation in this depth range. The maximum flux attenuation attributable to Aulosphaeridae reached 4.2\% / 10 m when these protists were most abundant. L. helicina, meanwhile, could intercept 0.45 – 1.6\% of carbon flux / 10 m, which was slightly greater (on average) than the Aulosphaeridae. In contrast, suspension-feeding zooplankton in the mesopelagic (including copepods, euphausiids, appendicularians, and ostracods) had combined clearance rates of 2–81 L m-3 d-1 (mean of 19.6 L m-3 d-1). This implies a substantial impact on slowly sinking particles, but a negligible impact on the presumably rapidly-sinking fecal pellets that comprised the majority of the material collected in sediment traps. Our results highlight the need for a greater research focus on the many taxa that potentially act as flux feeders in the oceanic twilight zone.},

  abstract = {Hydrogels are used as scaffolds for tissue engineering, vehicles for drug delivery, actuators for optics and fluidics, and model extracellular matrices for biological studies. The scope of hydrogel applications, however, is often severely limited by their mechanical behaviour. Most hydrogels do not exhibit high stretchability; for example, an alginate hydrogel ruptures when stretched to about 1.2 times its original length. Some synthetic elastic hydrogels have achieved stretches in the range 10-20, but these values are markedly reduced in samples containing notches. Most hydrogels are brittle, with fracture energies of about 10\,J\,m-2 (ref. 8), as compared with [sim]1,000\,J\,m-2 for cartilage and [sim]10,000\,J\,m-2 for natural rubbers. Intense efforts are devoted to synthesizing hydrogels with improved mechanical properties; certain synthetic gels have reached fracture energies of 100-1,000\,J\,m-2 (refs 11, 14, 17). Here we report the synthesis of hydrogels from polymers forming ionically and covalently crosslinked networks. Although such gels contain [sim]90\% water, they can be stretched beyond 20 times their initial length, and have fracture energies of [sim]9,000\,J\,m-2. Even for samples containing notches, a stretch of 17 is demonstrated. We attribute the gels/' toughness to the synergy of two mechanisms: crack bridging by the network of covalent crosslinks, and hysteresis by unzipping the network of ionic crosslinks. Furthermore, the network of covalent crosslinks preserves the memory of the initial state, so that much of the large deformation is removed on unloading. The unzipped ionic crosslinks cause internal damage, which heals by re-zipping. These gels may serve as model systems to explore mechanisms of deformation and energy dissipation, and expand the scope of hydrogel applications.},

Gardner (Limnol Oceanogr, 22, 764–768, 1977) demonstrated that particles sink into the space below the spout of Niskin bottles on timescales relevant to sample processing. We examined this effect on measurements of microbial abundance, community composition, and transparent stainable particles across an oxygen-sulfide gradient in the Cariaco Basin. Within 1 h, modestly sized micro-aggregates ({$>$} 16 μm) were not detected in samples drawn from the spout, but were abundant in the waters below the spout. Total transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and Coomassie stainable particles (CSP) were at least twice as abundant in the below-spout samples as in spout-collected water. Below-spout samples accounted for four times more total particle surface area per mL than spout samples. Approximately 10\% of all microbes were particle-associated, which led to only small enrichments of total microbes in the below-spout samples. However, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed five of seven clades surveyed were significantly more enriched in water below the spout than total cells, indicating (1) a small bias when enumerating total particles and microbes from spout samples and (2) a very strong bias for particular phylogenetic groups that are more prevalent on particles than the total community. In particular, sulfate-reducing δ-proteobacteria were consistently enriched in below-spout samples collected at depths along the oxygen-sulfide transition. Abundance of this functional group has potentially been underestimated in the past. Consequently, microbial diversity results derived from Niskin bottle samples should be cautiously applied when interpreting biogeochemical cycling.},

  abstract = {A number of social-ecological systems exhibit complex behaviour associated with nonlinearities, bifurcations, and interaction with stochastic drivers. These systems are often prone to abrupt and unexpected instabilities and state shifts that emerge as a discontinuous response to gradual changes in environmental drivers. Predicting such behaviours is crucial to the prevention of or preparation for unwanted regime shifts. Recent research in ecology has investigated early warning signs that anticipate the divergence of univariate ecosystem dynamics from a stable attractor. To date, leading indicators of instability in systems with multiple interacting components have remained poorly investigated. This is a major limitation in the understanding of the dynamics of complex social-ecological networks. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to demonstrate that rising variance—measured, for example, by the maximum element of the covariance matrix of the network—is an effective leading indicator of network instability. We show that its reliability and robustness depend more on the sign of the interactions within the network than the network structure or noise intensity. Mutualistic, scale free and small world networks are less stable than their antagonistic or random counterparts but their instability is more reliably predicted by this leading indicator. These results provide new advances in multidimensional early warning analysis and offer a framework to evaluate the resilience of social-ecological networks.},

  abstract = {Much advancement has been made in recent years in field data assimilation, remote sensing and ecosystem modeling, yet our global view of phytoplankton biogeography beyond chlorophyll biomass is still a cursory taxonomic picture with vast areas of the open ocean requiring field validations. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment data combined with inverse methods offer an advantage over many other phytoplankton quantification measures by way of providing an immediate perspective of the whole phytoplankton community in a sample as a function of chlorophyll biomass. Historically, such chemotaxonomic analysis has been conducted mainly at local spatial and temporal scales in the ocean. Here, we apply a widely tested inverse approach, CHEMTAX, to a global climatology of pigment observations from HPLC. This study marks the first systematic and objective global application of CHEMTAX, yielding a seasonal climatology comprised of \textasciitilde 1500 1°×1° global grid points of the major phytoplankton pigment types in the ocean characterizing cyanobacteria, haptophytes, chlorophytes, cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, and diatoms, with results validated against prior regional studies where possible. Key findings from this new global view of specific phytoplankton abundances from pigments are a) the large global proportion of marine haptophytes (comprising 32±5\% of total chlorophyll), whose biogeochemical functional roles are relatively unknown, and b) the contrasting spatial scales of complexity in global community structure that can be explained in part by regional oceanographic conditions. The results are publically accessible via doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.855412, and will guide future parameterizations of marine ecosystem models exploring the link between phytoplankton community structure and marine biogeochemical cycles.},

Using single-cell sorting and whole-genome amplification of prokaryotes from two subtropical gyres, we obtained genomic DNA from 738 cells representing most cosmopolitan lineages. Multiple cells of Deltaproteobacteria cluster SAR324, Gammaproteobacteria clusters ARCTIC96BD-19 and Agg47, and some Oceanospirillales from the lower mesopelagic contained ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase and sulfur oxidation genes. These results corroborated community DNA and RNA profiling from diverse geographic regions. The SAR324 genomes also suggested C1 metabolism and a particle-associated life-style. Microautoradiography and fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed bicarbonate uptake and particle association of SAR324 cells. Our study suggests potential chemolithoautotrophy in several uncultured Proteobacteria lineages that are ubiquitous in the dark oxygenated ocean and provides new perspective on carbon cycling in the ocean’s largest habitat.},

  abstract = {A comparison of monthly biogeochemical measurements made from 1993 to 1995, combined with hydrography and satellite altimetry, was used to assess the impacts of nine eddy events on primary productivity and particle flux in the Sargasso Sea. Measurements of primary production, thorium-234 flux, nitrate+nitrite, and photosynthetic pigments made at the US JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site were used. During the 3 years of this study, four out of six high thorium-234 flux events occurred during the passage of an eddy. Primary production nearly as high as the spring bloom maximum was observed in two mode-water eddies (May 1993 and July 1995). The 1994 spring bloom at BATS was suppressed by the passage of an anticyclone. Distinct phytoplankton community shifts were observed in mode-water eddies, which had an increased percentage of diatoms and dinoflagellates, and in cyclones, which had an increased percentage of Synechococcus. These variations in species composition within mode-water eddies and cyclones may be associated with the ages of the sampled eddies, and/or differences in physical, chemical, and biological factors in these two distinct eddy types. In general, eddies that were 1–2 months old elicited a large biological response; eddies that were 3 months old may show a biological response and were accompanied by high thorium flux; eddies that were 4 months old or older did not show a biological response or high thorium flux. A conceptual model depicting temporal changes during eddy upwelling, maturation, and decay can explain the observations in all seven upwelling eddies present in the time-series investigated herein.},

  abstract = {A Floc Camera Assembly is used to obtain the in-situ size, shape, concentration and settling velocity of marine particles, providing insight into the in-situ excess-density, porosity and mass of flocs, their population characteristics, and aggregation and sedimentation rate. Data highlight the time-dependent character of marine snow, including near-instantaneous, daily and seasonal influences for a mid-latitude estuary, Halifax Inlet. Methods are developed for estimating the mean size of the constituent particles comprising flocs, for determining the number spectra of non-flocculated and flocculated particles, and for determining the mass concentration and mass flux spectra for suspended flocs. The most active aggregation level is just below the estuarine surface layer. The largest aggregation rates involve the finest ({$<$} 10 μm) suspended particles colliding by both differential settling and turbulent shear. During plankton blooms, large floes become attached to the mucoid stringers. The settling velocity of stringers is, in turn, controlled by these large floes attached to their base. Floc settling velocity varies with floc size, and as a seasonally-variable power function. A floc's excess density also varies with floc size, but the relationship changes daily. Floes account for between 36\% and 100\% of the total suspended mass within Halifax Inlet, and {$>$}90\% of the mass below the surface layer. Floc concentrations may change by a factor of four in just a few minutes, affected by the flux of larger floes. When river input of suspended load is high, floc concentration is also high, but the portion of total particulate matter composed of floc is low. Mean floc size varies considerably between seasons and sometimes between estuarine location. Small floes form when primary production is low and river input is high. Large flocs form when river input is very low. Suspended stringers are highest during the spring freshet and associated plankton bloom.},

  abstract = {Our objective was to track microbial processes associated with serial degradation of organic matter derived from algal blooms. To do this, we analyzed population fluctuations and growth responses of major phylogenetic groups of free-living marine bacteria. We used bromodeoxyuridine immunocytochemistry-fluorescence in situ hybridization methodology to examine marine bacterial community development during and after a diatom bloom in a mesocosm. We revealed that the Roseobacter/Rhodobacter, SAR11, Alteromonas, and Bacteroidetes groups were clearly major phylotypes responsible for most free-living bacterial biomass and production throughout the experiment. The clearest bacterial response was a proliferation of the Alteromonas group (cells with large volumes) during development of the bloom (up to 30 \% of actively growing cells). Populations of these bacteria declined sharply thereafter, likely due to grazing. Alteromonas group responses suggest that these bacteria strongly influenced the flux of organic matter at an early bloom stage. The growth potential of Bacteroidetes was relatively large as the bloom peaked; this early development probably contributed to the initial stage of bloom decomposition. In contrast, the contribution of Roseobacter/Rhodobacter to total bacterial production increased at a late stage of decomposing of the bloom. The contributions of Betaproteobacteria, SAR11, and SAR86 groups to total bacterial abundance and production were relatively minor throughout the experiment. These results imply that the ability to utilize organic matter derived from diatoms varies among bacterial phylotypes, and, frequently, less abundant but ecological specialist taxa such as Alteromonas may play major roles in the flux of organic matter during diatom blooms.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Heterotrophic bacteria contribute to controlling the oceans? biological carbon pump by solubilising organic particles and by using the dissolved organic matter for growth. To better understand how bacteria colonise and degrade vertically exported organic matter, spatial and temporal variations in the bacterial community composition (BCC) and cell-specific extracellular enzyme activity were investigated in water column samples and in sinking material collected by short-term deployed sediment traps in the Barents Sea (Arctic Ocean) and in a North-Norwegian fjord. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that both the suspended and sinking BCC differed among locations (Arctic Water, Atlantic Water and fjord) and with time (summer vs. autumn in the fjord). Within stations, the BCC differed between shallow (20 to 50 m) and deep (120 or 200 m) suspended samples. The sediment traps revealed no depth-related difference but had high similarity to the shallow suspended samples, indicating that the exported community largely derived from suspended particles in the upper mixed layer and that little new colonisation or succession of the resident community took place during transfer to depth. Bacteria in the sediment traps tended to have higher enzyme activities compared to suspended bacteria, likely reflecting a response to aggregation and different composition (carbon, nitrogen and chlorophyll) of suspended and sinking organic matter. While the present study demonstrates that particle export from the surface layer contributes to microbial diversity in the deep sea, future studies using high taxonomical resolution are required to further evaluate the importance of this dispersal pathway.},

  abstract = {Abundance and biomass of free-living bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates were measured monthly throughout the water column at the French-JGOFS time-series station DYFAMED in the NW Mediterranean Sea from May 1999 to March 2000. These microbial heterotrophs decreased by one, two and three orders of magnitude, respectively, over depth (5–2000 m). Vertical profiles were well described by the log–log linear regression (p\&lt;0.0001, t-test). Regardless of marked seasonality of environmental variables in the upper layer, the regression slope values (the index of magnitude of depth-dependent decrease) were relatively constant for each group. For 6 of the 9 months studied, the depth-dependent decreases of abundance and biomass were significantly smaller for bacteria than for protists (HNF and ciliates). This demonstrates that the balance between growth and loss processes is less variable for bacteria than for protists over depth. The magnitude of decrease was greater in ciliates than in HNF over depth (6 months for abundance and 5 months for biomass out of the 9 studied). The result suggests that the consortium of strict heterotrophic microbes becomes more dominant with increasing depth down to 2000 m. In the aphotic layer, the depth-dependent decrease for each group of microbial heterotrophs was significantly greater in the bathypelagic layer (500–2000 m) than the mesopelagic layer (110–500 m). A significant difference between groups was found only in the 500–2000 m layer: bacteria \&lt;HNF and ciliates for abundance and bacteria \&lt;HNF \&lt;ciliates for biomass. The ecological possible implication of microbial heterotrophs in these two layers is discussed.},

  abstract = {Roseobacter clade bacteria are ubiquitous in marine environments and now thought to be significant contributors to carbon and sulfur cycling. However, only a few strains of roseobacters have been isolated from the deep-sea water column and have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we present the complete genomes of phylogentically closed related Thiobacimonas profunda JLT2016 and Pelagibaca abyssi JLT2014 isolated from deep-sea water of the Southeastern Pacific. The genome sequences showed that the two deep-sea roseobacters carry genes for versatile metabolisms with functional capabilities such as ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-mediated carbon fixation and inorganic sulfur oxidation. Physiological and biochemical analysis showed that T. profunda JLT2016 was capable of autotrophy, heterotrophy, and mixotrophy accompanied by the production of exopolysaccharide. Heterotrophic carbon fixation via anaplerotic reactions contributed minimally to bacterial biomass. Comparative proteomics experiments showed a significantly up-regulated carbon fixation and inorganic sulfur oxidation associated proteins under chemolithotrophic conditions compared to heterotrophic conditions. Collectively, rosebacters show a high metabolic flexibility, suggesting a considerable capacity for adaptation to the marine environment.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to attain an integrated understanding of the dynamics of attached microbial communities in nature as governed by the component processes of particle formation, colonization, detachment, growth and interspecific interactions among the microbes. The study was conducted in mesocosms in a Danish fjord over a 2 wk period in April to May 2005. Despite nutrient additions, chlorophyll and particle concentrations were low and no distinct phytoplankton blooms were observed. Particle volume concentration was dominated by particles {$>$} 100 Pm. The abundance of attached bacteria was weakly but positively correlated with total particle volume. Phylogenetic composition of attached bacteria became increasingly different from that of free bacteria through time. Growth rates of free and attached bacteria were 0.31 and 0.023 d(-1), respectively. Colonization experiments with model agar aggregates showed that the bacterial community had limited apparent diffusivity but strong chemotaxis, which resulted in an up to 8-fold increase in bacterial colonization rates with organic-enriched aggregates. Estimated residence time of attached bacteria on aggregates was 21 min or less. Grazing mortality derived from temporal changes in attached bacterial abundance in the presence or absence of grazing activities ranged from 0 to 9.8 d(-1). In comparison, grazing mortality of free bacteria was 0.06 to 0.91 d(-1), suggesting that the bacterivorous flagellates were more adapted to grazing on surfaces than in free suspension. Very few attached flagellates were observed in the experiments, and microscopic observations revealed that many flagellates were attached only temporarily to surfaces. Our study showed that grazing mortality is a critical but often underappreciated factor in regulating marine snow bacterial population abundance. The loose association of bacterivorous flagellates with aggregates requires that their role be evaluated by direct grazing measurements instead of simple quantification of attached flagellate abundance.},

During September 2000, the earliest tidal-water records of cyanotoxins in the Bay identified microcystin from a Microcystis-dominated bloom on the Sassafras River. Between 2000 and 2006, opportunistic samples collected from cyanobacteria blooms were analyzed for toxin concentration to better inform natural resource, agriculture, and human-health management agencies on potential bloom-related health risks. The hepatotoxin microcystin was detected most frequently and over a range of concentrations from 2.9 × 10−2 to 6.58 × 102 μg L−1. Microcystin levels exceeded literature-based chronic drinking-water guidance values of 1 μg L−1 and recreational safety guidance for children of 10 μg L−1 in 71\% and 31\% of samples, respectively. Samples from tidal fresh and oligohaline habitats showed a log-normal distribution of toxin concentrations, and microcystin had positive log-linear relationship with Microcystis aeruginosa cell counts (r2 = 0.42). A subset of the samples positive for microcystin was also tested for neurotoxins and showed anatoxin-a as the next-most common toxin encountered (46\% of samples tested) at concentrations from 3 × 10−3 to 3 μg L−1. Saxitoxin (PSP-toxin) was present in trace amounts (3 × 10−3 μg L−1) in one sample. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii has occasionally been found in abundance, but all tests for cylindrospermopsin were negative. Microcystin and anatoxin-a have been identified in association with fish kills, bird kills, and human-health events. Virginia and Maryland state management agencies conducted beach closures during 2000, 2003, and 2004 and provided waterway health advisories in 2005 and 2006 in response to the findings.},

Hydrolysis rates of these compounds were compared with each other, and with uptake rates of potential hydrolysis products and other smaller derivatives (e.g., glutamic acid and dialanine). Results suggest that rates of peptide hydrolysis and uptake of hydrolysis products were not always correlated with each other along the salinity gradient, or to other environmental parameters measured in the James River and lower Chesapeake Bay. This may be because diverse input and removal processes can influence both peptide hydrolysis and uptake, but not necessarily simultaneously. Rates of both peptide hydrolysis and free amino acid uptake were strongly associated with particles, particularly those freshly produced. This suggests more rapid turnover of enzymatically available organic nitrogen in regions with elevated phytoplankton biomass. Changes in the abundance and composition of dissolved amino acids in these waters were also examined. Dissolved amino acid compositions, but not concentrations, varied with salinity along a gradient from the tidal fresh James River to the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. These compositional variations demonstrate the mixing of terrestrial organic nitrogen and in-situ production along the salinity transect.},

  abstract = {Plankton communities play a key role in the marine food web and are expected to be highly sensitive to ongoing environmental change. Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) causes pronounced shifts in marine carbonate chemistry and a decrease in seawater pH. These changes–summarized by the term ocean acidification (OA)–can significantly affect the physiology of planktonic organisms. However, studies on the response of entire plankton communities to OA, which also include indirect effects via food-web interactions, are still relatively rare. Thus, it is presently unclear how OA could affect the functioning of entire ecosystems and biogeochemical element cycles. In this study, we report from a long-term in situ mesocosm experiment, where we investigated the response of natural plankton communities in temperate waters (Gullmarfjord, Sweden) to elevated CO2 concentrations and OA as expected for the end of the century (\textasciitilde 760 μatm pCO2). Based on a plankton-imaging approach, we examined size structure, community composition and food web characteristics of the whole plankton assemblage, ranging from picoplankton to mesozooplankton, during an entire winter-to-summer succession. The plankton imaging system revealed pronounced temporal changes in the size structure of the copepod community over the course of the plankton bloom. The observed shift towards smaller individuals resulted in an overall decrease of copepod biomass by 25\%, despite increasing numerical abundances. Furthermore, we observed distinct effects of elevated CO2 on biomass and size structure of the entire plankton community. Notably, the biomass of copepods, dominated by Pseudocalanus acuspes, displayed a tendency towards elevated biomass by up to 30–40\% under simulated ocean acidification. This effect was significant for certain copepod size classes and was most likely driven by CO2-stimulated responses of primary producers and a complex interplay of trophic interactions that allowed this CO2 effect to propagate up the food web. Such OA-induced shifts in plankton community structure could have far-reaching consequences for food-web interactions, biomass transfer to higher trophic levels and biogeochemical cycling of marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Particle aggregation and the consequent formation of marine snow alter important properties of biogenic particles (size, sinking rate, degradability), thus playing a key role in controlling the vertical flux of organic matter to the deep ocean. However, there are still large uncertainties about rates and mechanisms of particle aggregation, as well as the role of plankton community structure in modifying biomass transfer from small particles to large fast-sinking aggregates. Here we present data from a high-resolution underwater camera system that we used to observe particle size distributions and formation of marine snow (aggregates {$>$}0.5 mm) over the course of a 9-week in situ mesocosm experiment in the Eastern Subtropical North Atlantic. After an oligotrophic phase of almost 4 weeks, addition of nutrient-rich deep water (650 m) initiated the development of a pronounced diatom bloom and the subsequent formation of large marine snow aggregates in all 8 mesocosms. We observed a substantial time lag between the peaks of chlorophyll a and marine snow biovolume of 9–12 days, which is much longer than previously reported and indicates a marked temporal decoupling of phytoplankton growth and marine snow formation during our study. Despite this time lag, our observations revealed substantial transfer of biomass from small particle sizes (single phytoplankton cells and chains) to marine snow aggregates of up to 2.5 mm diameter (ESD), with most of the biovolume being contained in the 0.5–1 mm size range. Notably, the abundance and community composition of mesozooplankton had a substantial influence on the temporal development of particle size spectra and formation of marine snow aggregates: While higher copepod abundances were related to reduced aggregate formation and biomass transfer towards larger particle sizes, the presence of appendicularia and doliolids enhanced formation of large marine snow. Furthermore, we combined in situ particle size distributions with measurements of particle sinking velocity to compute instantaneous (potential) vertical mass flux. However, somewhat surprisingly, we did not find a coherent relationship between our computed flux and measured vertical mass flux (collected by sediment traps in 15 m depth). Although the onset of measured vertical flux roughly coincided with the emergence of marine snow, we found substantial variability in mass flux among mesocosms that was not related to marine snow numbers, and was instead presumably driven by zooplankton-mediated alteration of sinking biomass and export of small particles (fecal pellets). Altogether, our findings highlight the role of zooplankton community composition and feeding interactions on particle size spectra and formation of marine snow aggregates, with important implications for our understanding of particle aggregation and vertical flux of organic matter in the ocean.},

But can a single B cell acquire all of these different fates? To find out, Taylor et al. tracked the responses of single B cells in mice. Although some B cells acquired only one fate, others differentiated into all three. The authors linked the ability of B cells to differentiate into multiple subsets to their ability to proliferate and resist cell death, and the affinity of their antigen receptor. Science, this issue p. 784 When exposed to antigens, naïve B cells differentiate into different types of effector cells: antibody-producing plasma cells, germinal center cells, or memory cells. Whether an individual naïve B cell can produce all of these different cell fates remains unclear. Using a limiting dilution approach, we found that many individual naïve B cells produced only one type of effector cell subset, whereas others produced all subsets. The capacity to differentiate into multiple subsets was a characteristic of clonal populations that divided many times and resisted apoptosis, but was independent of isotype switching. Antigen receptor affinity also influenced effector cell differentiation. These findings suggest that diverse effector cell types arise in the primary immune response as a result of heterogeneity in responses by individual naïve B cells. Antigen affinity and the ability to resist cell death determine the differentiation patterns of individual immunological B cells.

Anomalously high fluxes of particulate carbon were captured in sediment traps below this zone (455 m) in 16 of 71 observations. Here we present new evidence that bacterial chemoautotrophy, fueled by reduced sulfur species, supports an active secondary microbial food web in the RTZ and is potentially a large midwater source of labile, chemically unique, sedimenting biogenic debris to the basin's interior. Dissolved inorganic carbon assimilation (27-159 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) in this zone was equivalent to 10\%-333\% of contemporaneous primary production, depending on the season. However, vertical diffusion rates to the RTZ of electron donors and electron accepters were inadequate to support this production. Therefore, significant lateral intrusions of oxic waters, mixing processes, or intensive cycling of C, S, N, Mn, and Fe across the RTZ are necessary to balance electron equivalents. Chemoautotrophic production appears to be decoupled temporally from short-term surface processes, such as seasonal upwelling and blooms, and potentially is more responsive to longterm changes in surface productivity and deep-water ventilation on interannual to decadal timescales. Findings suggest that midwater production of organic carbon may contribute a unique signature to the basin's sediment record, thereby altering its paleoclimatological interpretation.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton blooms characterize temperate ocean margin zones in spring. We investigated the bacterioplankton response to a diatom bloom in the North Sea and observed a dynamic succession of populations at genus-level resolution. Taxonomically distinct expressions of carbohydrate-active enzymes (transporters; in particular, TonB-dependent transporters) and phosphate acquisition strategies were found, indicating that distinct populations of Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria are specialized for successive decomposition of algal-derived organic matter. Our results suggest that algal substrate availability provided a series of ecological niches in which specialized populations could bloom. This reveals how planktonic species, despite their seemingly homogeneous habitat, can evade extinction by direct competition.},

The relative abundance of Eury- and Crenarchaeota, assessed by catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH), was significantly higher in the western branch (17\% and 24\% of 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained cells, respectively) than in the eastern (9\% and 17\%, respectively) branch of the NADW. In contrast, the relative abundance of Bacteria (30\% of DAPI-stained cells) did not differ between the western and the eastern basin. Prokaryotic production and turnover rates, however, were higher in the western than the eastern basin. Generally, the contribution of Euryarchaeota to total picoplankton was correlated positively with oxygen concentrations (p {$<$} 0.001) and negatively with salinity (p {$<$} 0.001) and temperature (p {$<$} 0.001). The contribution of Crenarchaeota to total picoplankton correlated positively with oxygen (p {$<$} 0.05) and negatively with salinity (p {$<$} 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the crenarchaeotal contribution to picoplankton and nitrite concentration (p {$<$} 0.001), especially in the oxygen minimum layer, suggesting their potential involvement in the marine nitrogen cycle as nitrifiers. The observed variability in archaeal abundance in relation to bulk prokaryotic activity supports the emerging notion that Archaea are a highly dynamic and metabolically active component of the deep ocean prokaryotic Community.},

  abstract = {Small-world networks by Watts and Strogatz are a class of networks that are highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. These characteristics result in networks with unique properties of regional specialization with efficient information transfer. Social networks are intuitive examples of this organization with cliques or clusters of friends being interconnected, but each person is really only 5-6 people away from anyone else. While this qualitative definition has prevailed in network science theory, in application, the standard quantitative application is to compare path length (a surrogate measure of distributed processing) and clustering (a surrogate measure of regional specialization) to an equivalent random network. It is demonstrated here that comparing network clustering to that of a random network can result in aberrant findings and networks once thought to exhibit small-world properties may not. We propose a new small-world metric, \{\textbackslash omega\} (omega), which compares network clustering to an equivalent lattice network and path length to a random network, as Watts and Strogatz originally described. Example networks are presented that would be interpreted as small-world when clustering is compared to a random network but are not small-world according to \{\textbackslash omega\}. These findings have significant implications in network science as small-world networks have unique topological properties, and it is critical to accurately distinguish them from networks without simultaneous high clustering and low path length.},

This observation has been explained as a consequence of ubiquitous dispersal caused by the enormous population sizes of microbial species. Recently, this “everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects” theory has been challenged by the detection of considerable regional genetic variability within microbial morphospecies. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is expected under ubiquitous dispersal, evidence of regional-scale metacommunity processes can be detected in microbial morphospecies. Our results imply that the microbial and macrobial world are structured by analogous processes.},

  abstract = {A new multivariate analysis technique, developed to relate community composition to known variation in the environment, is described. The technique is an extension of correspondence analysis (reciprocal averaging), a popular ordination technique that extracts continuous axes of variation from species occurrence or abundance data. Such ordination axes are typically interpreted with the help of external knowledge and data on environmental variables; this two—step approach (ordination followed by environmental gradient identification) is termed indirect gradient analysis. In the new technique, called canonical correspondence analysis, ordination axes are chosen in the light of known environmental variables by imposing the extra restriction that the axes be linear combinations of environmental variables. In this way community variation can be directly related to environmental variation. The environmental variables may be quantitative or nominal. As many axes can be extracted as there are environmental variables. The method of detrending can be incorporated in the technique to remove arch effects. (Detrended) canonical correspondence analysis is an efficient ordination technique when species have bell—shaped response curves or surfaces with respect to environmental gradients, and is therefore more appropriate for analyzing data on community composition and environmental variables than canonical correlation analysis. The new technique leads to an ordination diagram in which points represent species and sites, and vectors represent environmental variables. Such a diagram shows the patterns of variation in community composition that can be explained best by the environmental variables and also visualizes approximately the "centers" of the species distributions along each of the environmental variables. Such diagrams effectively summarized relationships between community and environment for data sets on hunting spiders, dyke vegetation, and algae along a pollution gradient.

  abstract = {Heterotrophic microbial communities in seawater and sediments metabolize much of the organic carbon produced in the ocean. Although carbon cycling and preservation depend critically on the capabilities of these microbial communities, their compositions and capabilities have seldom been examined simultaneously at the same site. To compare the abilities of seawater and sedimentary microbial communities to initiate organic matter degradation, we measured the extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis rates of 10 substrates (polysaccharides and algal extracts) in surface seawater and bottom water as well as in surface and anoxic sediments of an Arctic fjord. Patterns of enzyme activities differed between seawater and sediments, not just quantitatively, in accordance with higher cell numbers in sediments, but also in their more diversified enzyme spectrum. Sedimentary microbial communities hydrolyzed all of the fluorescently labeled polysaccharide and algal extracts, in most cases at higher rates in subsurface than surface sediments. In seawater, in contrast, only 5 of the 7 polysaccharides and 2 of the 3 algal extracts were hydrolyzed, and hydrolysis rates in surface and deepwater were virtually identical. To compare bacterial communities, 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed from the same seawater and sediment samples; they diverged strongly in composition. Thus, the broader enzymatic capabilities of the sedimentary microbial communities may result from the compositional differences between seawater and sedimentary microbial communities, rather than from gene expression differences among compositionally similar communities. The greater number of phylum- and subphylum-level lineages and operational taxonomic units in sediments than in seawater samples may reflect the necessity of a wider range of enzymatic capabilities and strategies to access organic matter that has already been degraded during passage through the water column. When transformations of marine organic matter are considered, differences in community composition and their different abilities to access organic matter should be taken into account.},

  abstract = {The response of estuarine ecosystems to long-term changes in external forcing is strongly mediated by interactions between the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, oxygen, and inorganic nutrients. Although long-term changes in estuaries are often assessed at the annual scale, phytoplankton biomass, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and biogeochemical rate processes have strong seasonal cycles at temperate latitudes. Thus, changes in the seasonal timing, or phenology, of these key processes can reveal important features of long-term change and help clarify the nature of coupling between carbon, oxygen, and nutrient cycles. Changes in the phenology of estuarine processes may be difficult to assess, however, because many organisms are mobile and migratory, key primary and secondary producers have relatively rapid physiological turnover rates, sampling in time and space is often limited, and physical processes may dominate variability. To overcome these challenges, we have analyzed a 32-year record (1985-2016) of relatively frequent and consistent measurements of chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and physical drivers to understand long-term change in Chesapeake Bay. Using a suite of metrics that directly test for altered phenology, we quantified changes in the seasonal timing of key biogeochemical events, which allowed us to illustrate spatially- and seasonally-dependent shifts in the magnitude of linked biogeochemical parameters. Specifically, we found that a modest reduction in nitrate input was linked to a suppression of spring phytoplankton biomass in seaward Bay regions. This was, in turn, associated with an earlier breakup in hypoxia and decline in late-summer NH4+ accumulation in seaward waters. In contrast, we observed an increase in winter phytoplankton biomass in landward regions, which was associated with elevated early summer hypoxic volumes and NH4+ accumulation. Seasonal shifts in oxygen depletion and NH4+ accumulation are consistent with reduced nitrogen inputs, spatial patterns of chlorophyll-a, and increases in temperature. In addition, these increases have likely elevated rates of organic matter degradation, thus “speeding-up” the typical seasonal cycle. The causes for the recent landward shift in phytoplankton biomass and NH4+ accumulation are less clear; however, these altered patterns are analyzed here and discussed in terms of numerous physical, climatic, and biological changes in the estuary.},

  abstract = {A three-decade time series of solute concentrations was combined with a box-modeling system to analyze long-term trends in the concentration, production, and transport of dissolved inorganic nitrogen species along the mainstem axis of Chesapeake Bay. Water- and salt-balance calculations associated with boxmodeling provided regional, seasonal, and interannual estimates of net advective and nonadvective transport and net biogeochemical production rates for oxygen and dissolved nitrogen. The strongest decadal trends were observed for decreasing late-summer ammonium concentrations in bottom layers from brackish to polyhaline bay regions. Contemporaneous trends of increasing late-summer bottom-layer dissolved oxygen (O2) concentration were consistent with the observed NH41 patterns, suggesting that increasing dissolved O2 levels may also reflect declining bottom respiration and drive nitrogen loss via increased rates of coupled nitrification–denitrification. Significant (but weaker) trends of increasing nitrate plus nitrite (NO2132) concentration and net production were consistent with the notion that increased nitrification may be stimulated by increasing dissolved O2 concentrations. Sorting bottom water NH41 and NO2132 net production rates into two pools (before and after the year 2000) revealed that general seasonal patterns were similar, but recent NH41 net production rates were consistently lower and NO2132 and NO22 rates higher in summer and fall compared to earlier years, especially in the middle Bay regions. We conclude that late-season replenishment of oxygen associated with declining nutrient loads induced a negative feedback process, whereby decreased hypoxia suppressed NH41 recycling and created conditions favorable for additional nitrogen loss via coupled nitrification–denitrification.},

  abstract = {Sediment-water exchanges of nutrients and oxygen play an important role in the biogeochemistry of shallow coastal environments. Sediments process, store, and release particulate and dissolved forms of carbon and nutrients and sediment-water solute fluxes are significant components of nutrient, carbon, and oxygen cycles. Consequently, sediment biogeochemical models of varying complexity have been developed to understand the processes regulating porewater profiles and sediment-water exchanges. We have calibrated and validated a two-layer sediment biogeochemical model (aerobic and anaerobic) that is suitable for application as a stand-alone tool or coupled to water-column biogeochemical models. We calibrated and tested a stand-alone version of the model against observations of sediment-water flux, porewater concentrations, and process rates at 12 stations in Chesapeake Bay during a 4–17 year period. The model successfully reproduced sediment-water fluxes of ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3−), phosphate (PO43−), and dissolved silica (Si(OH)4 or DSi) for diverse chemical and physical environments. A root mean square error (RMSE)-minimizing optimization routine was used to identify best-fit values for many kinetic parameters. The resulting simulations improved the performance of the model in Chesapeake Bay and revealed (1) the need for an aerobic-layer denitrification formulation to account for NO3- reduction in this zone, (2) regional variability in denitrification that depends on oxygen levels in the overlying water, (3) a regionally-dependent solid-solute PO43− partitioning that accounts for patterns in Fe availability, and (4) a simplified model formulation for DSi, including limited sorption of DSi onto iron oxyhydroxides. This new calibration balances the need for a universal set of parameters that remain true to biogeochemical processes with site-specificity that represents differences in physical conditions. This stand-alone model can be rapidly executed on a personal computer and is well-suited to complement observational studies in a wide range of environments.},

  abstract = {Due to sampling difficulties, little is known about microbial communities associated with sinking marine snow in the twilight zone. A drifting sediment trap was equipped with a viscous cryogel and deployed to collect intact marine snow from depths of 100 and 400 m off Cape Blanc (Mauritania). Marine snow aggregates were fixed and washed in situ to prevent changes in microbial community composition and to enable subsequent analysis using catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH). The attached microbial communities collected at 100 m were similar to the free-living community at the depth of the fluorescence maximum (20 m) but different from those at other depths (150, 400, 550, and 700 m). Therefore, the attached microbial community seemed to be “inherited” from that at the fluorescence maximum. The attached microbial community structure at 400 m differed from that of the attached community at 100 m and from that of any free-living community at the tested depths, except that collected near the sediment at 700 m. The differences between the particle-associated communities at 400 m and 100 m appeared to be due to internal changes in the attached microbial community rather than de novo colonization, detachment, or grazing during the sinking of marine snow. The new sampling method presented here will facilitate future investigations into the mechanisms that shape the bacterial community within sinking marine snow, leading to better understanding of the mechanisms which regulate biogeochemical cycling of settling organic matter.},

  abstract = {Iron fertilization experiments in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll areas are known to induce phytoplankton blooms. However, little is known about the response of the microbial community upon iron fertilization. As part of the LOHAFEX experiment in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Bacteria and Archaea were monitored within and outside an induced bloom, dominated by Phaeocystis- like nanoplankton, during the 38 days of the experiment. The microbial production increased 1.6-fold (thymidine uptake) and 2.1-fold (leucine uptake), while total cell numbers increased only slightly over the course of the experiment. 454 tag pyrosequencing of partial 16S rRNA genes and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD FISH) showed that the composition and abundance of the bacterial and archaeal community in the iron-fertilized water body were remarkably constant without development of typical bloom-related succession patterns. Members of groups usually found in phytoplankton blooms, such as Roseobacter and Gammaproteobacteria, showed no response or only a minor response to the bloom. However, sequence numbers and total cell numbers of the SAR11 and SAR86 clades increased slightly but significantly toward the end of the experiment. It seems that although microbial productivity was enhanced within the fertilized area, a succession-like response of the microbial community upon the algal bloom was averted by highly effective grazing. Only small-celled members like the SAR11 and SAR86 clades could possibly escape the grazing pressure, explaining a net increase of those clades in numbers.},

To reliably detect the members, or operational taxonomic units (OTUs), that make up bacterial communities, taxonomic surveys rely on the use of the most informative PCR primers to amplify the broad range of phylotypes present in up-to-date reference databases. However, primers specific for the domain Bacteria were often developed some time ago against database versions that are now out of date. Here we evaluated the performance of four bacterial primers on complex microbial communities of an explosives contaminated and non-contaminated forest soil and by in silico evaluation against the current SILVA123 database. Primer pair 341f/785r produced the highest number of bacterial OTUs, phylogenetic richness, Shannon diversity, low non-specificity and most reproducible results, followed by 967f/1391r and 799f/1193r. Primer pair 68f/518r showed overall low coverage and a bias towards Alphaproteobacteria. The primer pair 341f/785r showed also in silico the highest coverage of the domain Bacteria (96.1 \%) with no obvious bias towards the majority of bacterial species. This suggests the high utility of primer pair 341f/785r for soil and plant-associated bacterial microbiome studies.},

The ability of the model to reproduce published observations, such as an approximate 1:10 ratio between bacterial and viral abundance, and the ability of viral lysis to account for 10-50\% of bacterial loss are discussed.},

  abstract = {Elsewhere in this volume, observations of the natural microbial food web in the Cyprus Gyre, eastern Mediterranean, and its transient responses both to phosphate additions in situ and to phosphate and ammonium additions when enclosed in microcosm bottles, are reported. We here explore an idealized four-population model of the microbial part of the food web, containing features suggested in these reports to be essential for the observed responses. Such features include a steady state with P-limited growth heterotrophic bacteria and P-limited or N/P co-limited growth of phytoplankton a mechanism for luxury consumption and nutrient storage in the osmotrophs (phytoplankton and bacteria), a supply of labile organic carbon substrates in excess of bacterial carbon demand, a relatively small excess of bio-available nitrogen, and an assumption that heterotrophic bacteria are superior to phytoplankton in competing for dissolved organic nitrogen. From a P-limited steady-state dominated by heterotrophic organisms, the model responds to the in situ phosphate addition of the Lagrangian experiment with a decrease in chlorophyll, an increase in bacterial production and in bacterial biomass, and a decrease in uptake potential for phosphate. These modeled responses at the osmotroph level are qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to those observed, while detailed comparison of model and observations at the predator level appears more difficult. The model is also able to explain main traits of the dynamic patterns observed in microcosm experiments, both when different concentrations of phosphate were added to previously unperturbed water, and when water collected inside the patch of the Lagrangian experiment was enclosed and supplied with ammonia. We conclude that the idealized model contains sufficient elements to capture a useful first-order approximation to a presumably quite complex microbial food web. In this model, predator growth responds not only to food quantity, but also to food quality (stoichiometry). From steady states where also zooplankt.on are P-limited, the model thus has a potential for much more rapid zooplankton response to a phosphate-pulse than possible in models with fixed organism stoichiometry. The potential of transmitting a signal to the copepod level via food composition, rather than only via food abundance, is discussed. Implicit in both model and observations is a requirement of a large, unmeasured, production of degradable organic substrates for bacterial growth. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The recent discovery of viruses infecting this clade led to the suggestion that such dominance could not be explained by assuming SAR11 to be a defense specialist and that the explanation therefore should be sought in its competitive abilities. The issue is complicated by the fact that prokaryotes may develop strains differing in their balance between competition and viral defense, a situation not really captured by present idealized models that operate only with virus-controlled “host groups.” We here develop a theoretical framework where abundance within species emerges as the sum over virus-controlled strains and show that high abundance then is likely to occur for species able to use defense mechanisms with a low trade-off between competition and defense, rather than by extreme investment in one strategy or the other. The J-shaped activity–abundance community distribution derived from this analysis explains the high proportion low-active prokaryotes as a consequence of extreme defense as an alternative to explanations based on dormancy or death due to nutrient starvation.},

Here we discuss consequences of the simplifying assumption that there are only 5 potentially important interactions between heterotrophic bacteria and their biological and chemical environment. We consider 3 possible types of growth rate limitation: (1) organic carbon, (2) inorganic phosphate, and (3) organic and inorganic nitrogen; and 2 types of cell losses: (1) predation by heterotrophic flagellates, or (2) lysis by infectious viruses. Incorporating this into simple food web structures, we discuss 4 classes of models, 2 based on carbon limitation and 2 based on mineral nutrient limitation of bacterial growth rate. Bacterial abundance is assumed to be controlled by protozoan predation in all cases. For each class, we derive expressions describing bacterial carbon demand, and discuss the control of bacterial carbon demand, growth rate and diversity. It is shown how models predicting an ecosystem production of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) exceeding bacterial carbon demand may be constructed assuming either a low degradability of the DOG, or mineral nutrient limitation of bacterial growth rate. For 2 classes of models, infectious viruses are shown to affect neither growth rate nor abundance of the steady state bacterial community. For all 4 classes of models, viruses are suggested to control diversity of the steady state bacterial community.},

Changes in ciliate biomass will then drive changes in bacterial production and carbon demand. This model was compared to experimental microcosms where natural mixed microbial communities from Villefranche Bay (northwest Mediterranean) were given daily additions of phosphate and glucose in a factorial design. In accordance with the proposed model, we found no effect of glucose additions on the incorporation of C-14-leucine, except when combined with phosphate. Phosphate enrichment had a stimulatory effect on bacterial production, even when no glucose was added, but after an initial phase of ca 2 d, leucine incorporation increased more in carboys receiving glucose and phosphate in combination than in carboys enriched with phosphate alone. After 3 to 4 d, leucine incorporation culminated. These observations are consistent with a scenario where, initially, bacterial growth rate was P-limited. Stimulation of bacterial carbon demand resulting from transfer of added phosphorus into ciliate biomass was, however, apparently larger than the increase in the system's production of labile organic C. The explanation suggested for the observed culmination in bacterial production is thus a switch from P- to C-limited bacterial growth rate. In such a scenario, glucose addition allows a larger increase in bacterial consumption before the pool of labile DOC is depleted. DOC accumulation was found only in carboys to which glucose was added without phosphate.},

  abstract = {Members of the diverse bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes have colonized virtually all types of habitats on Earth. They are among the major members of the microbiota of animals, especially in the gastrointestinal tract, can act as pathogens and are frequently found in soils, oceans and freshwater. In these contrasting ecological niches, Bacteroidetes are increasingly regarded as specialists for the degradation of high molecular weight organic matter, i.e., proteins and carbohydrates. This review presents the current knowledge on the role and mechanisms of polysaccharide degradation by Bacteroidetes in their respective habitats. The recent sequencing of Bacteroidetes genomes confirms the presence of numerous carbohydrate-active enzymes covering a large spectrum of substrates from plant, algal, and animal origin. Comparative genomics reveal specific Polysaccharide Utilization Loci shared between distantly related members of the phylum, either in environmental or gut-associated species. Moreover, Bacteroidetes genomes appear to be highly plastic and frequently reorganized through genetic rearrangements, gene duplications and lateral gene transfers (LGT), a feature that could have driven their adaptation to distinct ecological niches. Evidence is accumulating that the nature of the diet shapes the composition of the intestinal microbiota. We address the potential links between gut and environmental bacteria through food consumption. LGT can provide gut bacteria with original sets of utensils to degrade otherwise refractory substrates found in the diet. A more complete understanding of the genetic gateways between food-associated environmental species and intestinal microbial communities sheds new light on the origin and evolution of Bacteroidetes as animals’ symbionts. It also raises the question as to how the consumption of increasingly hygienic and processed food deprives our microbiota from useful environmental genes and possibly affects our health.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus contributes significantly to ocean primary productivity. The link between primary productivity and iron in specific ocean regions is well established and iron limitation of Prochlorococcus cell division rates in these regions has been shown. However, the extent of ecotypic variation in iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus and the molecular basis for differences is not understood. Here, we examine the growth and transcriptional response of Prochlorococcus strains, MED4 and MIT9313, to changing iron concentrations. During steady state, MIT9313 sustains growth at an order-of-magnitude lower iron concentration than MED4. To explore this difference, we measured the whole-genome transcriptional response of each strain to abrupt iron starvation and rescue. Only four of the 1159 orthologs of MED4 and MIT9313 were differentially expressed in response to iron in both strains. However, in each strain, the expression of over a hundred additional genes changed, many of which are in labile genomic regions, suggesting a role for lateral gene transfer in establishing diversity of iron metabolism among Prochlorococcus. Furthermore, we found that MED4 lacks three genes near the iron-deficiency-induced gene (idiA) that are present and induced by iron stress in MIT9313. These genes are interesting targets for studying the adaptation of natural Prochlorococcus assemblages to local iron conditions as they show more diversity than other genomic regions in environmental metagenomic databases.},

  abstract = {Upwelling systems play a key role in the global carbon and nitrogen cycles and are also of local relevance due to their high productivity and fish resources. To capture and understand the high spatial and temporal variability in physical and biogeochemical parameters found in these regions, novel measurement techniques have to be combined in an interdisciplinary manner. Here we use high-resolution glider-based physical–biogeochemical observations in combination with ship-based underwater vision profiler, sensor and bottle data to investigate the drivers of oxygen and nitrate variability across the shelf break off Mauritania in June 2014. Distinct oxygen and nitrate variability shows up in our glider data. High-oxygen and low-nitrate anomalies were clearly related to water mass variability and probably linked to ocean transport. Low-oxygen and high-nitrate patches co-occurred with enhanced turbidity signals close to the seabed, which suggests locally high microbial respiration rates of resuspended organic matter near the sea floor. This interpretation is supported by high particle abundance observed by the underwater vision profiler and enhanced particle-based respiration rate estimates close to the seabed. Discrete in situ measurements of dissolved organic carbon and amino acids suggest the formation of dissolved organic carbon due to particle dissolution near the seabed fueling additional microbial respiration. During June an increase in the oxygen concentration on the shelf break of about 15 µmol kg−1 was observed. These changes go along with meridional circulation changes but cannot be explained by typical water mass property changes. Thus our high-resolution interdisciplinary observations highlight the complex interplay of remote and local physical–biogeochemical drivers of oxygen and nitrate variability off Mauritania, which cannot be captured by classical shipboard observations alone.},

  abstract = {The partitioning of organic matter (OM) between dissolved and particulate phases is an important factor in determining the fate of organic carbon in the ocean. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) release by phytoplankton is a ubiquitous process, resulting in 2–50\% of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis leaving the cell. This loss can be divided into two components: passive leakage by diffusion across the cell membrane and the active exudation of DOM into the surrounding environment. At present there is no method to distinguish whether DOM is released via leakage or exudation. Most explanations for exudation remain hypothetical; as while DOM release has been measured extensively, there has been relatively little work to determine why DOM is released. Further research is needed to determine the composition of the DOM released by phytoplankton and to link composition to phytoplankton physiological status and environmental conditions. For example, the causes and physiology of phytoplankton cell death are poorly understood, though cell death increases membrane permeability and presumably DOM release. Recent work has shown that phytoplankton interactions with bacteria are important in determining both the amount and composition of the DOM released. In response to increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, climate change is creating increasingly stressful conditions for phytoplankton in the surface ocean, including relatively warm water, low pH, low nutrient supply and high light. As ocean physics and chemistry change, it is hypothesized that a greater proportion of primary production will be released directly by phytoplankton into the water as DOM. Changes in the partitioning of primary production between the dissolved and particulate phases will have bottom-up effects on ecosystem structure and function. There is a need for research to determine how these changes affect the fate of organic matter in the ocean, particularly the efficiency of the biological carbon pump.},

  abstract = {Highly sensitive STOX O2 sensors were used for determination of in situ O2 distribution in the eastern tropical north and south Pacific oxygen minimum zones (ETN/SP OMZs), as well as for laboratory determination of O2 uptake rates of water masses at various depths within these OMZs. Oxygen was generally below the detection limit (few nmolL−1) in the core of both OMZs, suggesting the presence of vast volumes of functionally anoxic waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Oxygen was often not detectable in the deep secondary chlorophyll maximum found at some locations, but other secondary maxima contained up to \textasciitilde 0.4µmolL−1. Directly measured respiration rates were high in surface and subsurface oxic layers of the coastal waters, reaching values up to 85nmolL−1 O2h−1. Substantially lower values were found at the depths of the upper oxycline, where values varied from 2 to 33nmolL−1 O2h−1. Where secondary chlorophyll maxima were found the rates were higher than in the oxic water just above. Incubation times longer than 20h, in the all-glass containers, resulted in highly increased respiration rates. Addition of amino acids to the water from the upper oxycline did not lead to a significant initial rise in respiration rate within the first 20h, indicating that the measurement of respiration rates in oligotrophic Ocean water may not be severely affected by low levels of organic contamination during sampling. Our measurements indicate that aerobic metabolism proceeds efficiently at extremely low oxygen concentrations with apparent half-saturation concentrations (Km values) ranging from about 10 to about 200nmolL−1.},

We measured turnover rates of dead Periphylla periphylla in a pelagic in situ experiment in Raunefjorden, Norway. Decay was exponential, with decay-coefficients of 0.67 to 1.12 d–1; smaller jellyfish turned over faster than larger ones. The rapid turnover suggests that large amounts of carbon and nitrogen are transferred to the pelagic and/or benthic foodwebs at the collapse of jellyfish blooms. The interactions between bacteria and dead jellyfish were examined in a shipboard experiment in Lurefjorden, Norway, using natural bacterial assemblages. Growth and morphology of the bacteria in the incubations suggested that only certain morphotypes proliferated in the vicinity of jellyfish tissue. Subsequent experiments with homogenized P. periphylla tissue and bacterial isolates from various phylogenetic groups confirmed that some bacteria could use jellyfish as substrate, while others were inhibited. Tests with sensitive isolates revealed that inhibition of bacterial growth depended on the body part, size and concentration of P. periphylla used. Because only some bacteria were able to use P. periphylla as a substrate, we suggest that the role of dead jellyfish as trophic links in specific pelagic foodwebs depends partly on bacterial community composition.},

Anthropogenic impacts and the need for systematic conservation planning have further motivated the analysis of diversity patterns and processes at regional to global scales(3). Whereas land diversity patterns and their predictors are known for numerous taxa(4,5), our understanding of global marine diversity has been more limited, with recent findings revealing some striking contrasts to widely held terrestrial paradigms(6-8). Here we examine global patterns and predictors of species richness across 13 major species groups ranging from zooplankton to marine mammals. Two major patterns emerged: coastal species showed maximum diversity in the Western Pacific, whereas oceanic groups consistently peaked across broad mid-latitudinal bands in all oceans. Spatial regression analyses revealed sea surface temperature as the only environmental predictor highly related to diversity across all 13 taxa. Habitat availability and historical factors were also important for coastal species, whereas other predictors had less significance. Areas of high species richness were disproportionately concentrated in regions with medium or higher human impacts. Our findings indicate a fundamental role of temperature or kinetic energy in structuring cross-taxon marine biodiversity, and indicate that changes in ocean temperature, in conjunction with other human impacts, may ultimately rearrange the global distribution of life in the ocean.},

Conclusion: There is a close relation among the serotypes of enterovirus shed in stools and isolated from the environment but few serotypes which were detected in sewage samples were not found clinically and the few which were detected clinically not found in sewage because some viruses are difficult to detect by the cell culture method.This study will be helpful for the researchers who are working on polio and nonpolio enterovirus especially in the countries which are struggling for polio eradication.},

  abstract = {Background Microbial communities (microbiota) influence human and animal disease and immunity, geochemical nutrient cycling and plant productivity. Specific groups, including bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes or fungi, are amplified by PCR to assess the relative abundance of sub-groups (e.g. genera). However, neither the absolute abundance of sub-groups is revealed, nor can different amplicon families (i.e. OTUs derived from a specific pair of PCR primers such as bacterial 16S, eukaryotic 18S or fungi ITS) be compared. This prevents determination of the absolute abundance of a particular group and domain-level shifts in microbiota abundance can remain undetected. Results We have developed absolute quantitation of amplicon families using synthetic chimeric DNA spikes. Synthetic spikes were added directly to environmental samples, co-isolated and PCR-amplified, allowing calculation of the absolute abundance of amplicon families (e.g. prokaryotic 16S, eukaryotic 18S and fungal ITS per unit mass of sample). Conclusions Spikes can be adapted to any amplicon-specific group including rhizobia from soils, Firmicutes and Bifidobacteria from human gut or Enterobacteriaceae from food samples. Crucially, using highly complex soil samples, we show that the absolute abundance of specific groups can remain steady or increase, even when their relative abundance decreases. Thus, without absolute quantitation, the underlying pathology, physiology and ecology of microbial groups may be masked by their relative abundance.

However, while the conventional phenol-chloroform RNA extraction is preferable over silica-based columns, particularly when cost is a concern or higher RNA yield is desired, it can result in significant RNA contamination. Contaminants including excess phenol, chloroform, or salts, can have significant impacts on downstream applications, including RNA quantification and reverse transcription, that can skew data collection and interpretation. To overcome the issue of RNA contamination in the conventional phenol-chloroform based RNA extraction method, we have optimized the protocol by adding one chloroform extraction step, and several RNA washing steps. Importantly, RNA quality and purity and accuracy in the quantification of RNA concentration were significantly improved with the modified protocol, resulting in reliable data collection and interpretation in downstream gene expression analysis. •Our protocol is customized by the addition of a second chloroform extraction step. Chloroform is carefully pipetted so as to not disturb the interphase layer. Any contaminants accidentally removed from interphase will be present in subsequent steps and can result in RNA contaminated with protein or phenol. The additional chloroform step increases RNA purity.•Additionally, the addition of 2 additional ethanol washes, initially intended to remove any residual salts from the isopropanol RNA precipitation step, also removed residual phenol contamination, enhancing RNA purity.•In summary, these modifications serve to enhance not only the purity of the RNA but, also increase the accuracy and reliability of RNA quantification.},

Cosmopolitan freshwater cyanobacteria of the Microcystis genus can produce the toxin microcystin, and present a potential health risk in many eutrophic lakes. In this study, M. aeruginosa Strain PCC 7806 was grown in semi-continuous turbidostats to investigate the effect of increasing salinity on growth rate, microcystin cell quota, microcystin production and extracellular microcystin concentration. Specific growth rate, microcystin cell quota and microcystin production remained more or less unaffected by salinity levels up to 10 g l–1. Specific growth rate collapsed when salinity was increased beyond 10 g l–1 for several weeks. Cell size and microcystin cell quota decreased while extracellular microcystin concentrations increased at salinities above 10 g l–1, indicating leakage and/or cell lysis. Salt-shock experiments revealed that M. aeruginosa can temporarily endure salinities as high as 17.5 g l–1. These results indicate that, for a freshwater species, M. aeruginosa has a high salt tolerance. Rising salinities in freshwater ecosystems are therefore unlikely to suppress M. aeruginosa blooms, and may in fact enhance the exposure of aquatic organisms to elevated concentrations of extracellular microcystins.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons (16S-seq) has become a widely deployed method for profiling complex microbial communities but technical pitfalls related to data reliability and quantification remain to be fully addressed. In this work, we have developed and implemented a set of synthetic 16S rRNA genes to serve as universal spike-in standards for 16S-seq experiments. The spike-ins represent full-length 16S rRNA genes containing artificial variable regions with negligible identity to known nucleotide sequences, permitting unambiguous identification of spike-in sequences in 16S-seq read data from any microbiome sample. Using defined mock communities and environmental microbiota, we characterized the performance of the spike-in standards and demonstrated their utility for evaluating data quality on a per-sample basis. Further, we showed that staggered spike-in mixtures added at the point of DNA extraction enable concurrent estimation of absolute microbial abundances suitable for comparative analysis. Results also underscored that template-specific Illumina sequencing artifacts may lead to biases in the perceived abundance of certain taxa. Taken together, the spike-in standards represent a novel bioanalytical tool that can substantially improve 16S-seq-based microbiome studies by enabling comprehensive quality control along with absolute quantification.},

  abstract = {Microbiota presumably plays an essential role in inhibiting pathogen colonization and in the maintenance of health in oysters, but limited data exist concerning their different growth phases and conditions. We analyzed the bacterial microbiota composition of two commercial oysters: Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea corteziensis. Differences in microbiota were assayed in three growth phases: post-larvae at the hatchery, juvenile, and adult at two grow-out cultivation sites. Variations in the microbiota were assessed by PCR analysis of the 16S rRNA gene in DNA extracted from depurated oysters. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles were studied using Dice’s similarity coefficient (Cs) and statistical principal component analysis (PCA). The microbiota composition was determined by sequencing temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) bands. The RFLP analysis of post-larvae revealed homology in the microbiota of both oyster species (Cs {$>$} 88 \%). Dice and PCA analyses of C. corteziensis but not C. gigas showed differences in the microbiota according to the cultivation sites. The sequencing analysis revealed low bacterial diversity (primarily β-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Spirochaetes), with Burkholderia cepacia being the most abundant bacteria in both oyster species. This study provides the first description of the microbiota in C. corteziensis, which was shown to be influenced by cultivation site conditions. During early growth, we observed that B. cepacia colonized and remained strongly associated with the two oysters, probably in a symbiotic host–bacteria relationship. This association was maintained in the three growth phases and was not altered by environmental conditions or the management of the oysters at the grow-out site.},

We studied vertical and temporal patterns in the microbial community composition in a set of 412 samples collected from the upper 300m of the water column in the northwestern Sargasso Sea, on cruises between 1991 and 2004. The region sampled spans the extent of deep winter mixing and the transition between the euphotic and the upper mesopelagic zones, where most carbon fixation and reoxidation occurs. A bioinformatic pipeline was developed to de-noise, normalize and align terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) data from three restriction enzymes and link T-RFLP peaks to microbial clades. Non-metric multidimensional scaling statistics resolved three microbial communities with distinctive composition during seasonal stratification: a surface community in the region of lowest nutrients, a deep chlorophyll maximum community and an upper mesopelagic community. A fourth microbial community was associated with annual spring blooms of eukaryotic phytoplankton that occur in the northwestern Sargasso Sea as a consequence of winter convective mixing that entrains nutrients to the surface. Many bacterial clades bloomed in seasonal patterns that shifted with the progression of stratification. These richly detailed patterns of community change suggest that highly specialized adaptations and interactions govern the success of microbial populations in the oligotrophic ocean.

Following a Lagrangian strategy, we sampled plume, frontal and marine layers. The sampled estuarine gradient exhibited large changes both in physico-chemical and in microbiological characteristics. Bacterial abundances and activities showed a more drastic decrease in the low salinity range of the gradient than expected from simple dilution models, indicating that an important fraction of freshwater bacteria disappeared in the mixing area, High specific activities, in particular for leucine, in the marine end-part of the gradient suggested important bacterial protein synthesis, which may be a sign of an active survival strategy for bacterial communities subjected to oligotrophic conditions. Bacterial genetic diversity of the sampled estuarine area, as estimated by the number of DNA-derived denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands, was high (13 to 55 bands) compared to that reported in other aquatic ecosystems. This high diversity may be the consequence of the interface position of estuaries. The proportion of active populations was estimated using the ratio of DGGE bands derived from RNA and DNA. This ratio was lower in Rhone water than in marine water, indicating that only a part of the constitutive populations were active, while the activity was distributed within a larger fraction Of populations in the marine assemblage, Very few DGGE bands detected in freshwater samples were also detected in the marine end-part of the gradient, suggesting that a very limited number of freshwater bacteria could survive under marine conditions. Detection of these freshwater populations from RNA might indicate that these bacteria were able to synthesize different stress proteins as the result of a survival strategy or that these bacteria were able to maintain metabolic activity under marine conditions, The structure of marine communities was strongly affected by decreasing salinity. However, it seems that the decrease of DNA-derived bands may simply have been the consequence of the mixing of marine and freshwater. No obvious relationship between genetic richness and activity changes was observed. This lack of a relationship may be the consequence of a very short residence time of water in the mixing area studied.},

Surprisingly, few studies have considered the effect of macroorganism-microbe interactions on the ecology and distribution dynamics of rare microbial taxa. In this review, we synthesize several lines of evidence that these relationships cannot be neglected any longer. First, we provide empirical support that the microbiome of macroorganisms represents a significant part of marine bacterial biodiversity and that host-microbe interactions benefit to certain microbial populations which are part of the rare biosphere (i.e. opportunistic copiotrophic organisms). Second, we reveal the major role that macroorganisms may have on the dispersal and the geographic distribution of microbes. Third, we introduce an innovative and integrated view of the interactions between microbes and macroorganisms, namely sustaining the rares, which suggests that macroorganisms favor the maintenance of marine microbial diversity and are involved in the regulation of its richness and dynamics. Finally, we show how this hypothesis complements existing theories in microbial ecology and offers new perspectives about the importance of macroorganisms for the microbial biosphere, particularly the rare members.},

  abstract = {Among the parameters affecting carbon transfer to the ocean interior, particle sinking rates vary three orders of magnitude and thus more than primary production, f-ratios, or particle carbon contents [e.g., Boyd, P.W., Trull, T.W., 2006. Understanding the export of marine biogenic particles: is there consensus? Progress in Oceanography 4, 276–312, doi:10.1016/j.pocean.2006.10.007]. Very few data have been obtained from the mesopelagic zone where the majority of carbon remineralization occurs and the attenuation of the sinking flux is determined. Here, we report sinking rates from ∼300m depth for the subtropical (station ALOHA, June 2004) and subarctic (station K2, July 2005) North Pacific Ocean, obtained from short (6.5 day) deployments of an indented rotating sphere (IRS) sediment trap operating as an in situ settling column [Peterson, M.L., Wakeham, S.G., Lee, C., Askea, M.A., Miquel, J.C., 2005. Novel techniques for collection of sinking particles in the ocean and determining their settling rates. Limnology and Oceanography Methods 3, 520–532] to separate the flux into 11 sinking-rate fractions ranging from {$>$}820 to {$>$}2md−1 that are collected by a carousel for further analysis. Functioning of the IRS trap was tested using a novel programming sequence to check that all particles have cleared the settling column prior to the next delivery of particles by the 6-hourly rotation cycle of the IRS. There was some evidence (from the flux distribution among the cups and photomicroscopy of the collected particles) that very slow-sinking particles may have been under-collected because they were unable to penetrate the brine-filled collection cups, but good evidence for appropriate collection of fast-settling fractions. Approximately 50\% of the particulate organic carbon (POC) flux was sinking at greater than 100md−1 at both stations. At ALOHA, more than 15\% of the POC flux sank at {$>$}820md−1, but low fluxes make this uncertain, and precluded resolution of particles sinking slower than 137md−1. At K2, less than 1\% of the POC flux sank at {$>$}820md−1, but a large fraction (∼15–45\%) of the flux was contributed by other fast-sinking classes (410 and 205md−1). PIC and BSi minerals were not present in higher proportions in the faster sinking fractions, but the observations were too limited to rule out a ballasting contribution to the control of sinking rates. Photographic evidence for a wide range of particle types within individual sinking-rate fractions suggests that biological processes that set the porosity and shape of particles are also important and may mask the role of minerals. Comparing the spectrum of sinking rates observed at K2 with the power-law profile of flux attenuation with depth obtained from other VERTIGO sediment traps deployed at multiple depths [Buesseler, K.O., Lamborg, C.H., Boyd, P.W., Lam, P.J., Trull, T.W., Bidigare, R.R., Bishop, J.K.B., Casciotti, K.L., Dehairs, F., Elskens, M., Honda, M., Karl, D.M., Siegel, D., Silver, M., Steinberg, D., Valdes, J., Van Mooy, B., Wilson, S.E., 2007b. Revisiting carbon flux through the Ocean's twilight zone. Science 316(5824), 567–570, doi: 10.1126/science.1137959] emphasizes the importance of particle transformations within the mesopelagic zone in the control of carbon transport to the ocean interior.},

  abstract = {The term beta diversity has been used to refer to a wide variety of phenomena. Although all of these encompass some kind of compositional heterogeneity between places, many are not related to each other in any predictable way. The present two-part review aims to put the different phenomena that have been called a beta component of diversity into a common conceptual framework, and to explain what each of them measures. In this first part, the focus is on defining beta diversity. This involves deciding what diversity is and how the observed total or gamma diversity (γ) is partitioned into alpha (α) and beta (β) components. Several different definitions of “beta diversity” that result from these decisions have been used in the ecological literature. True beta diversity is obtained when the total effective number of species in a dataset (true gamma diversityγ) is multiplicatively partitioned into the effective number of species per compositionally distinct virtual sampling unit (true alpha diversityαd) and the effective number of such compositional units (βMd=γ/αd). All true diversities quantify the effective number of types of entities. Because the other variants of “beta diversity” that have been used by ecologists quantify other phenomena, an alternative nomenclature is proposed here for the seven most popular beta components: regional-to-local diversity ratio, two-way diversity ratio, absolute effective species turnover (=regional diversity excess), Whittaker's effective species turnover, proportional effective species turnover, regional entropy excess and regional variance excess. In the second part of the review, the focus will be on how to quantify these phenomena in practice. This involves deciding how the sampling units that contribute to total diversity are selected, and whether the entity that is quantified is all of “beta diversity”, a specific part of “beta diversity”, the rate of change in “beta diversity” in relation to a given external factor, or something else.},

  abstract = {The effect of pressure on upper ocean free-living bacteria and bacteria attached to rapidly sinking particles was investigated through studying their ability to synthesize DNA and protein by measuring their rate of 3H-thymidine and 3H-leucine incorporation. Studies were carried out on samples from the NE Atlantic under the range of pressures (1–430 atm) encountered by sinking aggregates during their journey to the deep-sea bed. Thymidine and leucine incorporation rates per bacterium attached to sinking particles from 200 m were about six and ten times higher, respectively, than the free-living bacterial assemblage. The ratio of leucine incorporation rate per cell to thymidine incorporation rate per cell was significantly different between the larger attached (18.9:1) and smaller free-living (10.4:1) assemblages. The rates of leucine and thymidine incorporation decreased exponentially with increasing pressure for the free-living and linearly for attached bacteria, while there was no significant influence of pressure on cell numbers. At 100 atm leucine and thymidine incorporation rate per free-living bacterium was reduced to 73 and 20\%, respectively, relative to that measured at 1 atm. Pressure of 100 atm reduced leucine and thymidine incorporation per attached bacterium to 94 and 70\%, and at 200 atm these rates were reduced to 34 and 51\%, respectively, relative to those measured at 1 atm. There was no significant uncoupling of thymidine and leucine incorporation for either the free-living or attached bacterial assemblages with increasing pressure, indicating that the processess of DNA and protein synthesis may be equally affected by increasing pressure. It is therefore unlikely that bacteria, originating from surface waters, attached to rapidly sinking particles play a role in particle remineralization below approximately 1000–2000 m. These results may help to explain the occurrence of relatively fresh aggregates on the deep-sea bed that still contain sufficient organic carbon to fuel the rapid growth of benthic micro-organisms; they also indicate that the effect of pressure on microbial processes may be important in oceanic biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {Suspended particles are instrumental in controlling the reactivity, transport and biological impacts of substances in aquatic environments, and provide a crucial link for chemical constituents between the water column, bed sediment and food chain. This article reviews the role of suspended particles in the chemical and biological cycling of trace constituents (trace metals, organo-metallic compounds and hydrophobic organic micropollutants; HOMs) in estuaries, with particular emphasis on the effects of and changes to particle reactivity and composition. The partitioning (or distribution coefficient,KD ) and bioavailability of chemical constituents, and assimilation efficiency (AE) of such by bivalve suspension feeders, are identified as key parameters requiring definition for accurate biogeochemical modelling, and the discussion centres around the determination of and controls on these parameters. Particle-water interactions encompass a variety of physical, biological, electrostatic and hydrophobic effects, and are largely dependent on the character and concentration of suspended particles and salinity. The salinity-dependence results from the competing and complexing effects of seawater ions for trace metals, and the compression of water in the presence of dissolved seawater ions and consequent salting out of neutral solute (HOMs, organo-metallic compounds and some trace metal complexes). The extent of biological solubilization of chemical constituents from suspended particles is dependent on the nature of chemical components of the gastro-intestinal environment and their interactions with ingested particles, and the physiological (e.g. gut passage time) and chemical (e.g. redox conditions and pH) constraints imposed on these interactions. Generally, chemicals that associate with fine, organic-rich particles (or, for some HOMs, fine inorganic particles), and desorb at pH 5–6 and/or complex with digestive enzymes or surfactants are most readily solubilized in the gut. The extent of assimilation of solubilized chemical is then determined by its ability to pass the gut lining and partition into cytosolic material. In practice, KD and AE are determined experimentally by means of radiotracers added to contained suspensions or mesocosms, while operational measurement of bioavailability relies on in vitro chemical or biological (enzymatic) extraction of particles. What is lacking, however, and is identified as an ultimate goal of future research, is the ability to predict these parameters from theoretical principles and thermodynamic constants. Since many of the inherent interactions and mechanisms are controlled by particle composition and reactivity, a more immediate objective would be better characterization of the biogeochemical properties of suspended particles themselves. This includes chemical resolution of the bulk organic matter, definition of the abundance and synergistic effects of component sorbent phases, and determination of the effects of particle-seawater ion interactions on the reactivity of the particle surface.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Zooplankton fecal pellets have long been thought to be a dominant component of the sedimentary flux in marine and freshwater ecosystems, but that view is changing. The last 2 decades have seen publication of {$>$}500 studies using sediment traps, which reveal that zooplankton fecal pellets often constitute only a minor or variable proportion of the sedimentary flux. Substantial proportions of this flux are from organic aggregates (Œmarine snow¹) of various origins, including phytoplankton blooms, which sediment directly to the benthos. It now appears that mainly large fecal pellets of macrozooplankton and fish are involved in the sedimentary flux. Smaller fecal pellets of microzooplankton and small mesozooplankton are mostly recycled or repackaged in the water column by microbial decomposition and coprophagy, contributing more to processes in the water column than flux to the benthos. The relative contributions of fecal pellets, marine snow and sinking phytoplankton to the vertical flux and recycling of materials in the water column are highly variable, dependent upon multiple interacting factors. These include variations in productivity, biomass, size spectra and composition of communities in the overlying water columns, and trophic interactions between various components of the plankton and nekton communities at various times, locations and depths. Other factors include differences in sinking rates, sizes, composition and pollutant contents of fecal pellets produced by various sizes of zooplankters, and zooplankton feeding-fecal pellet production interactions in relation to upwelling and El Niño periods, seasonal life-history-related zooplankton vertical migrations and long-term oceanographic regime shifts. There are also suggestions from the geological record that zooplankton fecal pellets may have been important in ancient oceans. The ecological roles of marine snow and phytoplankton aggregates in sedimentary flux also depend on a variety of interacting factors, including sources of origin, degrees of microbial colonization, depth distributions, sinking rates and ingestibility by consumers. Perhaps the major reversal of the previous paradigm on the role of fecal pellets in the sedimentary flux over the last 2 decades has been the realization that much, if not most, of the organic rain from the epipelagic to the abyss is due to direct sedimentation of aggregated phytoplankton, which does not appear to undergo consumption in the water column, and which may be related to seasonality of surface production cycles. Further, there is emerging evidence for benthic responses to sedimented phytodetritus, including apparent synchrony of reproductive cycles of some deep-sea benthic animals with seasonality of sinking of surface blooms. Such episodic input of surface phytodetritus may help resolve apparent discrepancies between average supply and demand of organic matter required to maintain benthic community metabolism. The sedimentary flux of fecal pellets, marine snow and sinking phytoplankton is an important component of the biological pump that not only transports and recycles materials in the sea but also may help scrub greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {The ‘‘biological pump’’ is the process by which photosynthetically-produced organic matter in the ocean descends from the surface layer to depth by a combination of sinking particles, advection or vertical mixing of dissolved organic matter, and transport by animals. Particulate organic matter that is exported downward from the euphotic zone is composed of combinations of fecal pellets from zooplankton and fish, organic aggregates known as ‘‘marine snow’’ and phytodetritus from sinking phytoplankton. Previous reviews by Turner and Ferrante (1979) and Turner (2002) focused on publications that appeared through late 2001. Since that time, studies of the biological pump have continued, and there have been {$>$}300 papers on vertical export flux using sediment traps, large-volume filtration systems and other techniques from throughout the global ocean. This review will focus primarily on recent studies that have appeared since 2001. Major topics covered in this review are (1) an overview of the biological pump, and its efficiency and variability, and the role of dissolved organic carbon in the biological pump; (2) zooplankton fecal pellets, including the contribution of zooplankton fecal pellets to export flux, epipelagic retention of zooplankton fecal pellets due to zooplankton activities, zooplankton vertical migration and fecal pellet repackaging, microbial ecology of fecal pellets, sinking velocities of fecal pellets and aggregates, ballasting of sinking particles by mineral contents, phytoplankton cysts, intact cells and harmful algae toxins in fecal pellets, importance of fecal pellets from various types of zooplankton, and the role of zooplankton fecal pellets in picoplankton export; (3) marine snow, including the origins, abundance, and distributions of marine snow, particles and organisms associated with marine snow, consumption and fragmentation of marine snow by animals, pathogens associated with marine snow; (4) phytodetritus, including pulsed export of phytodetritus, phytodetritus from Phaeocystis spp., picoplankton in phytodetritus, the summer export pulse (SEP) of phytodetritus in the subtropical North Pacific, benthic community responses to phytodetritus; (5) other components of the biological pump, including fish fecal pellets and fish-mediated export, sinking carcasses of animals and macrophytes, feces from marine mammals, transparent exopolymer particles (TEP); (6) the biological pump and climate, including origins of the biological pump, the biological pump and glacial/interglacial cycles, the biological pump and contemporary climate variations, and the biological pump and anthropogenic climate change. The review concludes with potential future modifications in the biological pump due to climate change.},

Here, using random shotgun sequencing of DNA from a natural acidophilic biofilm, we report reconstruction of near-complete genomes of Leptospirillum group II and Ferroplasma type II, and partial recovery of three other genomes. This was possible because the biofilm was dominated by a small number of species populations and the frequency of genomic rearrangements and gene insertions or deletions was relatively low. Because each sequence read came from a different individual, we could determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are the predominant form of heterogeneity at the strain level. The Leptospirillum group II genome had remarkably few nucleotide polymorphisms, despite the existence of low-abundance variants. The Ferroplasma type II genome seems to be a composite from three ancestral strains that have undergone homologous recombination to form a large population of mosaic genomes. Analysis of the gene complement for each organism revealed the pathways for carbon and nitrogen fixation and energy generation, and provided insights into survival strategies in an extreme environment.},

  abstract = {There is mounting speculation that overharvesting of oyster stocks (Crassostrea virginica) in Chesapeake Bay may be a factor contributing to the decline in water quality and shifts in the dominance of species inhabiting the estuary. The trophic consequences of increasing the oyster population may be addressed using a simple quasi-equilibrium, mass action model of the exchanges transpiring in the Chesapeake mesohaline ecosystem. According to output from the model, increasing oyster abundance would decrease phytoplankton productivity as well as stocks of pelagic microbes, ctenophores, medusae, and particulate organic carbon. Recently acquired field data on phytoplankton productivity, bacterioplankton, and labile organic carbon in the vicinity of rafted oyster aquaculture support model predictions. The model also indicates that more oysters should increase benthic primary production, fish stocks, and mesozooplankton densities. Hence, augmenting the oyster community by restoring beds or introducing raft culture represents a potentially significant adjunct to the goal of mitigating eutrophication through curtailment of nutrient inputs.},

Both communities were quantitatively very different. Attached bacteria represented only 6.8\% of the total bacterial abundance, whereas free-living bacteria represented 93.2\%. The environmental factors most closely linked to the abundance and activity of free-living bacteria were temperature and the concentration of dissolved nutrients. Moreover, the free-living community showed similar temporal variations in abundance and in activity, with lower values in the cold months (from October to May). The attached community did not present the same pattern of variation as the free-living one. The abundance of the attached bacteria was mainly correlated to the concentration of particulate material, whereas their activity was correlated to temperature. We did not find a significant correlation between the abundance and the activity of the attached community. On the other hand, the activity per cell of the two communities did not present a clear temporal variation. Attached bacteria were more active than free-living ones in the incorporation of radiolabeled substrates on a per cell basis (five times more in the case of glucose incorporation and twice as active in thymidine incorporation). However, both communities showed similar specific growth rates. The results suggest that the two aquatic bacterial communities must not be considered as being independent of each other. There appears to be a dynamic equilibrium between the two communities, regulated by the concentrations of particulate matter and nutrients and by other environmental factors.},

The D-ESP filters particulates from seawater at depths up to 4000 m and applies a variety of molecular assays to the particulates, including quantitative PCR (qPCR), to identify particular organisms and genes in situ. Preserved samples enable laboratory-based validation of in situ results and expanded studies of genomic diversity and gene expression. Tests of the D-ESP at a methane-rich mound in the Santa Monica Basin centered on detection of 16S rRNA and particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) genes for two putative aerobic methanotrophs. Comparison of in situ qPCR results with laboratory-based assays of preserved samples demonstrates the D-ESP generated high-quality qPCR data while operating autonomously on the seafloor. Levels of 16S rRNA and pmoA cDNA detected in preserved samples are consistent with an active community of aerobic methanotrophs near the methane-rich mound. These findings are substantiated at low methane sites off Point Conception and in Monterey Bay where target genes are at or below detection limits. Successful deployment of the D-ESP is a major step toward developing autonomous systems to facilitate a wide range of marine microbiological investigations.},

The present study tests the suitability of using a cost-efficient semi-automated classification methodology as a tool to assess zooplankton indicators for the purpose of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, using samples collected in the Baltic Sea. In this brackish ecosystem the zooplankton individuals are small-bodied and therefore their identification with semi-automated classification is challenging. However, results show that semi-automated zooplankton classification provides a taxonomic classification level that is sufficient for a number of proposed indicators. This analysis also points out weakness of the methodology and proposes already proved solutions based on the latest development of these methodologies applied to zooplankton classification. As proved in the Baltic Sea, complementing manual zooplankton analyses with the semi-automated classification offers new advantages for marine environment assessment.},

Based on physico-chemical properties of the water and topographical features, the transect was divided into three trophic areas, i.e. eutrophic, mesotrophic and oligotrophic ones. The average carbon biomass of the total plankton community was highest (438 mg m−3) in the inshore eutrophic area, and declined steeply offshore (141 and 26.6 mg m−3 in the mesotrophic and oligotrophic areas, respectively). In the offshore oligotrophic area, the relative biomass of BA to PP and the relative biomass of small heterotrophs (i.e. BA, HNF and MZ) to the total heterotrophs were higher than in the other areas, indicating that the microbial food chain predominated. In the mesotrophic area, the biomass of HNZ (primarily copepods) was conspicuously high, even higher than that of PP, suggesting that the traditional grazing food chain prevailed. Because of this short food chain, a productive fishing ground is formed there. In the eutrophic area, the biomass of HNZ was much smaller relative to the enormous biomass of PP, indicating that a considerable amount of primary production was not utilized directly by the metazoan zooplankton. However, the relative contribution of the small heterotrophs to the total heterotrophs’ biomass was higher in this area, as in the oligotrophic area.},

  abstract = {By adding a generic description of cost of resistance (COR) to the existing ‘killing-the-winner’ model, we show how this expands the model's explanatory power to include rank-abundance relationships in the host population. The model can predict a counter-intuitive relationship previously suggested in the literature, where abundant viruses are associated with rare hosts and vice versa. The model explains the observed dominance of slow-growing prokaryotes as the result of successful defence strategies, rather than as dormancy of hosts lacking essential substrates. In addition to these important conceptual aspects, the model is able to reproduce realistic values for virus\,:\,host ratios and partitioning of bacterial production between predatory loss and viral lysis. A high COR is also shown to increase the community's richness and Shannon diversity index. This model thus not only couples life strategies at the cellular level with system properties, but it also links the two system level properties of biogeochemical flows and diversity to each other. The model operates with host groups, and consequences for biodiversity when interpreting these groups in terms of species and strains are discussed.},

  abstract = {In compliance with Planetary Protection policy, NASA monitors the total  microbial burden of spacecraft and associated environments as a means for minimizing forward contamination. Despite numerous characterizations of microbial populations in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms, understanding the metabolic traits responsible for their persistence and survival remains a significant challenge. The principal objective of this study is to establish functional traits by exploring the entire gene content (metagenome) of the cleanroom microbial community. DNA-based techniques are incapable of distinguishing viable microorganisms from dead microbial cells in samples. Consequently, metagenomic analyses based on total environmental DNA extracts do not render a meaningful understanding of the metabolic and/or functional characteristics of living microorganisms in cleanrooms. A molecular viability marker was applied to samples collected from a cleanroom facility, and subsequent metagenomic sequencing experiments showed considerable differences between the resulting viable-only and total microbiomes. Nevertheless, analyses of sequence abundance suggested that the viable microbiome was influenced by both the human microbiome and the ambient ecosystem external to the facility, which resulted in a complex community profile. Also detected were the first viral signatures ever retrieved from a cleanroom facility: the genomes of human cyclovirus 7078A and Propionibacterium phage P14.4. We also wanted to evaluate if the strict cleaning and decontamination procedures selectively favor survival and growth of hardy microrganisms, such as pathogens. Three geographically distinct cleanrooms were sampled during the assembly of three NASA spacecraft: Dawn, Phoenix, and Mars Science Laboratory. Potential pathogens and their corresponding virulence factors were present in all the samples. Decreased microbial and pathogenic diversity during spacecraft assembly, compared to before and after, indicates that decontamination and preventative measures were effective and well implemented. The findings presented here, as well as the innovative methods that enabled their discovery, promise to have profound implications for the design and interpretation of ongoing and future studies in cleanrooms, indoor environments, and potential future human missions to Mars.},

Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1\% to 10\% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of spacecraft hardware was far more diverse than that observed in cleanrooms that housed mission-critical spacecraft hardware. The latter was dominated by hardy, robust organisms previously reported to survive in oligotrophic cleanroom environments. Presented here are the findings of the first ever comprehensive effort to assess the viability of cells in low-biomass environmental samples, and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation.},

Among the organisms isolated from spacecraft-associated surfaces, spores of Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 exhibited unusually high resistance to decontamination techniques such as UV radiation and peroxide treatment. Subsequently, B. pumilus SAFR-032 was flown to the International Space Station (ISS) and exposed to a variety of space conditions via the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF). After 18 months of exposure in the EXPOSE facility of the European Space Agency (ESA) on EuTEF under dark space conditions, SAFR-032 spores showed 10–40\% survivability, whereas a survival rate of 85–100\% was observed when these spores were kept aboard the ISS under dark simulated martian atmospheric conditions. In contrast, when UV ({$>$}110\,nm) was applied on SAFR-032 spores for the same time period and under the same conditions used in EXPOSE, a ∼7-log reduction in viability was observed. A parallel experiment was conducted on Earth with identical samples under simulated space conditions. Spores exposed to ground simulations showed less of a reduction in viability when compared with the “real space” exposed spores (∼3-log reduction in viability for “UV-Mars,” and ∼4-log reduction in viability for “UV-Space”). A comparative proteomics analysis indicated that proteins conferring resistant traits (superoxide dismutase) were present in higher concentration in space-exposed spores when compared to controls. Also, the first-generation cells and spores derived from space-exposed samples exhibited elevated UVC resistance when compared with their ground control counterparts. The data generated are important for calculating the probability and mechanisms of microbial survival in space conditions and assessing microbial contaminants as risks for forward contamination and in situ life detection.

  abstract = {Sediments in eutrophic estuarine ecosystems may become heavily enriched with organic carbon (OC). This OC is primarily of low reactivity and, therefore, has moderate effects on sediment biogeochemical cycling. Nonetheless, OC levels of {$>$}1\% reduce sediment stability and cause frequent resuspensions and high water turbidity, which affect the recovery of ecosystem functioning. Significant reduction of sediment OC content to {$<$}1\% is, therefore, needed before ecosystems can fully recover. It was investigated whether organic-rich sediments with 2.5 to 4.4\% OC (180–310 mol m–2) from the eutrophic Odense Fjord (Denmark) can recover by microbial degradation. Defaunated sediment cores from various habitats were subjected to long-term (\textasciitilde 2 yr) degradation experiments. Total OC content was measured initially and OC degradation was measured regularly from CO2 effluxes and closed anoxic sediment incubations. OC degradation was high initially, but faded exponentially at all stations before stabilizing at 6 to 15 mmol OC m−2 d−1 after 100 to 150 d. Hence, over the 2 yr experiment OC degradation corresponded to only 3 to 5\% reduction of initial OC. Temporal degradation patterns analyzed by exponential decay models suggested that sedimentary OC consisted of 2 pools with different reactivity plus a non-reactive pool. OC with the highest turnover (k = 0.5 × 10−2 to 5.5 × 10−2 d−1) was quantitatively the least important (0.3−4.3\% of total OC), while OC with lower reactivity (k = 0.1 × 10−3 to 2.0 × 10−3 d−1) constituted a higher proportion (4−58\% of total OC in organic-rich sediments). Furthermore, 43 to 95\% of sediment OC was non-degradable. Our results suggest that partial recovery (5−57\% reduction of initial OC) may occur within 23 to 50 yr. However, complete recovery of organic-rich sediments to {$<$}1\% OC seems unlikely due to large pools of non-reactive OC. Eutrophication, therefore, leads to irreversible OC accumulation in sediments, which prolongs the recovery time for estuarine ecosystems after reductions in nutrient loading.},

The seasonal and inter-annual variability in these indices is compared with changes observed in thermal stratification indices from monthly collected data over 5 years (June 1991 to June 1996). Copepods represent the main taxonomic group in the zooplankton assemblage in terms of abundance and persistence. Ordination of the samples by their similarity coefficients has a clear temporal meaning, and the clusters formed are linked to seasonal characteristics of the water column. Autocorrelation and spectral analysis of species richness and diversity show a 12-month periodic cycle throughout the time series, with a less important peak every 30 months. The long-term trends between these indices and the standard deviation of water column temperature (as an index of thermal stratification) are of opposite sign. The significant negative correlation between the pairs suggests a strong relationship between the maintenance of copepod diversity and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Evidence supporting a key role for anaerobic methane oxidation in the global methane cycle is reviewed. Emphasis is on recent microbiological advances. The driving force for research on this process continues to be the fact that microbial communities intercept and consume methane from anoxic environments, methane that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. Anaerobic methane oxidation is biogeochemically important because methane is a potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and is abundant in anoxic environments. Geochemical evidence for this process has been observed in numerous marine sediments along the continental margins, in methane seeps and vents, around methane hydrate deposits, and in anoxic waters. The anaerobic oxidation of methane is performed by at least two phylogenetically distinct groups of archaea, the ANME-1 and ANME-2. These archaea are frequently observed as consortia with sulfate-reducing bacteria, and the metabolism of these consortia presumably involves a syntrophic association based on interspecies electron transfer. The archaeal member of a consortium apparently oxidizes methane and shuttles reduced compounds to the sulfate-reducing bacteria. Despite recent advances in understanding anaerobic methane oxidation, uncertainties still remain regarding the nature and necessity of the syntrophic association, the biochemical pathway of methane oxidation, and the interaction of the process with the local chemical and physical environment. This review will consider the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of anaerobic methane oxidation with a special emphasis on the interactions between the responsible organisms and their environment.},

  abstract = {Predators’ switching towards the most abundant prey is a mechanism that stabilizes population dynamics and helps overcome competitive exclusion of species in food webs. Current formulations of active prey-switching, however, display non-maximal feeding in which the predators’ total ingestion decays exponentially with the number prey species (i.e. the diet breadth) even though the total prey biomass stays constant. We analyse three previously published multi-species functional responses which have either active switching or maximal feeding, but not both. We identify the cause of this apparent incompatibility and describe a kill-the-winner formulation that combines active switching with maximal feeding. Active switching is shown to be a community response in which some predators become prey-selective and the formulations with maximal or non-maximal feeding are implicitly assuming different food web configurations. Global simulations using a marine ecosystem model with 64 phytoplankton species belonging to 4 major functional groups show that the species richness and biogeography of phytoplankton are very sensitive to the choice of the functional response for grazing. The phytoplankton biogeography reflects the balance between the competitive abilities for nutrient uptake and the degree of apparent competition which occurs indirectly between species that share a common predator species. The phytoplankton diversity significantly increases when active switching is combined with maximal feeding through predator-mediated coexistence.},

  abstract = {Determining how microbial communities organize and function at the ecosystem level is essential to understanding and predicting how they will respond to environmental change. Mathematical models can be used to describe these communities, but properly representing all the biological interactions in extremely diverse natural microbial ecosystems in a mathematical model is challenging. We examine a complementary approach based on the maximum entropy production (MEP) principle, which proposes that systems with many degrees of freedom will likely organize to maximize the rate of free energy dissipation. In this study, we develop an MEP model to describe biogeochemistry observed in Siders Pond, a phosphate limited meromictic system located in Falmouth, MA that exhibits steep chemical gradients due to density-driven stratification that supports anaerobic photosynthesis as well as microbial communities that catalyze redox cycles involving O, N, S, Fe and Mn. The MEP model uses a metabolic network to represent microbial redox reactions, where biomass allocation and reaction rates are determined by solving an optimization problem that maximizes entropy production over time, and a 1D vertical profile constrained by an advection-dispersion-reaction model. We introduce a new approach for modeling phototrophy and explicitly represent oxygenic photoautotrophs, photoheterotrophs and anoxygenic photoautotrophs. The metabolic network also includes reactions for aerobic organoheterotrophic bacteria, sulfate reducing bacteria, sulfide oxidizing bacteria and aerobic and anaerobic grazers. Model results were compared to observations of biogeochemical constituents collected over a 24 hour period at 8 depths at a single 15 m deep station in Siders Pond. Maximizing entropy production over long (3 day) intervals produced results more similar to field observations than short (0.25 day) interval optimizations, which support the importance of temporal strategies for maximizing entropy production over time. Furthermore, we found that entropy production must be maximized locally instead of globally where energy potentials are degraded quickly by abiotic processes, such as light absorption by water. This combination of field observations and modeling results indicate that natural microbial systems can be modeled by using the maximum entropy production principle applied over time and space using many fewer parameters than conventional models.},

(2) What is new about the inequality of access to and use of ICTs as compared to other scarce material and immaterial resources? (3) Do new types of inequality exist or rise in the information society? The results of digital divide research are classified under four successive types of access: motivational, physical, skills and usage. A shift of attention from physical access to skills and usage is observed. In terms of physical access the divide seems to be closing in the most developed countries; concerning digital skills and the use of applications the divide persists or widens. Among the shortcomings of digital divide research are its lack of theory, conceptual definition, interdisciplinary approach, qualitative research and longitudinal research.},

Attempts to intervene in these blooms can be met with reticence by citizens, non-governmental organizations, and officials, often due to local perceptions and beliefs. Hence, the social sciences have an important role to play in HAB research and mitigation. Much of the social science HAB research to date has focused on how best to communicate associated risks and appropriate behavioral responses to affected local communities. The emphasis has been on the direct human impacts, particularly in the areas of health outcomes and identification of any sociocultural and economic barriers to proposed mitigation. While this focus is warranted and valuable, there is also a need to understand HABs as part of a larger human–environmental coupled system, where blooms trigger a wide range of cultural and behavioral responses that are driven by how blooms impact other social and ecosystem dynamics. The research presented here describes a case study of a Microcystis aeruginosa bloom in a lake in the Chesapeake Bay watershed where anthropologists worked with HAB researchers. The results of this interdisciplinary collaboration show that approaching the bloom and mitigation within a ‘socio-ecological systems’ framework provides stakeholders with a range of rationales and approaches for addressing HAB mitigation, enhancing both short-term successes and longer-term opportunities, even if M. aeruginosa is still present in the lake.},

As a result, many microbial ecology investigations continue to suffer from a lack of appropriate replication. We evaluated two fingerprinting approaches - terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) against 454 pyrosequencing, by applying them to 225 polar soil samples from East Antarctica and the high Arctic. By incorporating local and global spatial scales into the dataset our aim was to determine whether various approaches differed in their ability and hence utility, to identify ecological patterns. Through the reduction of the 454 sequencing data to the most dominant OTUs, we revealed that a surprisingly small proportion of abundant OTUs ({$<$} 0.25\%) were driving the biological patterns observed. Overall, ARISA and T-RFLP had a similar capacity as sequencing to separate samples according to distance at a local scale, and to correlate environmental variables with microbial community structure. Pyrosequencing had a greater resolution at the global scale but all methods were capable of significantly differentiating the polar sites. We conclude fingerprinting remains a legitimate approach to generating large datasets as well as a cost effective rapid method to identify samples for elucidating taxonomic information or diversity estimates with sequencing methods.This article is protected by copyright.

The attenuation coefficient (b) for the flux was found to be 0.40 versus the composite value of 0.86 determined by Martin et al. (1987). To examine this further, sinking POC was collected using sediment traps and allowed to degrade in oxic and suboxic experiments. Using a kinetic model, it was found that degradation proceeded at similar rates (roughly 0.8 day−1) under oxic and suboxic conditions, but a greater fraction of bulk POC was resistant to degradation in the suboxic experiments (61\% vs. 23\%). Amino acids accounted for 37\% of POC collected at 75m, but following degradation the value dropped to 17\% and 16\% in the oxic and suboxic experiments respectively. POC collected from 500m was 10\% amino acids. The non-AA component of POC collected at 75m was not degraded under suboxic conditions, while under oxic conditions it was. These results suggest that microbes degrading OC under suboxic conditions via denitrification preferentially utilize nitrogen-rich amino acids. This preferential degradation of amino acids suggests that 9\% more nitrogen may be lost via water column denitrification than is accounted for when a more “Redfieldian” stoichiometry for POC is assumed.},

Other major groups of siliceous plankton—the diatoms and radiolarians—exhibit evidence of decreasing size or silicification over the Cenozoic. We investigated trends in the silicoflagellate fossil record by constructing a species-level database of diversity and morphological metrics. This new database reveals a proliferation of silicoflagellate species with spined skeletons along with an increase in the mean number of spines per species over the Cenozoic. Although there is little change in skeleton size or silicification among species with spines, those without spines are larger than species with spines and exhibit a decrease in size toward the present. Increased grazing pressure combined with declining surface silicate availability may have shifted the costs and benefits of silicification, causing divergent responses in skeletal morphology between these different morphological lineages of silicoflagellates over time. We postulate that diminishing Cenozoic surface silicic acid availability may have predisposed large spineless silicoflagellate species to extinction, whereas increased grazing pressure may have contributed to the extinction of all remaining spineless species within the edible size range of grazers.},

  abstract = {Intricate relationships between microorganisms structure the exchange of molecules between taxa, driving their physiology and evolution. On a global scale, this molecular trade is an integral component of biogeochemical cycling. As important microorganisms in the world’s oceans, diatoms and bacteria have a large impact on marine biogeochemistry. Here, we describe antagonistic effects of the globally distributed flavobacterium Croceibacter atlanticus on a phylogenetically diverse group of diatoms. We used the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to study the antagonistic impact in more detail. In co-culture, C. atlanticus attaches to T. pseudonana and inhibits cell division, inducing diatom cells to become larger and increase in chlorophyll a fluorescence. These changes could be explained by an absence of cytokinesis that causes individual T. pseudonana cells to elongate, accumulate more plastids and become polyploid. These morphological changes could benefit C. atlanticus by augmenting the colonizable surface area of the diatom, its photosynthetic capabilities and possibly its metabolic secretions.},

  abstract = {The contribution of Chloroflexi-type SAR202 cells to total picoplankton and bacterial abundance and uptake of D- and L-aspartic acids (Asp) was determined in the different meso- and bathypelagic water masses of the (sub)tropical Atlantic (from 35 degrees N to 5 degrees S). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that the overall abundance of SAR202 was {$<$} or = 1 x 10(3) cells ml(-1) in subsurface waters (100 m layer), increasing in the mesopelagic zone to 3 x 10(3) cells ml(-1) and remaining fairly constant down to 4000 m depth. Overall, the percentage of total picoplankton identified as SAR202 increased from {$<$} 1\% in subsurface waters to 10-20\% in the bathypelagic waters. On average, members of the SAR202 cluster accounted for about 30\% of the Bacteria in the bathypelagic waters, whereas in the mesopelagic and subsurface waters, SAR202 cells contributed {$<$} 5\% to total bacterial abundance. The ratio of D-Asp : L-Asp uptake by the bulk picoplankton community increased from the subsurface layer (D-Asp : L-Asp uptake ratio approximately 0.03) to the deeper layers reaching a ratio of approximately 1 at 4000 m depth. Combining FISH with microautoradiography to determine the proportion of SAR202 cells taking up D-Asp versus L-Asp, we found that approximately 30\% of the SAR202 cells were taking up L-Asp throughout the water column while D-Asp was essentially not taken up by SAR202. This D-Asp : L-Asp uptake pattern of SAR202 cells is in contrast to that of the bulk bacterial and crenarchaeal community in the bathypelagic ocean, both sustaining a higher fraction of D-Asp-positive cells than L-Asp-positive cells. Thus, although the Chloroflexi-type SAR202 constitutes a major bathypelagic bacterial cluster, it does not contribute to the large fraction of d-Asp utilizing prokaryotic community in the meso- and bathypelagic waters of the North Atlantic, but rather utilizes preferentially L-amino acids.},

Eukaryotic ribosomal diversity saturated at \textasciitilde 150,000 operational taxonomic units, about one-third of which could not be assigned to known eukaryotic groups. Diversity emerged at all taxonomic levels, both within the groups comprising the \textasciitilde 11,200 cataloged morphospecies of eukaryotic plankton and among twice as many other deep-branching lineages of unappreciated importance in plankton ecology studies. Most eukaryotic plankton biodiversity belonged to heterotrophic protistan groups, particularly those known to be parasites or symbiotic hosts.},

These cells were then stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and counted by epifluorescent microscopy. The technique of strengthening the cells with an aldehyde and then dispersing them in a suspending medium using a deflocculent (pyrophosphate) and ultrasound caused the bacteria to be randomly distributed when filtered onto Nuclepore membranes with a lower variance within and similar variance between subsamples as compared with untreated samples. In most cases the coefficient of variation stabilized after the bacterial cells in 10 randomly chosen microscopic fields had been counted. Sediment bacterial numbers (±SE) determined by the standard technique were 5.20 (±0.36)\hspace{0.6em}×\hspace{0.6em}1010 per gram wet weight; by this dispersion technique they were 11.30 (±0.24)\hspace{0.6em}×\hspace{0.6em}1011 per gram, a greater than twofold increase. On young and intermediate aged kelp blades, the increased counts which resulted from this dispersion technique ranged from two- to five-fold.

As such, it is a necessary requirement to identify possible hotspots in the early stages of any disease. Based on previous studies carried out on coronaviruses, there is a high likelihood that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may also survive in wastewater.

Natural samples of the lichen Xanthoria elegans were used to investigate their ability to survive the applied Mars-like conditions. The effects of atmospheric pressure, CO2 concentration, low temperature, water availability, and light on Mars were also studied. The results of these experiments indicate that  no significant decrease in the vitality of the lichen occurred after exposure to simulated martian conditions, which was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, and a 95\% CO2 atmosphere with 100\% humidity, low pressure (partial pressure of CO2 was 600\,Pa), and low temperature has a balancing effect on photosynthetic activity as a function of temperature. This means a starting low photosynthetic activity at high CO2 concentrations with Earth-like pressure has a reduction of 60\%. But, if the simulated atmospheric pressure is reduced to Mars-like conditions with the maintenance of the same Mars-like 95\% CO2 concentration, the photosynthetic activity increases and again reaches similar values as those exhibited under terrestrial atmospheric pressure and concentration.  Based on these results, we presume that, in any region on Mars where liquid water might be available, even for short periods of time, a eukaryotic symbiotic organism would have the ability to survive, at least over weeks, and to temporarily photosynthesize.

We sought to use this information to understand the evolution and ecology of bacterioplankton at our long-term study site in the Western Sargasso Sea. A bioinformatics pipeline called PhyloAssigner was developed to align pyrosequencing reads to a reference multiple sequence alignment of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and assign them phylogenetic positions in a reference tree using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Here, we used this pipeline to investigate the ecologically important SAR11 clade of Alphaproteobacteria. A combined set of 2.7 million pyrosequencing reads from the 16S rRNA V1-V2 regions, representing 9 years at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site, was quality checked and parsed into a comprehensive bacterial tree, yielding 929\,036 Alphaproteobacteria reads. Phylogenetic structure within the SAR11 clade was linked to seasonally recurring spatiotemporal patterns. This analysis resolved four new SAR11 ecotypes in addition to five others that had been described previously at BATS. The data support a conclusion reached previously that the SAR11 clade diversified by subdivision of niche space in the ocean water column, but the new data reveal a more complex pattern in which deep branches of the clade diversified repeatedly across depth strata and seasonal regimes. The new data also revealed the presence of an unrecognized clade of Alphaproteobacteria, here named SMA-1 (Sargasso Mesopelagic Alphaproteobacteria, group 1), in the upper mesopelagic zone. The high-resolution phylogenetic analyses performed herein highlight significant, previously unknown, patterns of evolutionary diversification, within perhaps the most widely distributed heterotrophic marine bacterial clade, and strongly links to ecosystem regimes.},

Over 100 monthly bacterioplankton DNA samples, from each depth, were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequences parsed with the custom software package PhyloAssigner. Co-occurrence networks, filtered for potential autocorrelation artifacts, were constructed for each depth. Network characteristics for the 2 depths were remarkably similar, and network parameters, such as connectance, were in the same range as previously published for ecological networks. Spectral clustering applied to similarity matrices based on exact connections revealed clusters of nodal taxonomic units (NTUs) that peaked at similar times, supporting deterministic, niche-based assembly. An algorithm that used hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) to model neutral communities based on learned parameters indicated that community assembly processes fit niche-based models at the metacommunity level for both depths. However, HDP analyses restricted to SAR11, SAR86, or SAR202 NTUs supported the neutral assembly hypothesis, suggesting that neutral process models may apply within some phylogenetic domains. To understand whether phylogenetically related taxa can substitute for one another in networks, we created a new metric, phylogenetically weighted connectivity, which considered the similarity of connections among near phylogenetic neighbors. This analysis suggested that phylogenetically similar lineages share similar network connections. Overall, our findings show that niche-based community assembly models are the best fit at both depths but that the neutral model may apply at some phylogenetic scales.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Spatiotemporal distributions of rare microbial taxa were examined in 384 samples from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site, in the northwestern Sargasso Sea. Sequences were partitioned into 6 mutually exclusive sets based on abundance (abundant, rare, and very rare) and frequency of detection (frequent and infrequent). Analyses of variance for taxa that were frequently present, across all levels of abundance, demonstrated environmental filtering, indicating that gradients in environmental factors, such as season and depth, drive community assembly for rare taxa, as they do for abundant taxa. All abundant nodal taxonomic units (NTUs) had spatiotemporal periods of rarity, providing a clear demonstration of the role of fluctuating reproductive success in population dynamics, and the role of rare populations as seed banks. An inverse relationship between the number of rare taxa and physical stratification indicates that transport by mixing drives increased community diversity throughout most of the year. Populations of selected copiotrophic taxa varied in episodic patterns that were not tightly entrained to season and depth, indicating that these populations are not governed by the same rules of community assembly that apply to most other taxa and may be adapted to exploit infrequent, unknown disturbances. Overall, the findings support the perspective that the success of most rare populations was driven by the same fundamental patterns of spatiotemporal variation that drove the success of dominant populations, but also indicate potentially important roles for transport by mixing and atypical life histories in determination of community composition.},

  abstract = {The Academic Job Search Handbook is the comprehensive guide to finding a faculty position in any discipline. Building on the groundbreaking success and unique offerings of earlier volumes, the fifth edition presents insightful new content on aspects of the search at all stages. Beginning with an overview of academic careers and institutional structures, it moves step by step through the application process, from establishing relationships with advisors, positioning oneself in the market, learning about job openings, preparing CVs, cover letters, and other application materials, to negotiating offers. Of great value are the sixty new sample documents from a diverse spectrum of successful applicants. The handbook includes a search timetable, appendices of career resources, and a full sample application package. This fifth edition features new or updated sections on issues of current interest, such as job search concerns for pregnant or international candidates, the use of social media strategies to address CV gaps, and difficulties faced by dual-career couples. The chapter on alternatives to faculty jobs has been expanded and presents sample résumés of PhDs who found nonfaculty positions.For more than twenty years, The Academic Job Search Handbook has assisted job seekers in all academic disciplines in the search for faculty positions at different kinds of institutions from research-focused universities to community colleges. Current faculty who used the book themselves recommend it to their own students and postdocs. The many new first-person narratives provide insight into issues and situations candidates may encounter such as applying for an international job, combining parenting with an academic career, going from an administrative job to a faculty position, and seeking faculty positions as a same-sex couple.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an estimation of the accumulated detection rates and the accumulated number of infected individuals by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Worldwide, on July 20, it has been estimated above 160 million individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it is found that only about 1 out of 11 infected individuals are detected. In an information context in which population-based seroepidemiological studies are not frequently available, this study shows a parsimonious alternative to provide estimates of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. By comparing our estimates with those provided by the population-based seroepidemiological ENE-COVID study in Spain, we confirm the utility of our approach. Then, using a cross-country regression, we investigated if differences in detection rates are associated with differences in the cumulative number of deaths. The hypothesis investigated in this study is that higher levels of detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections can reduce the risk exposure of the susceptible population with a relatively higher risk of death. Our results show that, on average, detecting 5 instead of 35 percent of the infections is associated with multiplying the number of deaths by a factor of about 6. Using this result, we estimated that 120 days after the pandemic outbreak, if the US would have tested with the same intensity as South Korea, about 85,000 out of their 126,000 reported deaths could have been avoided.},

Their influence on global ocean circulation is well known, but their role in plankton transport is largely unexplored. We show that, although the coarse taxonomic structure of plankton communities is continuous across the Agulhas choke point, South Atlantic plankton diversity is altered compared with Indian Ocean source populations. Modeling and in situ sampling of a young Agulhas ring indicate that strong vertical mixing drives complex nitrogen cycling, shaping community metabolism and biogeochemical signatures as the ring and associated plankton transit westward. The peculiar local environment inside Agulhas rings may provide a selective mechanism contributing to the limited dispersal of Indian Ocean plankton populations into the Atlantic.},

A brief review of ‘active’ sludge tracers is followed by a more extensive review of ‘passive’ sludge tracers. These can be broken down into five categories: (1) Natural organic components of sludge — organic carbon, faecal steroids, carbohydrate/TOC ratio, tomato seeds. (2) Synthetic organic compounds — silicones, chlorinated hydrocarbons, non-ionic surfactants and their degradation products, linear alkylbenzenes. (3) Stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and sulphur. (4) Inorganic substances and their properties — minerals, paint pigments, trace elements, magnetic properties. (5) Biological/Microbiological — faecal bacteria, Clostridium welchii spores, amoebae, viruses, nitrogen-fixing enterobacteriacae. A wide variety of sludge tracers are available with the choice of suitable tracers in an individual situation governed by the available equipment and expertise, cost considerations, ease of sampling requirements and determination, and the nature of other pollutants inputs in the vicinity of the input of interest. Ideally, the sludge tracers chosen should be unique to the input of interest, but this will rarely be achievable in practice. In areas of gross sludge contamination, a marine geophysical survey technique can be used to delineate the area affected and this provides a rapid cost-effective method for large areas.},

  abstract = {Increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide is altering marine carbonate chemistry through a process called ocean acidification. Many calcium carbonate forming organisms are sensitive to changes in marine carbonate chemistry, especially mollusk bivalve larvae at the initial shell building stage. Rapid calcification, limited energy reserves, and more exposed calcification surfaces, are traits at this stage that increase vulnerability to ocean acidification through our previously argued kinetic-energetic hypothesis. These developmental traits are common to broadcast spawning bivalve species that are the focus of most ocean acidification studies to date. Some oyster species brood their young, which results in slower development of the embryos through the initial shell formation stage. We examined the responses of the brooding Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, during their initial shell building stage. We extracted fertilized eggs from, O. lurida, prior to shell development, then exposed developing embryos to a wide range of marine carbonate chemistry conditions. Surprisingly, O. lurida showed no acute negative response to any ocean acidification treatments. Compared to the broadcast spawning Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, calcification rate and standardized endogenous energy lipid consumption rate were nearly 10 and 50 times slower, respectively. Our results suggest that slow shell building may lessen the energetic burden of acidification at this stage and provides additional support for our kinetic-energetic hypothesis. Furthermore, these results may represent an example of exaptation; fitness conveyed by a coopted trait that evolved for another purpose, a concept largely lacking in the current perspective of adaptation and global climate change.},

  abstract = {Coastal upwelling zones are among the most productive regions in the world and play a major role in the global carbon cycle. Radiocarbon (as Δ14C) is a powerful tool for tracing the source and fate of suspended particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM, DOM), and has the potential to reconcile key carbon budgets within upwelling systems. However, the extent to which upwelling processes influence the Δ14C signature of surface DIC, or that of POM or DOM remains almost completely unknown. Here we present a time series of stable carbon (δ13C) and Δ14C isotopic data of major water column carbon pools, including dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), large (0.7–500 μm) and small (0.1–100 μm) POM, and high molecular weight (HMW; ∼1 nm–0.1 μm) DOM from an upwelling center along the Big Sur coast. We show that DIC Δ14C values (ranging between +29‰ and −14‰) are strongly correlated to coastal upwelling processes, and that this 14C-signal readily propagates into both the POM and HMW DOM pool. However, the presence of negative POM and HMW DOM Δ14C values (ranging between +46‰ and −56‰, +6‰ and −123‰ and −1‰ and −150‰, respectively) suggests contributions of “pre-aged” OM, complicating the direct use of “bulk” Δ14C for tracing upwelling-derived carbon production/export. Using a triple-isotope mixing model (δ13C, δ15N, Δ14C) we estimate that 50–90\% and 45–51\% of large and small POM is newly-produced OM, while between 6–22\% and 12–44\% of large and small POM are derived from “pre-aged” re-suspended sediments. Finally, we observe quantitative relationships between OM size, composition (C:N ratio) and Δ14C within this upwelling system, possibly representing a new tool for modeling ocean C and N biogeochemical cycles.},

Although inhospitable to metazoan life, they support a cryptic microbiota whose metabolic activities affect nutrient and trace gas cycling within the global ocean. Here, we report metagenomic analyses of a ubiquitous and abundant but uncultivated oxygen minimum zone microbe (SUP05) related to chemoautotrophic gill symbionts of deep-sea clams and mussels. The SUP05 metagenome harbors a versatile repertoire of genes mediating autotrophic carbon assimilation, sulfur oxidation, and nitrate respiration responsive to a wide range of water-column redox states.

In this study, we sampled bacterial communities in early and late successional temperate forests in Northeast China, and used distance-based redundancy analysis to examine how different processes influence bacterial beta diversity and phylogeny-based beta diversity using the Bray–Curtis and UniFrac metrics, respectively. After controlling for sampling effects, bacterial beta diversity in both forests was higher than expected by chance, which indicates that the bacterial community showed strong intraspecific aggregation. Both environmental filtering and dispersal limitation contributed to bacterial beta diversity and phylogeny-based beta diversity in the two forests. However, the relative importance of these different processes varied between the two forests. In the early successional forest, dispersal limitation played a dominant role in structuring the bacterial community, whereas the effects of environmental filtering were more important in the late successional forest. Our study revealed that bacterial beta diversity and phylogeny-based beta diversity in forest communities from the same region are regulated by different forces and that the relative importance of different forces varies over succession.},

In this study, quantity and richness of culturable heterotrophic bacteria (CHB) in seawater of the farming environment and guts of the oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis were determined monthly, with classical, biochemical, and molecular methods. About 800 randomly selected bacterial strains were purified and identified. Quantities of CHB and vibrios, ranging from 2.3 3103 to 2.2 3105 CFU/ml and 1.6 3102 to 3.0 3103 CFU/ml, respectively, were present in the farming seawater, whereas those in the oyster C. hongkongensis ranged from 5.3 3104 to 5.4 3106 CFU/g and 6.0 3103 to 1.4 3105 CFU/g, respectively. Vibrio spp., Pseudoalteromonas spp., Bacillus spp., and Shewanella spp. appeared almost every month. Richness of heterotrophic microbial communities of the seawater and the oysters was very similar and peaked in August. Variation in the diversity (Shannon index) of CHB in the seawater and in the oysters was similar, a significant positive correlation was showed between them (r ¼ 0.894), and their diversities were both peaked in August. Statistical analysis showed that salinity has more important impact on quantity of CHB in seawater. Similarly, temperature had more important impact on that in the oysters. Important threshold data were analyzed to further explain the relationships.},

  abstract = {Although hypoxia has been well-studied in Chesapeake Bay, little attention has been given to the origin of the particulate organic matter (POM) that potentially contributes to early summer hypoxia. A combination of a high-resolution baroclinic physical model and a Lagrangian particle tracking model was used to study the sources of POM to the deep channel of the mesohaline Chesapeake Bay. The circulation model reasonably reproduced the salinity structure and circulation compared with observations. The particle tracking model was improved with a fast search algorithm, and a predict-correct method was developed in the backward tracking model to ensure a similar trajectory with the forward tracking. Backward tracking results revealed that the pathway of the POM has a strong dependence on the tracking initiation time and location of the particles, as well as the magnitude of the sinking speed. In general, the behavior of the POM trajectories can be explained by the three-dimensional residual circulation of the mesohaline mainstem Chesapeake Bay. The particles that accumulated in the deep channel of the upper mesohaline Chesapeake Bay where the onset of hypoxia occurs mainly come from downstream when particles stop tracking when they backtracked to the surface layer. Downstream sources accounted for roughly 83.5\% of particles for a sinking speed of 1 m/day, and the proportion from the downstream decreased to 60.5\% as the sinking speed increased to 25 m/day. In addition, the source from the eastern shore was larger than that from the western shore for particle sinking speed less than 8 m/day. Moreover, particles from the Potomac estuary with a sinking speed of 1 m/day can contribute 7.4\% of the bottom POM accumulation in the upper mesohaline Chesapeake Bay. When particles were allowed to stay on the surface for a period before they sink, they backtracked to the upper Chesapeake Bay suggesting that more long-lived refractory organic particles originating from the upper Bay can contribute to organic matter accumulation in the deep channel. These results help to explain why hypoxia in the deep channel of the upper mesohaline Bay occurs to the north of the primary production maximum and also why hypoxia is earlier and more severe in this region compared to the rest of hypoxic zone. Overall, the model results suggest that more local sources of POM with relatively high sinking rates are most important in driving oxygen depletion. This study improves understanding of the origin and pathways of the POM that can potentially contribute to the development of hypoxia in the deep channel of the mesohaline Chesapeake Bay. Future studies need to be undertaken to better understand the relative importance of remote versus more local sources of organic matter in driving oxygen drawdown.},

In this study, retail oysters were collected from local market in different seasons. The seasonal dynamics and diversity of bacteria in oyster tissues, including the gills, digestive glands and residual tissues, were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). It was interesting that the highest bacterial diversity appeared in the Fall season, not in summer. Our results indicated that Proteobacteria was the predominant member (23/46) in oyster tissues. Our results also suggested that bacterial diversity in gills was higher than that in digestive glands and other tissues. In addition, not all the bacteria collected from surrounding water by gills were transferred to digestive glands. On the other hand, few bacteria were found in oyster tissues except in the gills. Therefore, the gills could be the best candidate target tissue for monitoring of pathogenic bacteria either to human or to oyster.},

After 3 days of incubation at 27 MPa, the natural bacterial deep-sea community was dominated by one phylum of the genus Exiguobacterium, indicating the rapid selection of piezotolerant bacteria.

To begin addressing these questions, we characterized microbial dynamics weekly for 3 years at a temperate, coastal site with dramatic environmental seasonality. This high-resolution time series reveals that changes in microbial community composition are not continuous; over the duration of the time series, the community instead resolves into distinct summer and winter profiles with rapid spring and fall transitions between these states. Here, we show that these community shifts involve switching between closely related strains that exhibit either summer or winter preferences. Moreover, taxa repeat this process annually in both this and another temperate coastal time series, suggesting that this phenomenon may be widespread in marine ecosystems. To address potential biogeochemical impacts of these community changes, PICRUSt-based metagenomes predict seasonality in transporters, photosynthetic proteins, peptidases and carbohydrate metabolic pathways in spite of closely related summer- and winter-associated taxa. Thus, even small temperature shifts, such as those predicted by climate change models, could affect both the structure and function of marine ecosystems.},

The theoretical foundations of stream ecology often do not reflect fully the crucial roles of spatial complexity and fluvial dynamics in natural river ecosystems, which has hindered conceptual advances and the effectiveness of efforts at conservation and restoration.3. Inclusion of surface waters (lotic and lentic), subsurface waters (hyporheic and phreatic), riparian systems (in both constrained and floodplain reaches), and the ecotones between them (e.g. springs) as interacting components contributing to total biodiversity, is crucial for developing a holistic framework of rivers as ecosystems.4. Measures of species diversity, including alpha, beta and gamma diversity, are a result of disturbance history, resource partitioning, habitat fragmentation and successional phenomena across the riverine landscape. A hierarchical approach to diversity in natural and altered river-floodplain ecosystems will enhance understanding of ecological phenomena operating at different scales along multidimensional environmental gradients.5. Re-establishing functional diversity (e.g. hydrologic and successional processes) across the active corridor could serve as the focus of river conservation initiatives. Once functional processes have been reconstituted, habitat heterogeneity will increase, followed by corresponding increases in species diversity of aquatic and riparian biota.},

Similarly, striking advances have been made in marine microbial ecology using molecular techniques and metagenomics, and actinobacteria emerge as an often significant, sometimes even dominant, environmental clade. Both approaches — cultivation methods and molecular techniques — are leading to new insights into marine actinobacterial biodiversity and biogeography. Very different views of actinobacterial diversity emerge from these, however, and the true extent and biogeography of this are still not clear.

The ratios in which N, P, and Fe are delivered to the surface ocean, relative to the demands of the phytoplankton community, define several biogeochemical provinces in terms of the limiting nutrients and the presence or absence of diazotrophs. Nutrient supply ratios provided by a global ecosystem model support the theoretical view that diazotroph biogeography is dominated by the Fe : N supply ratio, with the P : N supply ratio taking an important secondary role. The theory yields robust predictions for which strong empirical support is found in global observations of surface nutrient concentrations and diazotroph abundance.},

Here, we examine this theory in a more realistic context using a size-structured global ocean food-web model, together with a much simplified version of the same model for which equilibrium solutions are readily obtained. Both models include the same basic assumptions: allometric scaling of physiological traits and size-selective zoo-plankton grazing. According to the equilibrium model, grazing places a limit on the phytoplankton biomass within each size-class, while the supply rate of essential nutrients limits the number of coexisting size classes, and hence the total biomass, in the system. The global model remains highly consistent with this conceptual view in the large-scale, annual average sense, but reveals more complex behaviour at shorter timescales, when phytoplankton and zooplankton growth may become decoupled. In particular, we show temporal and spatial scale dependence between total phytoplankton biomass and two key ecosystem properties: the zooplankton-to-phytoplankton ratio, and the partitioning of biomass among different size classes.},

  abstract = {The scales of temporal variability in the rate of ammonium oxidation and a suite of related biogeochemical parameters were investigated in the surface layer of the water column of Monterey Bay, California, on the west coast of the USA. Samples were collected on bimonthly (approx. every 2 mo) cruises during the course of 2 yr. The signal of El Nifio was evident in the water column temperature and nitrate distributions during the initial cruise in February 1998. Throughout the 2 yr period, variation in temperature and salinity was small and consistent with seasonal upwelling. The biological parameters, however, varied much more than might have been predicted by the minimal variability in hydrographic signals. Ammonium assimilation rates, chlorophyll a concentrations and bacterial abundance varied by 41-, 65- and 147-fold, respectively. Ammonium oxidation rates often exhibited a subsurface maximum near the bottom of the euphotic zone, and varied by a factor of 4.5 over the 2 yr study. The presence of the rate maximum was not obviously related to the dominant seasonal signals of hydrography or to other biological variables. Nitrification rates were much less variable in the bay than in Elkhorn Slough, a small estuary that opens onto the bay. The small variability in ammonium oxidation rates may be related to more dynamic responses in the community composition of the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Different groups of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were detected as dominants in clone libraries from the Monterey Bay and Elkhorn Slough. The time scale of bimonthly sampling was evidently inadequate to resolve the response of nitrification rates to direct physical forcing in the bay.},

  abstract = {The arcsine square root transformation has long been standard procedure when analyzing proportional data in ecology, with applications in data sets containing binomial and non-binomial response variables. Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

This study considers what is being implicitly assumed about the mean–variance relationship in distance-based analyses – multivariate analyses based on a matrix of pairwise distances – and what the effect is of any misspecification of the mean–variance relationship.3. It is shown that distance-based analyses make implicit assumptions that are typically out-of-step with what is observed in real data, which has major consequences.4. Potential consequences of this mean–variance misspecification are: confounding location and dispersion effects in ordinations; misleading results when trying to identify taxa in which an effect is expressed; failure to detect a multivariate effect unless it is expressed in high-variance taxa.5. Data transformation does not solve the problem.6. A solution is to use generalised linear models and their recent multivariate generalisations, which is shown here to have desirable properties.},

  abstract = {Marine bacteriophages impact global biogeochemical cycles via their influence on host community structure and function, yet our understanding of viral ecology is constrained by limitations in culturing of important hosts and the lack of a 'universal' gene to facilitate community surveys. While recent advances in short-read viral metagenomics offer solutions, they are confounded by microdiversity issues and fail to assemble over genomic islands (GIs). Single-virus genomics can overcome such issues by targeted sequencing of single virus particles, but is technically challenging and costly to implement. Another approach would be to leverage long-read sequencing technologies to bridge GIs and connect SNPs within populations, but current technologies require far too much input material (micrograms) and have high error rates. Here we sought to establish a generalizable, long-read, low-input metagenomic sequencing approach (VirION) to survey viruses in nature and applied it to nanogram concentrations of DNA from mock and natural viral communities. These experiments showed that our VirION method (i) is as relatively quantitative as short-read methods, (ii) captured many abundant and ubiquitous viral genomes that short reads did not, (iii) significantly increased median contig lengths and captured a complete 316 kbp viral genome - 100 kbp longer than the current longest genome from Global Ocean Viromes (GOV), (iv) overcame issues of microdiversity in viral assemblies and (v) captured more genomic islands than short-read assemblies, providing insight into the gene content of whole genomic islands from metagenomic data. Thus, long-read viral metagenomics adds another tool to the maturing viral survey toolkit, recovering ubiquitous and abundant viral taxa missed by short-read sequencing.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

This facility incorporates a virtual space for a ?guest expert?. The aim of the study was to inform future development of courses at a time when computer conferencing was just becoming widespread in the university concerned. Quantitative data associated with the volume and patterns of individual participation in the computer conference were collected as well as interview material from students, tutors and the ?guest expert?. Findings from the study indicate that computer conferencing has the potential to facilitate the professional development of teachers as reflective practitioners and researchers. However, they also point to a number of barriers to student participation that must be addressed. These include access issues related to time constraints, unfamiliarity with the medium, and lack of confidence in expressing personal views in a public arena. A major conclusion drawn from this study is that it may be appropriate to consider future developments which incorporate the assumption that, in computer conferences of large professional development courses, students are much more likely to participate through reading rather than making personal contributions to conference discussions. This opens the possibility of reconceptualising the role of the ?guest expert? as two or more discussants with relevant expertise dialoguing with each other while students follow a threaded discussion and/or make personal contributions.},

Our ability to detect large-scale spatial variations in transfer efficiency is limited by the scarcity and uncertainties of particle flux data. Here we reconstruct deep ocean particle fluxes by diagnosing the rate of nutrient accumulation along transport pathways in a data-constrained ocean circulation model. Combined with estimates of organic matter export from the surface, these diagnosed fluxes reveal a global pattern of transfer efficiency to 1,000 m that is high (∼25\%) at high latitudes and low (∼5\%) in subtropical gyres, with intermediate values in the tropics. This pattern is well correlated with spatial variations in phytoplankton community structure and the export of ballast minerals, which control the size and density of sinking particles. These findings accentuate the importance of high-latitude oceans in sequestering carbon over long timescales, and highlight potential impacts on remineralization depth as phytoplankton communities respond to a warming climate.},

  abstract = {The remineralization depth of sinking organic particles controls the efficiency of the biological carbon pump by setting the sequestration timescale of remineralized carbon in the ocean interior. Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) have been identified as regions of elevated particle transfer and efficient carbon sequestration at depth, but direct measurements remain sparse in these regions and only provide snapshots of the particle flux. Here, we use remineralization tracers to reconstruct time-mean particle flux profiles in the OMZs of the Eastern Tropical Pacific and the Arabian Sea. Compared to the surrounding tropical waters, both OMZs exhibit slow flux attenuation between 100-1000m where suboxic waters reside, and sequester carbon beneath 1000m more than twice as efficiently. Using a mechanistic model of particle sinking, remineralization, and disaggregation, we show that three different mechanisms might explain the shape of the OMZ flux profiles: (i) a significant slow-down of remineralization when carbon oxidation transitions from aerobic to anaerobic respiration (e.g. denitrification); (ii) the exclusion of zooplankton that mediate disaggregation of large particles from suboxic waters (iii) the limitation of remineralization by the diffusive supply of oxidants (oxygen and nitrate) into large particles. We show that each mechanism leaves a unique signature in the size distribution of particles, suggesting that observations with optical instruments such as Underwater Vision Profilers hold great promise for understanding the drivers of efficient carbon transfer though suboxic water columns. In turn, this will allow more accurate prediction of future changes in carbon sequestration as the ocean loses oxygen in a warming climate.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) fixation by diazotrophic plankton is the primary source of this crucial nutrient to the ocean, but the factors limiting its rate and distribution are controversial. According to one view, the ecological niche of diazotrophs is primarily controlled by the ocean through internally generated N deficits that suppress the growth of their competitors. A second view posits an overriding limit from the atmosphere, which restricts diazotrophs to regions where dust deposition satisfies their high iron (Fe) requirement, thus separating N sources from sinks at a global scale. Here we use multiple geochemical signatures of N2 fixation to show that the Fe limitation of diazotrophs is strong enough to modulate the regional distribution of N2 fixation within ocean basins—particularly the Fe-poor Pacific—but not strong enough to influence its partition between basins, which is instead governed by rates of N loss. This scale-dependent limitation of N2 fixation reconciles local observations of Fe stress in diazotroph communities with an inferred spatial coupling of N sources and sinks. Within this regime of intermediate Fe control, the oceanic N reservoir would respond only weakly to enhanced dust fluxes during glacial climates, but strongly to the reduced fluxes hypothesized under anthropogenic climate warming.},

As such, biological iron apportionment has been described as one of the most ancient forms of microbial metabolism on Earth, and as a conceivable extraterrestrial metabolism on other iron-mineral-rich planets such as Mars. Furthermore, the metabolic versatility of the microorganisms involved in these reactions has resulted in the development of biotechnological applications to remediate contaminated environments and harvest energy.},

  abstract = {The average nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio of marine phytoplankton (16N:1P) is closely matched to the nutrient content of mean ocean waters (14.3N:1P). This condition is thought to arise from biological control over the ocean/'s nitrogen budget, in which removal of bioavailable nitrogen by denitrifying bacteria ensures widespread selection for diazotrophic phytoplankton that replenish this essential nutrient when it limits the growth of other species. Here we show that in the context of a realistic ocean circulation model, and a uniform N:P ratio of plankton biomass, this feedback mechanism yields an oceanic nitrate deficit more than double its observed value. The critical missing phenomenon is diversity in the metabolic N:P requirement of phytoplankton, which has recently been shown to exhibit large-scale patterns associated with species composition. When we model these variations, such that diazotrophs compete with high N:P communities in subtropical regions, the ocean nitrogen inventory rises and may even exceed the average N:P ratio of plankton. The latter condition, previously considered impossible, is prevented in the modern ocean by shallow circulations that communicate stoichiometric signals from remote biomes dominated by diatoms with low N:P ratios. Large-scale patterns of plankton diversity and the circulation pathways connecting them are thus key factors determining the availability of fixed nitrogen in the ocean.},

The processes through which this global relationship emerges despite the wide range of N/P ratios at the organism level are not known. Here we use an ocean circulation model and observed nutrient distributions to show that the N/P ratio of biological nutrient removal varies across latitude in Southern Ocean surface waters, from 12:1 in the polar ocean to 20:1 in the sub-Antarctic zone. These variations are governed by regional differences in the species composition of the plankton community. The covariation of dissolved nitrate and phosphate is maintained by ocean circulation, which mixes the shallow subsurface nutrients between distinct biogeographic provinces. Climate-driven shifts in these marine biomes may alter the mean N/P ratio and the associated carbon export by Southern Ocean ecosystems.},

The frequency of lysogenic cells (FLC) in bacterioplankton communities ranged from not detectable to 84\% as estimated by prophage induction due to mitomycin C, and highest values were typically found in deep waters (800–2,000 m). Transmission electron microscopy based estimates of virus-induced mortality of bacterioplankton (VMB) ranged from a few percent to 71\%, and highest values were found in anoxic waters of the Baltic Sea. FLC and the frequency of infected cells (FIC) were related in form of a negative power function indicating that environments exist where one of the two viral life strategies prevails. Across all investigated environments, FLC was negatively related to bacterial abundance and production, whereas FIC showed a positive relationship with viral and bacterial parameters. FIC was higher and FLC was lower in moderately productive estuarine and offshore surface waters than in less productive mesopelagic and deep waters. Thus, lysogeny seems to be a survival strategy at low host abundance and activity, whereas high host abundance and activity seems to favor the lytic life cycle. The key process for the prevalence of lytic infection compared to prophage replication at high host abundance could be competition due to outnumbering. Between 11\% and 88\% (average, 35\%) of the bacteria contained a functional (lytic or lysogenic) viral genome.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The mesopelagic (‘twilight’) zone of the ocean is the sandwich layer between euphotic surface waters and the deep ocean. The physical, chemical, and biological processes in this layer strongly influence the marine carbon cycle, although some surprising knowledge gaps remain, e.g. with respect to microbial communities. We therefore determined biological parameters such as microbial abundances, community respiration, and bacterial and archaeal community composition (as assessed by 16S rRNA gene PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, DGGE) over a seasonal time scale (at ca. 46 d intervals for 433 d) at a coastal mesopelagic site in the NW Mediterranean Sea (Point C, 300 m depth) and related them to physicochemical parameters. Some chemical and most biological parameters showed strong variability, thus confirming the emerging view that this water layer is more dynamic than previously thought. Community respiration was likely influenced by seasonal changes as indicated by its indirect relationship with water density. The high detected community respiration rates (0.23-1.65 µmol O2 l-1 d-1) confirm that the twilight zone plays a critical role as a hub between surface and deep water. Statistical analyses indicate that water stratification, dissolved organic carbon, and transparent exopolymeric particles were controlling factors of bacterial community composition, whereas the archaeal community was likely controlled by other mechanisms. A sequence analysis of DGGE bands and a literature comparison suggests some specificity of the mesopelagic zone regarding bacterial and archaeal community composition, thus further confirming the peculiarity of this water layer.},

A Landry-Hassett-type stepwise dilution experiment   conducted during a Synechococcus bloom in the Gulf of Mexico used both   (i) 0.2-mu m filtered seawater in which the abundance of bacteria and   grazers were reduced but the majority of viruses were retained, and (ii)   ultrafiltered (30 000 MW cutoff) virus-free seawater in which the   abundance of viruses, bacteria and grazers were reduced. High growth   rates and frequency of dividing cells (FDCs) were recorded in 0.2-mm   filtered treatments while growth was inhibited in incubations with a   high proportion of virus-free ultrafiltered water. In two subsequent   experiments using Mediterranean Sea populations, a two-point dilution   approach in which viral abundance was reduced by 80-90\% yielded similar   results, and showed that Synechococcus only grew well in the presence of   viruses, bacteria and grazers. In four further Mediterranean experiments   viruses removed via ultrafiltration were added back, either untreated,   or inactivated by a heat treatment. Growth rates and FDCs were higher in   the presence of untreated viruses than with viruses inactivated by heat,   suggesting that it was not organic matter in the virus-size fraction but   rather the presence of infectious viruses which sustained growth. While   Synechococcus was also infected by viruses during these experiments, our   data imply that growth of Synechococcus may depend upon viral lysis of   heterotrophic bacteria. This finding is consistent with the view that   nutrient cycling by viral lysis of heterotrophic bacteria may control   phytoplankton growth and ecosystem scale carbon production.},

Ribosomal RNA-targeted probes were employed as well as 16S RNA gene based PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to enumerate bacterial groups and assess bacterial community composition. We employed probes for Actinobacteria (HGC69a probe), Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroidetes bacteria (CF319a probe), BET42a probe (Betaproteobacteria) and a subgroup-Betaproteobacteria (R-BT065 probe). We found consumer-specific effects on bacterial activity and diversity (against a background of CF and BET dominating all treatments) suggesting distinct vulnerabilities to the two sources of mortality. For example, growth rate of Actinobacteria was only positive in the presence of flagellates, while towards the end of the experiment (T72−96~h) growth rate of R-BT was only positive in the viruses only treatment. More specific data on how viruses and flagellates influenced Flectobacillus are shown in the companion paper. Highest richness (number of DGGE bands) was found in the virus only treatment and lowest when both consumers were present. In addition, we found suggestions of both antagonistic and synergistic interactions between the two sources of bacterial mortality. Notably, bactivory by flagellates was associated with reductions in bacterial diversity and increases in viral production.},

  abstract = {Viral abundance and processes in the water column and sediments are well studied for some systems; however, we know relatively little about virus–host interactions on particles and how particles influence these interactions. Here we review virus–prokaryote interactions on inorganic and organic particles in the water column. Profiting from recent methodological progress, we show that confocal laser scanning microscopy in combination with lectin and nucleic acid staining is one of the most powerful methods to visualize the distribution of viruses and their hosts on particles such as organic aggregates. Viral abundance on suspended matter ranges from 105 to 1011 ml–1. The main factors controlling viral abundance are the quality, size and age of aggregates and the exposure time of viruses to aggregates. Other factors such as water residence time likely act indirectly. Overall, aggregates appear to play a role of viral scavengers or reservoirs rather than viral factories. Adsorption of viruses to organic aggregates or inorganic particles can stimulate growth of the free-living prokaryotic community, e.g. by reducing viral lysis. Such mechanisms can affect microbial diversity, food web structure and biogeochemical cycles. Viral lysis of bacterio- and phytoplankton influences the formation and fate of aggregates and can, for example, result in a higher stability of algal flocs. Thus, viruses also influence carbon export; however, it is still not clear whether they short-circuit or prime the biological pump. Throughout this review, emphasis has been placed on defining general problems and knowledge gaps in virus–particle interactions and on providing avenues for further research, particularly those linked to global change.},

  abstract = {The location and density of biologically useful energy sources on Mars will limit the biomass, spatial distribution, and organism size of any biota. Subsurface Martian organisms could be supplied with a large energy flux from the oxidation of photochemically produced atmospheric H2 and CO diffusing into the regolith. However, surface abundance measurements of these gases demonstrate that no more than a few percent of this available flux is actually being consumed, suggesting that biological activity driven by atmospheric H2 and CO is limited in the top few hundred meters of the subsurface. This is significant because the available but unused energy is extremely large: for organisms at 30-m depth, it is 2,000 times previous estimates of hydrothermal and chemical weathering energy and far exceeds the energy derivable from other atmospheric gases. This also implies that the apparent scarcity of life on Mars is not attributable to lack of energy. Instead, the availability of liquid water may be a more important factor limiting biological activity because the photochemical energy flux can only penetrate to 100- to 1,000-m depth, where most H2O is probably frozen. Because both atmospheric and Viking lander soil data provide little evidence for biological activity, the detection of short-lived trace gases will probably be a better indicator of any extant Martian life.},

We benchmark the performance of eight correlation techniques on simulated and real data in response to challenges specific to microbiome studies: fractional sampling of ribosomal RNA sequences, uneven sampling depths, rare microbes and a high proportion of zero counts. Also tested is the ability to distinguish signals from noise, and detect a range of ecological and time-series relationships.

  abstract = {Maximal growth rate is a basic parameter of microbial lifestyle that varies over several orders of magnitude, with doubling times ranging from a matter of minutes to multiple days. Growth rates are typically measured using laboratory culture experiments. Yet, we lack su cient understanding of the ecology and physiology of most microbes to design appropriate culture conditions for them, severely limiting our ability to assess the global diversity of microbial growth rates. Thus, genomic estimators of maximal growth rate provide a practical solution to survey the distribution of microbial growth potential, regardless of cultivation status. Here, we develop an improved maximal growth rate estimator, based on an expanded set of codon usage statistics, and implement this estimator in an easy-to-use R package (gRodon). We show gRodon outperforms the state-of-the-art growth estimator in multiple settings, including in a community context where we implement a novel species abundance correction for metagenomes. Additionally, we estimate maximal growth rates from over 200,000 genomes, metagenomeassembled genomes, and single-cell ampli ed genomes to survey growth potential across the range of prokaryotic diversity. We provide these compiled maximal growth rates in a publiclyavailable database (EGGO) and use this database to illustrate how culture collections show a strong bias towards organisms capable of rapid growth. We demonstrate how this database can be used to propagate maximal growth rate predictions to organisms for which we lack genomic information, on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence alone. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion and analysis of potential confounders, and observe a bias in genomic predictions of growth for extremely slow-growing organisms, ultimately leading us to suggest a novel evolutionary de nition of oligotrophy based on the selective regime an organism occupies.},

Recently, many novel CRISPR-associated proteins have been discovered via computational studies, but those studies relied on biased and incomplete databases of assembled genomes. We avoided these biases and applied a network theory approach to search for novel CRISPR-associated genes by leveraging subtle ecological cooccurrence patterns identified from environmental metagenomes. We validated our method using existing annotations and discovered 32 novel CRISPR-associated gene families. These genes span a range of putative functions, with many potentially regulating the response to infection. IMPORTANCE Every branch on the tree of life, including microbial life, faces the threat of viral pathogens. Over the course of billions of years of coevolution, prokaryotes have evolved a great diversity of strategies to defend against viral infections. One of these is the CRISPR adaptive immune system, which allows microbes to “remember” past infections in order to better fight them in the future. There has been much interest among molecular biologists in CRISPR immunity because this system can be repurposed as a tool for precise genome editing. Recently, a number of comparative genomics approaches have been used to detect novel CRISPR-associated genes in databases of genomes with great success, potentially leading to the development of new genome-editing tools. Here, we developed novel methods to search for these distinct classes of genes directly in environmental samples (“metagenomes”), thus capturing a more complete picture of the natural diversity of CRISPR-associated genes.},

  abstract = {Background Data from 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing present challenges to ecological and statistical interpretation. In particular, library sizes often vary over several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeros. Although we are typically interested in comparing relative abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not applicable. Here, we evaluate how these challenges impact the performance of existing normalization methods and differential abundance analyses. Results Effects on normalization: Most normalization methods enable successful clustering of samples according to biological origin when the groups differ substantially in their overall microbial composition. Rarefying more clearly clusters samples according to biological origin than other normalization techniques do for ordination metrics based on presence or absence. Alternate normalization measures are potentially vulnerable to artifacts due to library size., Effects on differential abundance testing: We build on a previous work to evaluate seven proposed statistical methods using rarefied as well as raw data. Our simulation studies suggest that the false discovery rates of many differential abundance-testing methods are not increased by rarefying itself, although of course rarefying results in a loss of sensitivity due to elimination of a portion of available data. For groups with large (\textasciitilde 10×) differences in the average library size, rarefying lowers the false discovery rate. DESeq2, without addition of a constant, increased sensitivity on smaller datasets ({$<$}20 samples per group) but tends towards a higher false discovery rate with more samples, very uneven (\textasciitilde 10×) library sizes, and/or compositional effects. For drawing inferences regarding taxon abundance in the ecosystem, analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) is not only very sensitive (for {$>$}20 samples per group) but also critically the only method tested that has a good control of false discovery rate. Conclusions These findings guide which normalization and differential abundance techniques to use based on the data characteristics of a given study.

  abstract = {Because of their fragile nature, marine snow-sized aggregates (aggregates {$>$}0.5 mm in longest dimension) have been generally overlooked in shallow-water environments. We report in situ observations and measurements in Cape Lookout Bight, North Carolina, that indicate that marine snow is probably always present and usually abundant. Underwater photographs show that over a period of hours, marine snow varies in size from 8 to 71 × 10−5 mL and in abundance from 291 to 489 L−1, but that such variations in size and abundance are not obviously related to tide, total suspended sediment concentration, or current speeds in the 10 to 20 cm s−1 range. Photographs and concurrent transmissometer records suggest that variations in size, shape, and abundance of marine snow may be sufficiently great that particulates do not remain optically constant and thus affect beam transmission, irrespective of total suspended-sediment concentration levels. Marine snow is significant geologically in that it has high settling rates (50 to 200 m per day) and may be the package in which much of the vertical mass flux occurs. If so, it offers an explanation for the high accumulation rates observed in coastal and estuarine fluid mud deposits.},

These bacteria are found in the feces of most wild and domestic animals and thus provide no information as to the source of fecal contamination, yet identification of indicator bacteria sources allows improved risk assessment, remediation, and total daily maximum load (TDML) assessment of environmental waters. This bacterial source tracking study was initiated in order to identify the dominant source(s) of fecal contamination in the urban watershed of Stevenson Creek in Clearwater, Florida. Five sites that represent areas where routine monitoring has previously shown high levels of fecal coliforms were sampled over 7 months. Fecal coliforms were enumerated by membrane filtration, and antibiotic resistance analysis was used to “fingerprint” a subset of randomly selected isolates and statistically match them to fingerprints of fecal coliforms from known sources (the library). A field test of the classification accuracy of the library was carried out by isolating fecal coliforms from the soil and waters surrounding a failing onsite wastewater treatment and disposal system (OSTDS). The vast majority of the isolates were classified into the human category. The major sources of fecal pollution in Stevenson Creek over the course of the study were wild animal, human, and, to a lesser extent, dog. Overall, wild animal feces were identified as the dominant source when fecal coliform levels were high, but when fecal coliform levels were low, the dominant source was identified as human. The results of this study demonstrate that the sources of fecal indicator bacteria within one urban watershed can vary substantially over temporal and spatial distances.},

Thus, the total amount of prokaryotic carbon is 60–100\% of the estimated total carbon in plants, and inclusion of prokaryotic carbon in global models will almost double estimates of the amount of carbon stored in living organisms. In addition, the earth’s prokaryotes contain 85–130 Pg of N and 9–14 Pg of P, or about 10-fold more of these nutrients than do plants, and represent the largest pool of these nutrients in living organisms. Most of the earth’s prokaryotes occur in the open ocean, in soil, and in oceanic and terrestrial subsurfaces, where the numbers of cells are 1.2 × 1029, 2.6 × 1029, 3.5 × 1030, and 0.25–2.5 × 1030, respectively. The numbers of heterotrophic prokaryotes in the upper 200 m of the open ocean, the ocean below 200 m, and soil are consistent with average turnover times of 6–25 days, 0.8 yr, and 2.5 yr, respectively. Although subject to a great deal of uncertainty, the estimate for the average turnover time of prokaryotes in the subsurface is on the order of 1–2 × 103 yr. The cellular production rate for all prokaryotes on earth is estimated at 1.7 × 1030 cells/yr and is highest in the open ocean.

Here, we examine N utilization above and within the ODZ of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific Ocean, focusing on distribution, uptake and genes for the utilization of two simple organic N compounds, urea and cyanate. Ammonium, urea and cyanate concentrations generally peaked in the oxycline while uptake rates were highest in the surface. Within the ODZ, concentrations were lower, but urea N and C and cyanate C were taken up. All identified autotrophs had an N assimilation pathway that did not require external ammonium: ODZ Prochlorococcus possessed genes to assimilate nitrate, nitrite and urea; nitrite oxidizers (Nitrospina) possessed genes to assimilate nitrite, urea and cyanate; anammox bacteria (Scalindua) possessed genes to utilize cyanate; and ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota possessed genes to utilize urea. Urease genes were present in 20\% of microbes, including SAR11, suggesting the urea utilization capacity was widespread. In the ODZ core, cyanate genes were largely (∼95\%) associated with Scalindua, suggesting that, within this ODZ, cyanate N is primarily used for N loss via anammox (cyanammox), and that anammox does not require ammonium for N loss.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton spring blooms in temperate and high-latitude shelf seas are commonly associated with an enhanced particulate organic carbon (POC) export of aggregates from the euphotic zone. In contrast, a postbloom situation is usually linked to a predominant POC retention, where small cells ({$<$}10 μm) and strong grazing pressure prevail. This study aimed to examine impacts of turbulence, phytoplankton, bloom stage, and zooplankton abundance on the sinking particles' size spectra and POC flux to improve the understanding of the downward flux mechanisms in the upper 100 m. We deployed sediment traps, partly modified with gel jars, at four depths along a stratification and phytoplankton bloom gradient in the Barents Sea, an Arctic shelf sea. The highest POC export (60 m: 923 mg C m−2 d−1) was found in deep-mixed, postbloom Atlantic influenced waters, despite the high grazer abundance (12,000 individuals m−3). Particle size spectra indicated that this flux was dominated by particles of 0.05–1.00 mm equivalent spherical diameter (ESDimage) with a POC:volume ratio matching copepod fecal pellets. Large particles (0.5–2.8 mm ESDimage) dominated the flux at a stratified, late peak bloom station in Arctic Waters and a stratified, late bloom situation at the Polar Front, but with lower POC:volume ratio and POC flux (60 m: {$<$}823 mg C m−2 d−1). Accordingly, a high POC flux at the base of the euphotic zone is not necessarily driven by large phytoplankton aggregates, but can also occur during a postbloom situation in form of small fecal pellet fragments with high POC content.},

  abstract = {The hyper-arid core of the Atacama Desert in Chile is considered the driest and most life-limited place on Earth, with few habitats capable of sustaining an active microbial ecosystem. As such, it is one of the best terrestrial analogues of the extreme arid conditions on Mars, and an ideal environment to explore survival and biological adaptation strategies as the environment becomes increasingly dry. Here we show that weakly welded rhyolitic ignimbrites in this desert are abundantly colonized by endolithic cyanobacteria and associated heterotrophic bacteria. We propose that the porous ignimbrite interior provides protection from damaging UV radiation and excessive levels of visible light. Rock porosity also favors cell hydration through water retention after scarce rainfall events, even when the surrounding environment remains stubbornly dry. This is the first known example of an endolithic microbial community colonizing ignimbrite rocks in an extremely dry environment. The existence of a habitat capable of supporting abundant phototrophic and heterotrophic communities in an environment that precludes most life forms suggests that, if similar deposits are found on Mars, these should be considered important targets in the search for life. Indeed, ignimbrite rocks have been tentatively identified in Gale Crater, the landing site of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission and could be directly analyzed by its rover Curiosity.},

  abstract = {It has recently been suggested that the majority of virus production in seawater is through lysogen induction, Here, we examine the mechanism of virus production in coastal surface seawater. Bacteria and viruses were removed from seawater by ultrafiltration (0.2 or 0.02 mu m) and introduced back to the water in 0.6 mu m filtered inocula. Viral and bacterial abundance was followed during sample incubations using transmission electron microscopy and acridine orange direct counts. Bacteria increased in abundance in all cases. When initial abundances were less than 1.3 x 10(6) viruses ml(-1), (with extremely low initial bacterial densities), viruses disappeared at a rate of 20 to 50\% d(-1) for the first 2 d and did not increase in abundance over the 7 d incubation period. Continuous sunlight exposure or a pulse of sunlight did not lead to detectable virus production, indicating that natural UV Light did not induce lysogens. In samples with initial abundances above 1.3 x 10(6) viruses ml(-1), significant increases as well as fluctuations in virus numbers were observed after the second day. This suggests that lytic infection, rather than the induction of lysogenic bacteria, is responsible for the majority of bacteriophage production in these experiments. Since lytic infection is dependent on encounter frequency, which is controlled by densities of both viruses and bacteria, the product of these 2 concentrations determines if infection may take place. We observed lytic infection only when the product of virus and bacteria numbers equalled 10(12) or more. Reported abundances of viruses and bacteria in natural seawater samples frequently fall above this level in surface waters and below it in mid and deep waters, suggesting that lytic infection map occur in all but deeper waters. However, due to the specificity of host/virus interactions, infection is also dependent on the quantitative bacterial species composition and diversity, which are presently unknown.},

Here we examine 25 samples covering all major water masses of the Southern Ocean to determine the effects of advection on microbial biogeography. Even when environmental factors and spatial separation are controlled for, there is a positive correlation between advection distance and taxonomic dissimilarity, indicating that an ‘advection effect’ has a role in shaping marine microbial community composition. This effect is likely due to the advection of cells increasing the probability that upstream microorganisms will colonize downstream sites. Our study shows that in addition to distance and environmental selection, advection shapes the composition of marine microbial communities.},

In Strain Engineering: Methods and Protocols, powerful new genetic engineering-based strain engineering methods are presented for rational modification of a variety of model organisms. These methods are particularly powerful when utilized to manipulate microbes for which sequenced and annotated genomes are available. Collectively, these methods systematically introduce genome alterations in a precise manner, allowing the creation of novel strains carrying only desired genome alterations. In the first section, E. coli-based bacterial strain engineering strategies are reviewed, while the second section presents analogous microbial engineering strategies for eukaryotic cells using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model. The third section covers examples of the proliferative adaptations of these base technologies to strain engineer industrially important prokaryotic or eukaryotic microbial systems. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters contain introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and notes on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and accessible, Strain Engineering: Methods and Protocols serves as an ideal guide to scientists in academia, pharmaceutical science, and biotechnology who perform microbial strain engineering.},

  abstract = {Diversity is a marker of ecosystem health in ecology, microbiology and immunology, with implications for disease diagnosis and infection resistance. However, accurately comparing diversity across environmental gradients is challenging, especially when number of different taxonomic groups in the community is large. Furthermore, existing approaches to estimating diversity do not perform well when the taxonomic groups in the community interact via an ecological network, such as by competing within their niche, or with mutualistic relationships. To address this, we propose DivNet, a method for estimating within- and between-community diversity in ecosystems where taxa interact via an ecological network. In particular, accounting for network structure permits more accurate estimates of alpha- and beta-diversity, even in settings with a large number of taxa and a small number of samples. DivNet is fast, accurate, precise, performs well with large numbers of taxa, and is robust to both weakly and strongly networked communities. We show that the advantages of incorporating taxon interactions into diversity estimation are especially clear in analyzing microbiomes and other high-diversity, strongly networked ecosystems. To illustrate the method, we analyze the microbiome of seafloor basalts based on a 16S amplicon sequencing dataset with 1490 taxa and 13 samples.},

This allows us to predict the unobserved count and hence estimate the total diversity. We believe that this is the first approach to depart from the classical mixed Poisson model in this problem. Our method is geometrically intuitive and yields good fits to data with reasonable standard errors. It is especially well-suited to analyzing high diversity datasets derived from next-generation sequencing in microbial ecology. We demonstrate the method's performance in this context and via simulation, and we present a dataset for which our method outperforms all competitors.},

We introduce a model for total (observed and unobserved) biodiversity that explicitly accounts for these rare taxa. Our method permits rigorous testing for both heterogeneity and biodiversity changes, and simultaneously improves type I and II error rates compared with existing methods. To estimate model parameters we utilize the well-developed literature of meta-analysis. The problem of substantial low abundance taxa missing from samples is especially pronounced in microbiomes, which are the focus of our case-studies.},

We present a species richness estimation tool which predicts both the number of unobserved taxa and the number of true singletons based on the non-singleton frequency counts. This method can be treated as either inferential (for formally estimating richness) or exploratory (for assessing robustness of the richness estimate to the singleton count). If the estimate, called breakaway\_nof1, is comparable to other richness estimators, this provides evidence that the richness estimate is robust to the level of quality control (eg. chimera-checking) employed in pre-processing.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Zooplankton play a key role in affecting the efficiency by which organic matter is exported to depth. Mesozooplankton consumption of detrital aggregates has been hypothesized as a mechanism for enhancing the export of picoplankton from surface layers. We analyzed the gut contents of mesopelagic copepods and ostracods using light and epifluorescence microscopy to determine if cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton too small to be ingested individually were present. Hind-guts were dissected from multiple species collected in discrete depth intervals between 0 and 1000 m during the day and night, at contrasting sites in the subtropical (Hawaii Ocean Time-series site ALOHA) and subarctic (Japanese time-series site K2) Pacific Ocean. Autofluorescing cyanobacteria and small eukaryotic phytoplankton were found in the guts of nearly all species sampled from all depths, indicating consumption of aggregates. Some of the cyanobacteria and other small cells ingested may have originated from inside the guts, or as symbionts, of microzooplankton, which were also common in the guts of many of these species. At both sites, most species’ guts contained higher concentrations of cyanobacteria and small phytoplankton at night than during the day. Ostracod guts at ALOHA contained higher densities of picoplankton than those at K2, reflecting the predominance of smaller cells at ALOHA. Guts of diel vertical migrators still contained picoplankton at their deep, daytime residence depths, indicating active export of these cells. Our results indicate mesozooplankton grazing on aggregates is a pathway by which flux of picoplankton can be enhanced.},

  abstract = {The average depth in the ocean at which the majority of sinking organic matter particles remineralise is a fundamental parameter in the ocean's role in regulating atmospheric CO2. Observed spatial patterns in sinking fluxes and relationships between the fluxes of different particles in the modern ocean have widely been used to invoke controlling mechanisms with important implications for CO2 regulation. However, such analyses are limited by the sparse spatial sampling of the available sediment trap data. Here we explore whether model ocean circulation rates, in the form of a transport matrix, can be used to derive remineralisation rates and infer sinking particle flux curves from the much more highly resolved observations of dissolved nutrient concentrations. Initially we show an example of the method using a transport matrix from the MITgcm model and demonstrate that there are a number of potential uncertainties associated with the method. We then use the Earth system model GENIE to generate a synthetic tracer data set to explore the method and its sensitivity to key sources of uncertainty arising from errors in the tracer observations and in the model circulation. We use a 54-member ensemble of different, but plausible, estimates of the modern circulation to explore errors associated with model transport rates. We find that reconstructed re-mineralisation rates are very sensitive to both errors in observations and model circulation rates, such that a simple inversion cannot provide a robust estimate of particulate flux profiles. Estimated remineralisation rates are particularly sensitive to differences between the "observed" and modelled circulation because remineralisation rates are 3–4 magnitudes smaller than transport rates. We highlight a potential method of constraining the uncertainty associated with using modelled circulation rates, although its success is limited by the observations currently available. Finally, we show that there are additional uncertainties when inferring particle flux curves from reliable estimates of remineralisation rates due to processes that are not restricted to the vertical water column transport, such as the cycling of dissolved organic matter.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of viral production in natural environments are critical for assessing the impacts of viral lysis on bacterial mortality and dissolved organic matter release. Here, viral production was estimated using a tangential flow diafiltration (TFD) dilution method, which reduced viral abundance to about 25\% of ambient while maintaining near ambient levels of bacterial abundance. In subsequent incubations, the rate of virus-like particle increase was measured and used to calculate viral production. TFD viral production estimates were compared to those from simultaneous incubations using a vacuum diafiltration procedure. At 4 stations in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays, viral production averaged 4.8 +/- 1.7 x 10(10) and 5.9 +/- 4.4 x 10(10) viruses l(-1) d(-1) as assessed by the TFD and vacuum methods, respectively. The TFD procedure improved upon the vacuum-based method by recovering significantly more of the bacterial community and requiring less sample processing time. Optimization tests of the TFD procedure found that a 0.22 mu m pore size filter with a flushing rate of 40 ml min(-1), and a flushing volume 4-fold the initial sample volume gave the best combination of bacterial recovery, viral dilution, and processing time. Based on TFD viral production estimates, viral lysis was responsible for the loss of 14 to 93\% of the bacterial standing stock and the release of 22 to 47 mu g C l(-1) d(-1) in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. These results indicate that viral lysis is a significant factor for microbial mortality and dissolved organic matter cycling within these estuaries.},

  abstract = {During cruises in the tropical Atlantic Ocean (January to February 2000) and the southern North Sea (December 2000), experiments were conducted to monitor the impact of virioplankton on archaeal and bacterial community richness. Prokaryotic cells equivalent to 10 to 100\% of the in situ abundance were inoculated into virus-free seawater, and viruses equivalent to 35 to 360\% of the in situ abundance were added. Batch cultures with microwave-inactivated viruses and without viruses served as controls. The apparent richness of archaeal and bacterial communities was determined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. Although the estimated richness of the prokaryotic communities generally was greatly reduced within the first 24 h of incubation due to confinement, the effects of virus amendment were detected at the level of individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the T-RFLP patterns of both groups, Archaea and Bacteria. One group of OTUs was detected in the control samples but was absent from the virus-treated samples. This negative response of OTUs to virus amendment probably was caused by viral lysis. Additionally, we found OTUs not responding to the amendments, and several OTUs exhibited variable responses to the addition of inactive or active viruses. Therefore, we conclude that individual members of pelagic archaeal and bacterial communities can be differently affected by the presence of virioplankton.},

  abstract = {Summary: A trade-off between strategies maximizing growth and minimizing losses appears to be a fundamental property of evolving biological entities existing in environments with limited resources. In the special case of unicellular planktonic organisms, the theoretical framework describing the trade-offs between competition and defense specialists is known as the “killing the winner” hypothesis (KtW). KtW describes how the availability of resources and the actions of predators (e.g., heterotrophic flagellates) and parasites (e.g., viruses) determine the composition and biogeochemical impact of such organisms. We extend KtW conceptually by introducing size- or shape-selective grazing of protozoans on prokaryotes into an idealized food web composed of prokaryotes, lytic viruses infecting prokaryotes, and protozoans. This results in a hierarchy analogous to a Russian doll, where KtW principles are at work on a lower level due to selective viral infection and on an upper level due to size- or shape-selective grazing by protozoans. Additionally, we critically discuss predictions and limitations of KtW in light of the recent literature, with particular focus on typically neglected aspects of KtW. Many aspects of KtW have been corroborated by in situ and experimental studies of isolates and natural communities. However, a thorough test of KtW is still hampered by current methodological limitations. In particular, the quantification of nutrient uptake rates of the competing prokaryotic populations and virus population-specific adsorption and decay rates appears to be the most daunting challenge for the years to come.},

  abstract = {Cohesive sediment, or mud, is encountered in most water bodies throughout the world. Often mud is a valuable resource, synonymous with fertile land, enriching the natural environment and used as an important building material. Yet mud also hinders navigation and consequently, dredging operations have been carried out since ancient times to safeguard navigation. Unfortunately, many mud deposits are now contaminated, endangering the eco-system and increasing the costs of dredging operations. The transport and fate of mud in the environment are still poorly understood and the need for basic research remains. This text contains the proceedings of the INTERCOH-2000 conference on progress in cohesive sediment research. It was the sixth in a series of conferences initially started by Professor Ashish Mehta in 1984 as a "Workshop on Cohesive Sediment Dynamics with Special Reference to the Processes in Estuaries". During these conferences the character of the first workshop has always been maintained, that is, small scale and dedicated to the physical and engineering aspects of cohesive sediments, without parallel sessions, but with ample time for discussions during and after the presentations, and followed by a book of proceedings containing thoroughly reviewed papers. INTERCOH-2000 was integrated with the final workshop of the COSINUS project. This project was carried out as a part of the European MAST-3 programme, and almost all European cohesive sediment workers were involved. INTERCOH-2000 focused on the behaviour and modelling of concentrated benthic suspensions, i.e. high-concentrated near-bed suspensions of cohesive sediment. Special attention was paid to: sediment - turbulence interaction; flocculation and settling velocity; high-concentrated mud suspensions; processes in the bed - consolidation; processes on the bed - erosion; field observations on mud dynamics; instrumentation; and numerical modelling.},

  abstract = {This paper presents new measurements on the settling velocity of mud flocs in the Lower Sea Scheldt, Belgium, and compares the results with data obtained previously in the Tamar estuary, UK. The data show that the flocs are fairly compact with a fractal dimension of about 2.2, which is indicative for reaction limited aggregation processes, characteristic in dynamic aquatic systems with large tidal flow velocities and high SPM (suspended particulate matter) concentrations. The data also reveal a fairly small dependency of the settling velocity from SPM concentrations, consistently much smaller than earlier data published in literature. Furthermore, a simple explicit formulation is proposed for the settling velocity of cohesive sediment in estuaries and coastal seas. It is derived from an analytical solution of a Lagrangean flocculation model, which accounts for turbulence-induced aggregation and floc break-up. Also the effects of variations in SPM and of a limited residence time of the flocs in the turbulent water column are included. The model has been calibrated against data from settling velocity measurements carried out in the Tamar estuary. Values of the measured settling velocity vary between 0.5 and 5mms−1 at SPM-values between 0.05 and 8gl−1. Using the tuned coefficients, the model describes the observations satisfactory, with an overall relative standard deviation of 30\%. Also, the well-known and observed increase in settling velocity with turbulent shear stress at low stresses and the opposite trend at high stresses is described properly. Next, the model is applied to the new data obtained in the Lower Sea Scheldt estuary, again comparing favourably with overall relative standard deviations of 30–50\%. It appeared that the coefficients of the model can be determined from independent measurements, but two of them have to be determined by trial and error, for which a simple procedure is proposed.},

Electron microscopy of negatively stained virions revealed icosahedral particles approximately 75 nm in diameter composed of a double capsid. Complete particles had buoyant densities in CsCl of 1.34 to 1.36 g/ml. The viruses replicated well in several fish cell lines, forming plaque-like syncytia in monolayer cultures. Each virus could be distinguished by the range of cell lines supporting its growth. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the genome of each virus was composed of 11 segments of dsRNA distributed among three size classes. There were three large, three medium and five small segments in each genome and each isolate had a unique electropherotype. The segments ranged from 2.5 × 106 to 0.31 × 106 mol. wt. with a total genome of approximately 15 × 106 mol. wt. Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed that each virus had five major structural proteins. There were two large polypeptides of approximately 135000 and 125000 mol. wt., one medium size polypeptide of 70000 mol. wt. and two small polypeptides of 45000 and 34000 mol. wt. Of the major structural proteins, those of approximately 70000 and 34000 mol. wt. were consistently present in the highest concentrations. Minor virion proteins were detected but were not characterized. These four viruses, isolated from aquatic animals, were unlike viruses of the six established genera of the Reoviridae.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Increasing deoxygenation (loss of oxygen) of the ocean, including expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), is a potentially important consequence of global warming. We examined present-day variability of vertical distributions of 23 calanoid copepod species in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) living in locations with different water column oxygen profiles and OMZ intensity (lowest oxygen concentration and its vertical extent in a profile). Copepods and hydrographic data were collected in vertically stratified day and night MOCNESS (Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System) tows (0–1000\,m) during four cruises over a decade (2007–2017) that sampled four ETNP locations: Costa Rica Dome, Tehuantepec Bowl, and two oceanic sites further north (21–22∘\,N) off Mexico. The sites had different vertical oxygen profiles: some with a shallow mixed layer, abrupt thermocline, and extensive very low oxygen OMZ core; and others with a more gradual vertical development of the OMZ (broad mixed layer and upper oxycline zone) and a less extensive OMZ core where oxygen was not as low. Calanoid copepod species (including examples from the genera Eucalanus, Pleuromamma, and Lucicutia) demonstrated different distributional strategies (implying different physiological characteristics) associated with this variability. We identified sets of species that (1)~changed their vertical distributions and depth of maximum abundance associated with the depth and intensity of the OMZ and its oxycline inflection points; (2)~shifted their depth of diapause; (3)~adjusted their diel vertical migration, especially the nighttime upper depth; or (4)~expanded or contracted their depth range within the mixed layer and upper part of the thermocline in association with the thickness of the aerobic epipelagic zone (habitat compression concept). These distribution depths changed by tens to hundreds of meters depending on the species, oxygen profile, and phenomenon. For example, at the lower oxycline, the depth of maximum abundance for Lucicutia hulsemannae shifted from ∼600 to ∼800\,m, and the depth of diapause for Eucalanus inermis shifted from ∼500 to ∼775\,m, in an expanded OMZ compared to a thinner OMZ, but remained at similar low oxygen levels in both situations. These species or life stages are examples of “hypoxiphilic” taxa. For the migrating copepod Pleuromamma abdominalis, its nighttime depth was shallow (∼20\,m) when the aerobic mixed layer was thin and the low-oxygen OMZ broad, but it was much deeper (∼100\,m) when the mixed layer and higher oxygen extended deeper; daytime depth in both situations was ∼300\,m. Because temperature decreased with depth, these distributional depth shifts had metabolic implications. The upper ocean to mesopelagic depth range encompasses a complex interwoven ecosystem characterized by intricate relationships among its inhabitants and their environment. It is a critically important zone for oceanic biogeochemical and export processes and hosts key food web components for commercial fisheries. Among the zooplankton, there will likely be winners and losers with increasing ocean deoxygenation as species cope with environmental change. Changes in individual copepod species abundances, vertical distributions, and life history strategies may create potential perturbations to these intricate food webs and processes. Present-day variability provides a window into future scenarios and potential effects of deoxygenation.},

While oxygen is known to be important in structuring midwater ecosystems, a precise and mechanistic understanding of the effects of oxygen on zooplankton is lacking. Zooplankton are important components of midwater food webs and biogeochemical cycles. Here, we show that, in the eastern tropical North Pacific OMZ, previously undescribed submesoscale oxygen variability has a direct effect on the distribution of many major zooplankton groups. Despite extraordinary hypoxia tolerance, many zooplankton live near their physiological limits and respond to slight (≤1\%) changes in oxygen. Ocean oxygen loss (deoxygenation) may, thus, elicit major unanticipated changes to midwater ecosystem structure and function.},

  abstract = {The distributions of pelagic and benthic fauna were examined in relation to the lower boundary of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) on and near Volcano 7, a seamount that penetrates this feature in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Although the broad, pronounced OMZ in this region is an effective barrier for most zooplankton, zooplankton abundances, zooplankton feeding rates, and ambient suspended particulate organic carbon (POC) peaked sharply in the lower OMZ (about 740--800 m), in association with the minimum oxygen concentration and the increasing oxygen levels just below it. Zooplankton in the lower OMZ were also larger in size, and the pelagic community included some very abundant, possibly opportunistic, species. Elevated POC and scatter in the light transmission data suggested the existence of a thin, particle-rich, and carbon-rich pelagic layer at the base of the OMZ. Gut contents of planktonic detritivores implied opportunistic ingestion of bacterial aggregates, possibly from this layer. Benthic megafaunal abundances on the seamount, which extended up to 730 m, peaked at about 800 m. There was a consistent vertical progression in the depth of first occurrence of different megafaunal taxa in this depth range, similar to intertidal zonation. Although the vertical gradients of temperature, salinity, and oxygen were gradual at the lower OMZ interface (in contrast to the upper OMZ interface at the thermocline), temporal variability in oxygen levels due to internal wave-induced vertical excursions of the OMZ may produce the distinct zonation in the benthic fauna. The characteristics of the lower OMZ interface result from biological interactions with the chemical and organic matter gradients of the OMZ. Most zooplankton are probably excluded physiologically from pronounced OMZs. The zooplankton abundance peak at the lower interface of the OMZ occurs where oxygen becomes sufficiently high to permit the zooplankton to utilize the high concentrations of organic particles that have descended through the OMZ relatively unaltered because of low metazoan abundance. A similar scenario applies to megabenthic distributions. Plankton layers and a potential short food chain (bacteria to zooplankton) at OMZ interfaces suggest intense utilization and modification of organic material, localized within a thin midwater depth zone. This could be a potentially significant filter for organic material sinking to the deep-sea floor.},

  abstract = {The anaerobic oxidation of ammonium (anammox) contributes significantly to the global loss of fixed nitrogen and is carried out by a deep branching monophyletic group of bacteria within the phylum Planctomycetes. Various studies have implicated anammox to be the most important process responsible for the nitrogen loss in the marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) with a low diversity of marine anammox bacteria. This comprehensive study investigated the anammox bacteria in the suboxic zone of the Black Sea and in three major OMZs (off Namibia, Peru and in the Arabian Sea). The diversity and population composition of anammox bacteria were investigated by both, the 16S rRNA gene sequences and the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS). Our results showed that the anammox bacterial sequences of the investigated samples were all closely related to the Candidatus Scalindua genus. However, a greater microdiversity of marine anammox bacteria than previously assumed was observed. Both phylogenetic markers supported the classification of all sequences in two distinct anammox bacterial phylotypes: Candidatus Scalindua clades 1 and 2. Scalindua 1 could be further divided into four distinct clusters, all comprised of sequences from either the Namibian or the Peruvian OMZ. Scalindua 2 consisted of sequences from the Arabian Sea and the Peruvian OMZ and included one previously published 16S rRNA gene sequence from Lake Tanganyika and one from South China Sea sediment (97.9–99.4\% sequence identity). This cluster showed only ≤ 97\% sequence identity to other known Candidatus Scalindua species. Based on 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequences we propose that the anammox bacteria of Scalindua clade 2 represent a novel anammox bacterial species, for which the name Candidatus Scalindua arabica is proposed. As sequences of this new cluster were found in the Arabian Sea, the Peruvian OMZ, in Lake Tanganyika and in South China sediment, we assume a global distribution of Candidatus Scalindua arabica as it is observed for Candidatus Scalindua sorokinii/brodae (or Scalindua clade 1).},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium by anammox bacteria plays an important role in catalyzing the loss of nitrogen from marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZ). However, in situ oxygen concentrations of up to 25 μM and ammonium concentrations close to or below the detection limit in the layer of anammox activity are hard to reconcile with the current knowledge of the physiology of anammox bacteria. We therefore investigated samples from the Namibian OMZ by comparative 16S rRNA gene analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Our results showed that “Candidatus Scalindua” spp., the typical marine anammox bacteria, colonized microscopic particles that were likely the remains of either macroscopic marine snow particles or resuspended particles. These particles were slightly but significantly (P {$<$} 0.01) enriched in Gammaproteobacteria (11.8\% ± 5.0\%) compared to the free-water phase (8.1\% ± 1.8\%). No preference for the attachment to particles could be observed for members of the Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, which were abundant (12 to 17\%) in both habitats. The alphaproteobacterial SAR11 clade, the Euryarchaeota, and group I Crenarchaeota, were all significantly depleted in particles compared to their presence in the free-water phase (16.5\% ± 3.5\% versus 2.6\% ± 1.7\%, 2.7\% ± 1.9\% versus {$<$}1\%, and 14.9\% ± 4.6\% versus 2.2\% ± 1.8\%, respectively, all P {$<$} 0.001). Sequence analysis of the crenarchaeotal 16S rRNA genes showed a 99\% sequence identity to the nitrifying “Nitrosopumilus maritimus.” Even though we could not observe conspicuous consortium-like structures of anammox bacteria with particle-enriched bacterioplankton groups, we hypothesize that members of Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes play a critical role in extending the anammox reaction to nutrient-depleted suboxic water layers in the Namibian upwelling system by creating anoxic, nutrient-enriched microniches.},

  abstract = {Molecular structures and sequences are generally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progressively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molecular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more profound nature than the differences that separate typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships among living systems--i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy--reflects this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called a "domain." Life on this planet would then be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more kingdoms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined). Although taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely thermophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea.},

  abstract = {Microbial source tracking (MST) tools are used to identify sources of fecal pollution for accurately assessing public health risk and implementing best management practices (BMPs). This review focuses on the potential of enteric viruses for MST applications. Following host infection, enteric viruses replicate and are excreted in high numbers in the hosts' feces and urine. Due to the specificity in host infection, enteric viruses have been considered one of the most accurate library-independent culture-independent MST tools. In an assessment of molecular viral assays based on sensitivity, specificity and the density of the target virus in fecal-impacted samples, human adenovirus and human polyomavirus were found to be the most promising human-specific viral markers. However, more research is needed to identify promising viral markers for livestock because of cross-reactions that were observed among livestock species or the limited number of samples tested for specificity. Other viral indicators of fecal origin, F+ RNA coliphage and pepper mild mottle virus, have also been proposed as potential targets for developing MST markers. Enhancing the utility of enteric viruses for MST applications through next generation sequencing (NGS) and virus concentration technology is discussed in the latter part of this review. The massive sequence databases generated by shotgun and gene-targeted metagenomics enable more efficient and reliable design of MST assays. Finally, recent studies revealed that alternative virus concentration methodologies may be more cost-effective than standard technologies such as 1MDS; however, improvements in the recovery efficiency and consistency are still needed. Overall, developments in metagenomic information combined with efficient concentration methodologies, as well as high host-specificity, make enteric viruses a promising tool in MST applications.},

At the first (micro) level, the usual logistic regression model is defined for each context. The same regressors are used in each context, but the micro regression coefficients are free to vary over contexts. At the second level, the micro coefficients are treated as functions of macro regressors. An empirical Bayes estimation procedure is proposed for estimating the micro and macro coefficients. Explicit formulas are provided that are computationally feasible for large-scale data analyses; these include an algorithm for finding the maximum likelihood estimates of the covariance components representing within- and between-macro-equation error variability.

We analyzed seasonal variation in the MC content of primary and secondary consumers, and used dietary analysis (gut contents and stable isotopes) to improve understanding of cyanotoxin transport in food webs. Periods of elevated toxin concentration were associated with peaks in the abundance of genes specific to Microcystis and MC toxin production (mcyD). Peak toxin levels in consumer tissues coincided with peak MC concentrations in seston. However, toxins in tissues persisted in overwintering populations suggesting that potential health impacts may not be limited to bloom periods. Interspecific differences in tissue MC concentrations were related to feeding habits and organic matter sources as pelagic fishes ingested a greater proportion of algae in their diet, which resulted in greater MC content in liver and muscle tissues. Sediments contained a greater proportion of allochthonous (terrestrial) organic matter and lower concentrations of MC, resulting in lower toxin concentrations among benthic detritivores. Among shellfish, the benthic suspension feeder Rangia cuneata (wedge clam) showed seasonal avoidance of toxin ingestion due to low feeding rates during periods of elevated MC. Among predators, adult Blue Catfish had low MC concentrations, whereas Blue Crabs exhibited high levels of MC in both muscle and viscera.},

  abstract = {Summary.\hspace{0.6em} Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton–Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

  abstract = {Representation of generalized additive models (GAM's) using penalized regression splines allows GAM's to be employed in a straightforward manner using penalized regression methods. Not only is inference facilitated by this approach, but it is also possible to integrate model selection in the form of smoothing parameter selection into model fitting in a computationally efficient manner using well founded criteria such as generalized cross-validation. The current fitting and smoothing parameter selection methods for such models are usually effective, but do not provide the level of numerical stability to which users of linear regression packages, for example, are accustomed. In particular the existing methods cannot deal adequately with numerical rank deficiency of the GAM fitting problem, and it is not straightforward to produce methods that can do so, given that the degree of rank deficiency can be smoothing parameter dependent. In addition, models with the potential flexibility of GAM's can also present practical fitting difficulties as a result of indeterminacy in the model likelihood: Data with many zeros fitted by a model with a log link are a good example. In this article it is proposed that GAM's with a ridge penalty provide a practical solution in such circumstances, and a multiple smoothing parameter selection method suitable for use in the presence of such a penalty is developed. The method is based on the pivoted QR decomposition and the singular value decomposition, so that with or without a ridge penalty it has good error propagation properties and is capable of detecting and coping elegantly with numerical rank deficiency. The method also allows mixtures of user specified and estimated smoothing parameters and the setting of lower bounds on smoothing parameters. In terms of computational efficiency, the method compares well with existing methods. A simulation study compares the method to existing methods, including treating GAM's as mixed models.},

Although their functional roles remain elusive, MGA subgroups are particularly abundant and diverse in oxygen minimum zones and permanent or seasonally stratified anoxic basins, suggesting metabolic adaptation to oxygen-deficiency. Here, we expand a previous survey of MGA diversity in O2-deficient waters of the Northeast subarctic Pacific Ocean (NESAP) to include Saanich Inlet (SI), an anoxic fjord with seasonal O2 gradients and periodic sulfide accumulation. Phylogenetic analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene clone libraries recovered five previously described MGA subgroups and defined three novel subgroups (SHBH1141, SHBH391, and SHAN400) in SI. To discern the functional properties of MGA residing along gradients of O2 in the NESAP and SI, we identified and sequenced to completion 14 fosmids harboring MGA-associated 16S RNA genes from a collection of 46 fosmid libraries sourced from NESAP and SI waters. Comparative analysis of these fosmids, in addition to four publicly available MGA-associated large-insert DNA fragments from Hawaii Ocean Time-series and Monterey Bay, revealed widespread genomic differentiation proximal to the ribosomal RNA operon that did not consistently reflect subgroup partitioning patterns observed in 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. Predicted protein-coding genes associated with adaptation to O2-deficiency and sulfur-based energy metabolism were detected on multiple fosmids, including polysulfide reductase (psrABC), implicated in dissimilatory polysulfide reduction to hydrogen sulfide and dissimilatory sulfur oxidation. These results posit a potential role for specific MGA subgroups in the marine sulfur cycle.},

This clone library of nearly full-length amplicons of bacterial 16S rRNA genes has been the subject of previous studies aimed at identifying bacteria that inhibit the lower ocean surface layer. The novel lineage was identified by randomly sequencing clones that did not hybridize to oligonucleotide probes specific for several abundant bacterioplankton groups identified in previous studies. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that SAR324 was most closely affiliated with the DP, although it showed no specific relationship to any DP 16S rRNA genes in databases. Eight of the clones in the library of 148 clones were identified as members of the SAR324 lineage by hybridization to an oligonucleotide probe specific for SAR324. Subsequent hybridizations showed that the SAR324 group is stratified in the lower surface layer of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with maxima between 160 and 500 m. The repeated discovery of sequences belonging to different gene clusters with similar distributions in this region of the water column suggests that microbial communities in the lower surface layer may be functionally specialized.},

  abstract = {Short-term hydrodynamic fluctuations caused by extreme weather events are expected to increase worldwide because of global climate change, and such fluctuations can strongly influence cyanobacterial blooms. In this study, the cyanobacterial bloom disappearance and reappearance in Lake Taihu, China, in response to short-term hydrodynamic fluctuations, was investigated by field sampling, long-term ecological records, high-frequency sensors and MODIS satellite images. The horizontal drift caused by the dominant easterly wind during the phytoplankton growth season was mainly responsible for cyanobacterial biomass accumulation in the western and northern regions of the lake and subsequent bloom formation over relatively long time scales. The cyanobacterial bloom changed slowly under calm or gentle wind conditions. In contrast, the short-term bloom events within a day were mainly caused by entrainment and disentrainment of cyanobacterial colonies by wind-induced hydrodynamics. Observation of a westerly event in Lake Taihu revealed that when the 30~min mean wind speed (flow speed) exceeded the threshold value of 6~m/s (5.7~cm/s), cyanobacteria in colonies were entrained by the wind-induced hydrodynamics. Subsequently, the vertical migration of cyanobacterial colonies was controlled by hydrodynamics, resulting in thorough mixing of algal biomass throughout the water depth and the eventual disappearance of surface blooms. Moreover, the intense mixing can also increase the chance for forming larger and more cyanobacterial colonies, namely, aggregation. Subsequently, when the hydrodynamics became weak, the cyanobacterial colonies continuously float upward without effective buoyancy regulation, and cause cyanobacterial bloom explosive expansion after the westerly. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that the strong wind happening frequently during April and October can be an important cause of the formation and expansion of cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu.},

  abstract = {Current estimates of COVID-19 prevalence are largely based on symptomatic, clinically diagnosed cases. The existence of a large number of undiagnosed infections hampers population-wide investigation of viral circulation. Here, we use longitudinal wastewater analysis to track SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in wastewater at a major urban wastewater treatment facility in Massachusetts, between early January and May 2020. SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in wastewater on March 3. Viral titers in wastewater increased exponentially from mid-March to mid-April, after which they began to decline. Viral titers in wastewater correlated with clinically diagnosed new COVID-19 cases, with the trends appearing 4-10 days earlier in wastewater than in clinical data. We inferred viral shedding dynamics by modeling wastewater viral titers as a convolution of back-dated new clinical cases with the viral shedding function of an individual. The inferred viral shedding function showed an early peak, likely before symptom onset and clinical diagnosis, consistent with emerging clinical and experimental evidence. Finally, we found that wastewater viral titers at the neighborhood level correlate better with demographic variables than with population size. This work suggests that longitudinal wastewater analysis can be used to identify trends in disease transmission in advance of clinical case reporting, and may shed light on infection characteristics that are difficult to capture in clinical investigations, such as early viral shedding dynamics.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimation of microbial community composition based on metagenomic sequencing data is fundamental for subsequent metagenomics analysis. Prevalent estimation methods are mainly based on directly summarizing alignment results or its variants; often result in biased and/or unstable estimates. We have developed a unified probabilistic framework (named GRAMMy) by explicitly modeling read assignment ambiguities, genome size biases and read distributions along the genomes. Maximum likelihood method is employed to compute Genome Relative Abundance of microbial communities using the Mixture Model theory (GRAMMy). GRAMMy has been demonstrated to give estimates that are accurate and robust across both simulated and real read benchmark datasets. We applied GRAMMy to a collection of 34 metagenomic read sets from four metagenomics projects and identified 99 frequent species (minimally 0.5\% abundant in at least 50\% of the data- sets) in the human gut samples. Our results show substantial improvements over previous studies, such as adjusting the over-estimated abundance for  Bacteroides  species for human gut samples, by providing a new reference-based strategy for metagenomic sample comparisons. GRAMMy can be used flexibly with many read assignment tools (mapping, alignment or composition-based) even with low-sensitivity mapping results from huge short-read datasets. It will be increasingly useful as an accurate and robust tool for abundance estimation with the growing size of read sets and the expanding database of reference genomes.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Local similarity analysis of biological time series data helps elucidate the varying dynamics of biological systems. However, its applications to large scale high-throughput data are limited by slow permutation procedures for statistical significance evaluation. RESULTS: We developed a theoretical approach to approximate the statistical significance of local similarity analysis based on the approximate tail distribution of the maximum partial sum of independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. Simulations show that the derived formula approximates the tail distribution reasonably well (starting at time points {$>$} 10 with no delay and {$>$} 20 with delay) and provides P-values comparable with those from permutations. The new approach enables efficient calculation of statistical significance for pairwise local similarity analysis, making possible all-to-all local association studies otherwise prohibitive. As a demonstration, local similarity analysis of human microbiome time series shows that core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are highly synergetic and some of the associations are body-site specific across samples. AVAILABILITY: The new approach is implemented in our eLSA package, which now provides pipelines for faster local similarity analysis of time series data. The tool is freely available from eLSA's website: http://meta.usc.edu/softs/lsa. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. CONTACT: fsun@usc.edu.},

The data revealed spatial heterogeneity in microbial populations in the offshore and near-shore waters of the NYS during the summer. For the surface layer, picoeukaryotes were abundant in the near-shore waters, Synechococcus was abundant in the offshore areas, and bacterial and viral abundances were high in the near-shore waters around the Liaodong peninsula. In the near-shore waters, no significant vertical variation of picophytoplankton (0.2-2 mu m) abundance was found. However, the nanophytoplankton abundance was higher in the upper layers (from the surface to 10 m depth) than in the bottom layer. For the offshore waters, both pico- and nanophytoplankton (2-20 mu m) abundance decreased sharply with depth in the North Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass (NYSCWM). But, for the vertical distribution of virus and bacteria abundance, no significant variation was observed in both near-shore and offshore waters. Autotrophic microbes were more sensitive to environmental change than heterotrophic microbes and viruses. Viruses showed a positive correlation with bacterial abundance, suggesting that the bacteriophage might be prominent for virioplankton (about 0.45 mu m) in summer in the NYS and that viral abundance might play an important role in microbial loop functions.},

In this paper, we introduce a Chesapeake Bay community implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ChesROMS) and use it to investigate the interannual variability of salinity in Chesapeake Bay. The ChesROMS implementation was evaluated by quantitatively comparing the model solutions with the observed variations in the Bay for a 15-year period (1991 to 2005). Temperature fields were most consistently well predicted, with a correlation of 0.99 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.5°C for the period, with modeled salinity following closely with a correlation of 0.94 and RMSE of 2.5. Variability of salinity anomalies from climatology based on modeled salinity was examined using empirical orthogonal function analysis, which indicates the salinity distribution in the Bay is principally driven by river forcing. Wind forcing and tidal mixing were also important factors in determining the salinity stratification in the water column, especially during low flow conditions. The fairly strong correlation between river discharge anomaly in this region and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation suggests that the long-term salinity variability in the Bay is affected by large-scale climate patterns. The detailed analyses of the role and importance of different forcing, including river runoff, atmospheric fluxes, and open ocean boundary conditions, are discussed in the context of the observed and modeled interannual variability.},

This new method was applied to data from MedFlux, as well as from the US JGOFS NABE, EqPac, and ASPS studies. Fluxes of mass and of four chemical tracers, as well as the molar ratios of the latter, were plotted on logarithmic scales; Fourier series were then fit to these data. In each case we determined the most likely settling velocity using a likelihood-based nonlinear fitting algorithm. Variation among estimates using single tracers was significantly less than variation using tracer ratios; we therefore concluded that estimates based on single tracers are to be preferred to estimates based on tracer ratios. Our results also showed no obvious differences among SVs estimated using different single tracers. The best estimate of settling velocity using single-tracer fluxes with good temporal resolution (i.e. for sites with cup rotation times ⩽8.5 days) is 205 m/d, with standard deviation 74 m/d. For MedFlux data alone (which have a resolution of 4–6 days), the estimate is 220±65 m/d. This latter value is within 10\% of the estimate of average settling velocity (242±31 m/d) made using MedFlux IRS traps in “settling velocity” mode.},

We investigated whether marine bacteria enhance the coagulation of gel particles. Gel particles composed of polysaccharides with an equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) of 0.01 cm were suspended in seawater contained in rotating tubes to examine time course changes in particle ESD and abundance. Marine bacterial assemblages strongly enhanced the coagulation of gel particles into large aggregates (ESD, 0.1 to 1 cm) over a period of 24 to 96 h. Catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that one group of bacteria that grew rapidly was affiliated with the genus Pseudoalteromonas. Experiments using Pseudoalteromonas spp. isolates indicated that 6 of 11 isolates enhanced gel particle coagulation. This enhancement differed greatly by species. High settling velocities, up to 270 m d−1, were determined for the large aggregates. Our results demonstrate that bacteria can substantially enhance gel particle coagulation and the formation of fast-settling large aggregates in seawater.},

Chlorophyll a concentrations in the euphotic layer were similar (range: 0.1−1 µg l−1) in these 2 regions. TEP concentrations were 1.3−5.4 times higher (depending on depth) in the Arctic Ocean than in the Pacific Ocean. In the Arctic Ocean, TEP concentrations decreased with depth and were positively correlated with particulate organic carbon (POC) and prokaryotic parameters (abundance and production). In contrast, in the Pacific Ocean, TEP were distributed uniformly with depth and were uncoupled from POC and prokaryotic parameters. The estimated amount of carbon associated with TEP (TEP-C) exceeded that of POC in the mesopelagic layer of both regions (the TEPC concentrations were 2−3 times higher than the concentrations of POC) and in the bathypelagic layer of the Pacific Ocean (the TEP-C concentrations were 6 times higher than the concentrations of POC). Our results suggest that TEP are a dynamic and large component of the organic carbon pool in the ocean interior, influenced by vertical transport, in situ prokaryotic production, and the self-assembly of polymeric precursors.},

  abstract = {Viruses influence microbial community structure and biogeochemical cycles in marine environments. Viral attachment to nonhost surfaces could influence host viral infection rates; however, the prevalence of such viral attachment is not investigated quantitatively. We used coastal seawater viral assemblages and, as models, marine vibriophage (SIO-2) and enterobacteriophages (T2 and T4) to investigate their attachment to probable nonhost marine bacteria. We also studied viral attachment to colloids and other abiotic surfaces in seawater. Centrifugation experiments with bacterium-virus mixtures showed substantial viral loss in the supernatant presumably due to the viral attachment to bacteria. This attachment (0.04 to 24 viruses ␮mϪ2 [bacterial surface area]) varied with bacterium-virus combinations. Surprisingly, filtering seawater on 0.2-␮m Anodisc or polycarbonate filters retained ϳ12 to 84\% of viruses presumably attached to Ն0.2-␮m-sized particles and/or the filter surface. Enzymatic digestion followed by epifluorescence and atomic force microscopy suggested that 7 to 25\% of the total viruses were attached via ␤-glycosidic linkages. Furthermore, a substantial proportion (7 to 48\%) of viruses became attached to model abiotic surfaces (polycarbonate, polypropylene, and glass), and this has significance for laboratory protocols as well as studies of virus ecology in particle-rich marine environments. Substantial attachment of viruses to nonhost surfaces could influence virus-driven biogeochemical cycles and microbial community structure.},

The difference in concentration of tracers between the surface and the deep water depends not only on the export production but also on the remineralization depth. Case studies changing the vertical profile of particulate organic matter (POM) flux and the export production show that the phosphate distribution can be reproduced only when the vertical profile of POM flux observed by sediment traps is used. The export production consistent with the observed distribution of phosphate is estimated to be about 10 GtC/yr. Case studies changing the vertical profile of calcite flux and the rain ratio, a ratio of production rate of calcite against that of particulate organic carbon (POC), show that the rain ratio should be smaller than the widely used value of 0.25. The rain ratio consistent with the observed distribution of alkalinity is estimated to be 0.08 to approximately 0.10. This value can be easily understood in a two-box model where the difference of remineralization depth between POC and calcite is taken into account.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton blooms are a worldwide ecological problem and one of the major algae that cause phytoplankton blooms is Akashiwo sanguinea. Though much research has addressed the abiotic causes (e.g. growth condition) of A. sanguinea blooms, few studies have examined the dynamics of microbial communities associated with these blooms. In this study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16S rDNA genes was used to document changes in the phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities associated with an A. sanguinea bloom that occurred in the Xiamen sea in May 2010. Surface sea water was sampled once a day within five consecutive days at four sites, and the microbial community composition was determined using DGGE. Sea water concentrations of chlorophyll a, nitrate and phosphate were also measured. The results indicated that the A. sanguinea bloom was probably stimulated by low salinity (26–30‰) and ended probably because inorganic nutrients were consumed and resulted in a N/P ratio unfavorable for this alga. Gammaproteobacteria populations increased significantly during bloom declines and then decreased post-bloom. Divergences in the microbial community composition during different bloom periods were the result of changes in Candidatus, Pelagibacter, Alteromonas, Rhodobacteraceae, Vibrio and Pseudoalteromonas populations. Sediminimonas qiaohouensis was the first bacterium shown to be significantly negatively correlated with A. sanguinea concentration. This study indicated that bacteria may play an important role in A. sanguinea–bloom regulation and provides a deeper insight into bacterial community succession during and after an A. sanguinea–bloom.},

  abstract = {Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) echoes can be transformed into mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS), which is positively proportional to the biomass of zooplankton and micronekton. A mooring with an upward-looking 75-kHz ADCP was deployed on the northern slope of the South China Sea to monitor diel vertical migration (DVM) and vertical distributions of zooplankton and micronekton under general conditions and extreme conditions such as typhoons. DVM occurs throughout the year, with the maximum migrating speed reaching 9.0 cm s−1. It had some cyclic variation, which was in response to marine environment and astronomical influence. Light initiates the ascents and descents of the migrators, and migration intensity may be proportional to the solar altitude. Neap-spring tidal cycle and full moon phase influences are prominent, and the peak at 112 d may be driven by variation of currents. In addition, 270 m is the demarcation between upward and downward migrations; some organisms living below this layer, especially zooplankton and micronekton, migrate to the surface to obtain nutrients and energy; other marine mesopelagic organisms also survive in this manner. Super and severe typhoons reduced vertical migration, having less influence on the deep scattering layer. As Super Typhoon Rammasun passed by the mooring station, current speed increases and temperature decreases were synchronous with changes in the deep scattering layer; the migrators swam downward to evade the influence of a higher-speed current rather than swam upward to compensate for the decrease of temperature.},

  abstract = {Although competition–dispersal tradeoffs are commonly invoked to explain species coexistence for animals and plants in spatially structured environments, such mechanisms for coexistence remain unknown for microorganisms. Here we show that two recently speciated marine bacterioplankton populations pursue different behavioral strategies to exploit nutrient particles in adaptation to the landscape of ephemeral nutrient patches characteristic of ocean water. These differences are mediated primarily by differential colonization of and dispersal among particles. Whereas one population is specialized to colonize particles by attaching and growing biofilms, the other is specialized to disperse among particles by rapidly detecting and swimming toward new particles, implying that it can better exploit short-lived patches. Because the two populations are very similar in their genomic composition, metabolic abilities, chemotactic sensitivity, and swimming speed, this fine-scale behavioral adaptation may have been responsible for the onset of the ecological differentiation between them. These results demonstrate that the principles of spatial ecology, traditionally applied at macroscales, can be extended to the ocean’s microscale to understand how the rich spatiotemporal structure of the resource landscape contributes to the fine-scale ecological differentiation and species coexistence among marine bacteria.},

  abstract = {It is well known that current equilibrium-based models fall short as predictive descriptions of natural ecosystems, and particularly of fisheries systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. For example, model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time, models may fit well to existing data but lack out-of-sample predictive skill, and key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems. With these frailties, it is somewhat surprising that static equilibrium models continue to be widely used. Here, we examine empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an alternative to imposed model equations and that accommodates both nonequilibrium dynamics and nonlinearity. Using time series from nine stocks of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada, we perform, for the the first time to our knowledge, real-data comparison of contemporary fisheries models with equivalent EDM formulations that explicitly use spawning stock and environmental variables to forecast recruitment. We find that EDM models produce more accurate and precise forecasts, and unlike extensions of the classic Ricker spawner–recruit equation, they show significant improvements when environmental factors are included. Our analysis demonstrates the strategic utility of EDM for incorporating environmental influences into fisheries forecasts and, more generally, for providing insight into how environmental factors can operate in forecast models, thus paving the way for equation-free mechanistic forecasting to be applied in management contexts.},

  abstract = {Mock communities have been used in microbiome method development to help estimate biases introduced in PCR amplification and sequencing and to optimize pipeline outputs. Nevertheless, the strong value of routine mock community analysis beyond initial method development is rarely, if ever, considered. Here we report that our routine use of mock communities as internal standards allowed us to discover highly aberrant and strong biases in the relative proportions of multiple taxa in a single Illumina HiSeqPE250 run. In this run, an important archaeal taxon virtually disappeared from all samples, and other mock community taxa showed {$>$}2-fold high or low abundance, whereas a rerun of those identical amplicons (from the same reaction tubes) on a different date yielded “normal” results. Although obvious from the strange mock community results, we could have easily missed the problem had we not used the mock communities because of natural variation of microbiomes at our site. The “normal” results were validated over four MiSeqPE300 runs and three HiSeqPE250 runs, and run-to-run variation was usually low. While validating these “normal” results, we also discovered that some mock microbial taxa had relatively modest, but consistent, differences between sequencing platforms. We strongly advise the use of mock communities in every sequencing run to distinguish potentially serious aberrations from natural variations. The mock communities should have more than just a few members and ideally at least partly represent the samples being analyzed to detect problems that show up only in some taxa and also to help validate clustering. IMPORTANCE Despite the routine use of standards and blanks in virtually all chemical or physical assays and most biological studies (a kind of “control”), microbiome analysis has traditionally lacked such standards. Here we show that unexpected problems of unknown origin can occur in such sequencing runs and yield completely incorrect results that would not necessarily be detected without the use of standards. Assuming that the microbiome sequencing analysis works properly every time risks serious errors that can be detected by the use of mock communities.},

  abstract = {In order to characterize how disturbances to microbial communities are propagated over temporal and spatial scales in aquatic environments, the dynamics of bacterial assemblages throughout a subtropical coastal embayment were investigated via SSU rRNA gene analyses over an 8-month period, which encompassed a large storm event. During non-perturbed conditions, sampling sites clustered into three groups based on their microbial community composition: an offshore oceanic group, a freshwater group, and a distinct and persistent coastal group. Significant differences in measured environmental parameters or in the bacterial community due to the storm event were found only within the coastal cluster of sampling sites, and only at 5 of 12 locations; three of these sites showed a significant response in both environmental and bacterial community characteristics. These responses were most pronounced at sites close to the shoreline. During the storm event, otherwise common bacterioplankton community members such as marine Synechococcus sp. and members of the SAR11 clade of Alphaproteobacteria decreased in relative abundance in the affected coastal zone, whereas several lineages of Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and members of the Roseobacter clade of Alphaproteobacteria increased. The complex spatial patterns in both environmental conditions and microbial community structure related to freshwater runoff and wind convection during the perturbation event leads us to conclude that spatial heterogeneity was an important factor influencing both the dynamics and the resistance of the bacterioplankton communities to disturbances throughout this complex subtropical coastal system. This heterogeneity may play a role in facilitating a rapid rebound of regions harboring distinctly coastal bacterioplankton communities to their pre-disturbed taxonomic composition.},

Thus, more and smaller plastics particles, termed microplastics, reside in the environment and are now a contaminant category of concern. The current study tested the hypotheses that microplastics concentration would be higher in proximity to urban sources, and vary temporally in response to weather phenomena such as storm events. Triplicate surface water samples were collected approximately monthly between July and December 2011 from four estuarine tributaries within the Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A. using a manta net to capture appropriately sized microplastics (operationally defined as 0.3–5.0 mm). Selected sites have watersheds with broadly divergent land use characteristics (e.g., proportion urban/suburban, agricultural and/or forested) and wide ranging population densities.

Environmental variability can also cause clustering: for example, marine turbulence transports plankton2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and produces chlorophyll concentration patterns in the upper ocean9,10,11. Even in a homogeneous environment, nonlinear interactions between species12,13,14 can result in spontaneous pattern formation. Here we show that a population of independent, random-walking organisms (‘brownian bugs’), reproducing by binary division and dying at constant rates, spontaneously aggregates. Using an individual-based model, we show that clusters form out of spatially homogeneous initial conditions without environmental variability, predator–prey interactions, kinesis or taxis. The clustering mechanism is reproductively driven—birth must always be adjacent to a living organism. This clustering can overwhelm diffusion and create non-poissonian correlations between pairs (parent and offspring) or organisms, leading to the emergence of patterns.},

  abstract = {There is a growing recognition of the roles of marine microenvironments as reservoirs of biodiversity and as sites of enhanced biological activity and in facilitating biological interactions. Here, we examine the bacterial community inhabiting free-living and particle-associated seawater microenvironments at the Pivers Island Coastal Observatory (PICO). 16S rRNA gene libraries from monthly samples (July 2013 to August 2014) were used to identify microbes in seawater in four size fractions: {$>$}63 μm (zooplankton and large particles), 63 to 5 μm (particles), 5 to 1 μm (small particles/dividing cells), and {$<$}1 μm (free-living prokaryotes). Analyses of microbial community composition highlight the importance of the microhabitat (e.g., particle-associated versus free-living lifestyle) as communities cluster by size fraction, and the microhabitat explains more of the community variability than measured environmental parameters, including pH, particle concentration, projected daily insolation, nutrients, and temperature. While temperature is statistically associated with community changes in the {$<$}1-μm and 5- to 1-μm fractions, none of the measured bulk seawater environmental variables are statistically significant in the larger-particle-associated fractions. These results, combined with high particle-associated community variability, especially in the largest size fraction (i.e., {$>$}63 μm), suggest that particle composition, including eukaryotes and their associated microbiomes, may be an important factor in selecting for specific particle-associated bacteria. IMPORTANCE By comparing levels of particle-associated and free-living bacterial diversity at a coastal location over the course of 14 months, we show that bacteria associated with particles are generally more diverse and appear to be less responsive to commonly measured environmental variables than free-living bacteria. These diverse and highly variable particle-associated communities are likely driven by differences in particle substrates both within the water column at a single time point and due to seasonal changes over the course of the year.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that individuals with colorectal cancer have an altered gut microbiome compared to healthy controls. It remains unclear whether these differences are a response to tumorigenesis or actively drive tumorigenesis. To determine the role of the gut microbiome in the development of colorectal cancer, we characterized the gut microbiome in a murine model of inflammation-associated colorectal cancer that mirrors what is seen in humans. We followed the development of an abnormal microbial community structure associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis in the colon. Tumor-bearing mice showed enrichment in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with members of the Bacteroides, Odoribacter, and Akkermansia genera and decreases in OTUs affiliated with members of the Prevotellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae families. Conventionalization of germfree mice with microbiota from tumor-bearing mice significantly increased tumorigenesis in the colon compared to that for animals colonized with a healthy gut microbiome from untreated mice. Furthermore, at the end of the model, germfree mice colonized with microbiota from tumor-bearing mice harbored a higher relative abundance of populations associated with tumor formation in conventional animals. Manipulation of the gut microbiome with antibiotics resulted in a dramatic decrease in both the number and size of tumors. Our results demonstrate that changes in the gut microbiome associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis directly contribute to tumorigenesis and suggest that interventions affecting the composition of the microbiome may be a strategy to prevent the development of colon cancer. IMPORTANCE The trillions of bacteria that live in the gut, known collectively as the gut microbiome, are important for normal functioning of the intestine. There is now growing evidence that disruptive changes in the gut microbiome are strongly associated with the development colorectal cancer. However, how the gut microbiome changes with time during tumorigenesis and whether these changes directly contribute to disease have not been determined. We demonstrate using a mouse model of inflammation-driven colon cancer that there are dramatic, continual alterations in the microbiome during the development of tumors, which are directly responsible for tumor development. Our results suggest that interventions that target these changes in the microbiome may be an effective strategy for preventing the development of colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {Mechanistic description of the transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism is necessary for diagnostic and predictive modeling of fixed nitrogen loss in anoxic marine zones (AMZs). In a metabolic model where diverse oxygen- and nitrogencycling microbial metabolisms are described by underlying redox chemical reactions, we predict a transition from strictly aerobic to predominantly anaerobic regimes as the outcome of ecological interactions along an oxygen gradient, obviating the need for prescribed critical oxygen concentrations. Competing aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms can coexist in anoxic conditions whether these metabolisms represent obligate or facultative populations. In the coexistence regime, relative rates of aerobic and anaerobic activity are determined by the ratio of oxygen to electron donor supply. The model simulates key characteristics of AMZs, such as the accumulation of nitrite and the sustainability of anammox at higher oxygen concentrations than denitrification, and articulates how microbial biomass concentrations relate to associated water column transformation rates as a function of redox stoichiometry and energetics. Incorporating the metabolic model into an idealized two-dimensional ocean circulation results in a simulated AMZ, in which a secondary chlorophyll maximum emerges from oxygen-limited grazing, and where vertical mixing and dispersal in the oxycline also contribute to metabolic co-occurrence. The modeling approach is mechanistic yet computationally economical and suitable for global change applications.},

Plastic marine debris (PMD) collected at multiple locations in the North Atlantic was analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and next-generation sequencing to characterize the attached microbial communities. We unveiled a diverse microbial community of heterotrophs, autotrophs, predators, and symbionts, a community we refer to as the “Plastisphere”. Pits visualized in the PMD surface conformed to bacterial shapes suggesting active hydrolysis of the hydrocarbon polymer. Small-subunit rRNA gene surveys identified several hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, supporting the possibility that microbes play a role in degrading PMD. Some Plastisphere members may be opportunistic pathogens (the authors, unpublished data) such as specific members of the genus Vibrio that dominated one of our plastic samples. Plastisphere communities are distinct from surrounding surface water, implying that plastic serves as a novel ecological habitat in the open ocean. Plastic has a longer half-life than most natural floating marine substrates, and a hydrophobic surface that promotes microbial colonization and biofilm formation, differing from autochthonous substrates in the upper layers of the ocean.},

Toward the development of fast, easy, and reliable techniques, much progress has been made during the last decade for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of algal toxins. This review highlights the recent progress and new trends of these analytical and monitoring tools, ranging from in-situ quick screening protocols for the monitoring of algal blooms to mass spectrometric analysis of trace levels of various algal toxins and structural elucidation. Solid-phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) deployed in the field for the passive sampling of algal toxins has been recently validated, and improved ELISA-based methods with lower detection limits for more toxins have become commercially available for both screening and routine monitoring purposes. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with several recent mass spectrometric innovations has expanded our understanding of traditional toxins, their metabolites along with newly discovered toxins of ecological importance. Several established in vivo and in vitro bioassays will continue to be used as benchmark toxicological testing of algal toxins; however, newly emerged molecular probing techniques such as real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) have extended our ability to trace algal toxins from causative organisms at the molecular level. New chemical and biological sensors, lab-on-chip and remote sensing of blooms being developed will hold promise for early warning and routine monitoring to better manage and protect our freshwater, coastal and marine resources from adverse impact by harmful algal blooms.},

  abstract = {With the development of high-throughput and lowcost sequencing technology, a large amount of marine microbial sequences is generated. So, it is possible to research more uncultivated marine microbes. The interaction patterns of marine microbial species and marine microbial diversity are hidden in these large amount sequences. Understanding the interaction pattern and structure of marine microbe have a high potential for exploiting the marine resources. Yet, very few marine microbial interaction patterns are well characterized even with the weight of research effort presently devoted to this field. In this paper, based on the 16S rRNA tag pyrosequencing data taken monthly over 6 years at a temperate marine coastal sits in West English Channel, we employed the CROP unsupervised probabilistic Bayesian clustering algorithm to generate the operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and utilized the PCA-CMI algorithm to construct the spring, summer, fall, and winter seasonal marine microbial interaction networks. From the four seasonal microbial networks, we introduced a novel module detecting algorithm called as DIDE, by integrating the dense subgraph, edge clustering coefficient and local modularity, to detect the interaction pattern of marine microbe in four seasons. The analysis of network topological parameters shows that the four seasonal marine microbial interaction networks have characters of complex networks, and the topological structure difference among the four networks maybe caused by the seasonal environmental factors. The marine microbial interaction patterns detected by DIDE algorithm in four seasons show evidence of seasonally interaction pattern diversity. The interaction pattern diversity of fall and winter is more than that of spring and fall, which indicates that the seasonal variability might have the greatest influence on the marine microbe diversity.},

  abstract = {To test the hypothesis that particle composition has a stronger influence on the community structure of particle-attached than free-living bacteria, elemental (C/N, δ13C, and δ15N) and chemical composition of particles and the size-fractionated bacterial community composition were examined along the particle density gradient from the Pearl River to the open basin in the South China Sea. Microbial communities were collected at the three size fractions of 0.2–0.8, 0.8–3, and {$>$}3 μm, and the community composition was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V3–V4 regions). Multivariate analysis evaluating the similarities of bacterial community composition and chemical composition of particles revealed their general consistent spatial variations along the particle density gradient from freshwater to the sea basin. However, compositions of particulate organic matter were more strongly related to the free living than to the particle-attached bacterial community composition, which was composed of relatively abundant anaerobic bacteria and those taxa preferring low-oxygen conditions. This latter result might be caused by low-oxygen microzones in particles. Community network models further revealed tighter interactions within the particle-attached than in free-living bacterial communities, suggesting that a relatively confined space in particles is more favorable for interactions within the community. These analyses indicated that particle microniche properties might be important in shaping particle-attached community structure. In contrast, particulate organic matter compositions significantly influenced the free-living bacterial community probably through the release of labile or semilabile organic matter from particles contributing to the bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon.},

  abstract = {Suspended particulate inorganic matter (PIM) and particulate organic matter (POM) often exhibit significant variation both spatially and temporally in coastal oceans. The size distributions and optical properties of these particles are poorly known. Utilizing a newly developed inversion technique from the measured angular scattering pattern, we were able to examine POM and PIM in terms of detailed particle size distributions (PSD) and optical volume scattering functions (VSF), gaining further insights and knowledge of particles that will greatly improve biogeochemical investigations and remote-sensing algorithms. We report the results on two extremes or end-members of possible coastal environments, sediment-laden, turbid Mobile Bay, Alabama, USA and biologically productive, clear water Monterey Bay, California, USA. The optically inferred mass concentrations of PIM and POM, when accounting for the fractal nature of suspended particles, agreed well with the respective gravimetric determinations within the analysis and inversion uncertainty. Despite intra- and inter-site variability, the inferred PSDs in both coastal regions commonly showed an apparent background population of PIM at radii \&lt;0.6–1~μm overlaid by POM of radii between 2 and 20~μm. The PSDs also saw increased contribution by PIM at radii \&gt;50~μm. The clearly distinctive PSDs between PIM and POM provide evidence to support the Risović two-component model for suspended particulates. The shape of the VSFs, i.e., the scattering phase functions, for POM are similar between the two sites (backscattering ratio~≈~0.0015), but the PIM in Monterey Bay exhibited a higher backscattering ratio than in Mobile Bay (backscattering ratios 0.012 vs. 0.008, respectively). At both sites, the mass-specific scattering cross section values for PIM (σ [PIM]) are about 70–80\% lower than σ[POM], while the mass-specific backscattering cross section values for PIM (σb[PIM]) are 10–25\% greater than σb[POM].},

In this study, the response of bacterioplankton to a gradient of carbon (glucose) addition was investigated experimentally in a subtropical coastal environment in the absence of top-down control by viruses and flagellates. Bacterial abundance and production was stimulated by glucose addition corresponding to a gradient of glucose. Differences in the extent of stimulation suggested different bacterial life strategies under different nutrient conditions. Bacterial community diversity as revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed a unimodal productivity-diversity (number of DGGE bands) relationship after three-day incubation. DNA fingerprinting profiling and cluster analysis showed clear and gradual changes in bacterial community structure along the gradient of glucose concentrations, reflecting the competition for carbon supply among bacterial groups. Sequencing analysis of the DGGE bands disclosed the relative abundance of seven bacterial genotypes in the Alteromonadaceae and Roseovarius that gradually decreased with the glucose enrichment while two Vibrio genotypes showed the reverse increasing trend. This suggested that Vibrio was a more successful opportunist at high carbon availability.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Bacterial community structure in three rivers located in Shanghai city was studied over a 1-year period using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Subsurface samples were collected every 2 months from two study sites in each river. Water was characterized when biological samples were collected by measuring temperature, pH, chloride ion, total dissolved solids (TDS), total N and total P. complex DGGE band patterns indicated high bacterial diversity in the rivers. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that variation of the bacterial communities was higher between rivers than it was between samples from the same river. When evaluated using principal component analysis, samples collected during warmer months from any particular river tended to group together while cold-season samples generally clustered, suggesting significant seasonal impacts. Redundancy analysis was used to identify relationships between environmental factors and bacterial community composition in each individual river. Temperature, TDS, pH, TP and salt concentration were all identified as being related to bacterial community structure, with temperature being the most influential parameter in all three rivers. Our results indicated that bacterial community composition was different in the three different rivers. Even though the rivers were located in heavily disturbed urban ecosystems, temperature was the major driver of bacterial community composition, just as it is in natural systems.},

  abstract = {Planktonic Prorocentrum, a common harmful dinoflagellate, are increasing in frequency, duration, and magnitude globally, as exemplified by the number of blooms of P. minimum in Chesapeake Bay that have nearly doubled over the past 3 decades. Although the dynamics of transport and seasonal occurrence of this species have been previously described, it has been challenging to predict the timing and location of P. minimum blooms in Chesapeake Bay. We developed a new three-dimensional mechanistic model of this species that integrates physics, nutrient cycling and plankton physiology and embedded it within a coupled hydrodynamicbiogeochemical model originally developed for simulating water quality in eutrophic estuarine and coastal waters. Hindcast simulations reproduced the observed time series and spatial distribution of cell density, in particular capturing well its peak in May in the mid-to-upper part of the estuary. Timing and duration of the blooms were mostly determined by the temperaturedependent growth function, while mortality due to grazing and respiration played a minor role. The model also reproduced the pattern of overwintering populations, which are located in bottom waters of the lower Bay, and are transported upstream in spring by estuarine flow. Blooms develop in the mid-upper parts of the estuary when these transported cells encounter high nutrient concentrations from the Susquehanna River and favorable light conditions. Diagnostic analysis and model-sensitivity experiments of nutrient conditions showed that high nitrogen:phosphorus conditions favor bloom development. The model also captured the observed interannual variations in the magnitude and spatial distribution of P. minimum blooms.},

  abstract = {Several reports proposed that the extraordinary dominance of the SAR11 bacterial clade in ocean ecosystems could be a consequence of unusual mechanisms of resistance to bacteriophage infection, including /`cryptic escape/' through reduced cell size and/or K-strategist defence specialism. Alternatively, the evolution of high surface-to-volume ratios coupled with minimal genomes containing high-affinity transporters enables unusually efficient metabolism for oxidizing dissolved organic matter in the world/'s oceans that could support vast population sizes despite phage susceptibility. These ideas are important for understanding plankton ecology because they emphasize the potentially important role of top-down mechanisms in predation, thus determining the size of SAR11 populations and their concomitant role in biogeochemical cycling. Here we report the isolation of diverse SAR11 viruses belonging to two virus families in culture, for which we propose the name /`pelagiphage/', after their host. Notably, the pelagiphage genomes were highly represented in marine viral metagenomes, demonstrating their importance in nature. One of the new phages, HTVC010P, represents a new podovirus subfamily more abundant than any seen previously, in all data sets tested, and may represent one of the most abundant virus subfamilies in the biosphere. This discovery disproves the theory that SAR11 cells are immune to viral predation and is consistent with the interpretation that the success of this highly abundant microbial clade is the result of successfully evolved adaptation to resource competition.},

Roseobacters are abundant and play important biogeochemical roles in marine environments. Roseobacter and Rhodobacter genomes contain a conserved gene transfer agent (GTA) gene cluster, and GTA-mediated gene transfer has been observed in these groups of bacteria. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity of these two groups in Chesapeake Bay surface waters using a specific PCR primer set targeting the conserved Rhodobacterales GTA major capsid protein gene (g5). The g5 gene was successfully amplified from 26 Rhodobacterales isolates and the bay microbial communities using this primer set. Four g5 clone libraries were constructed from microbial assemblages representing different regions and seasons of the bay and yielded diverse sequences. In total, 12 distinct g5 clusters could be identified among 158 Chesapeake Bay clones, 11 fall within the Roseobacter clade, and one falls in the Rhodobacter clade. The vast majority of the clusters (10 out of 12) lack cultivated representatives. The composition of g5 sequences varied dramatically along the bay during the wintertime, and a distinct Roseobacter population composition between winter and summer was observed. The congruence between g5 and 16S rRNA gene phylogenies indicates that g5 may serve as a useful genetic marker to investigate diversity and abundance of Roseobacter and Rhodobacter in natural environments. The presence of the g5 gene in the natural populations of Roseobacter and Rhodobacter implies that genetic exchange through GTA transduction could be an important mechanism for maintaining the metabolic flexibility of these groups of bacteria.},

  abstract = {Phaeobacter inhibens S4Sm acts as a probiotic bacterium against the oyster pathogen Vibrio coralliilyticus. Here, we report that P. inhibens S4Sm secretes three molecules that downregulate the transcription of major virulence factors, metalloprotease genes, in V. coralliilyticus cultures. The effects of the S4Sm culture supernatant on the transcription of three genes involved in protease activity, namely, vcpA, vcpB, and vcpR (encoding metalloproteases A and B and their transcriptional regulator, respectively), were examined by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of vcpB and vcpR were reduced to 36\% and 6.6\%, respectively, compared to that in an untreated control. We constructed a V. coralliilyticus green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter strain to detect the activity of inhibitory compounds. Using a bioassay-guided approach, the molecules responsible for V. coralliilyticus protease inhibition activity were isolated from S4Sm supernatant and identified as three N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs). The three AHLs are N-(3-hydroxydecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone, N-(dodecanoyl-2,5-diene)-l-homoserine lactone, and N-(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-7-ene)-l-homoserine lactone, and their half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) against V. coralliilyticus protease activity were 0.26 μM, 3.7 μM, and 2.9 μM, respectively. Our qRT-PCR data demonstrated that exposures to the individual AHLs reduced the transcription of vcpR and vcpB. Combinations of the three AHLs (any two or all three AHLs) on V. coralliilyticus produced additive effects on protease inhibition activity. These AHL compounds may contribute to the host protective effects of S4Sm by disrupting the quorum sensing pathway that activates protease transcription of V. coralliilyticus. IMPORTANCE Probiotics represent a promising alternative strategy to control infection and disease caused by marine pathogens of aquaculturally important species. Generally, the beneficial effects of probiotics include improved water quality, control of pathogenic bacteria and their virulence, stimulation of the immune system, and improved animal growth. Previously, we isolated a probiotic bacterium, Phaeobacter inhibens S4Sm, which protects oyster larvae from Vibrio coralliilyticus RE22Sm infection. We also demonstrated that both antibiotic secretion and biofilm formation play important roles in S4Sm probiotic activity. Here, we report that P. inhibens S4Sm, an alphaproteobacterium and member of the Roseobacter clade, also secretes secondary metabolites that hijack the quorum sensing ability of V. coralliilyticus RE22Sm, suppressing virulence gene expression. This finding demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can exert their host protection by using a multipronged array of behaviors that limit the ability of pathogens to become established and cause infection.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity and its responses to environmental changes are central issues in ecology and for society. Almost all microbial biodiversity research focuses on “species” richness and abundance but not on their interactions. Although a network approach is powerful in describing ecological interactions among species, defining the network structure in a microbial community is a great challenge. Also, although the stimulating effects of elevated CO2 (eCO2) on plant growth and primary productivity are well established, its influences on belowground microbial communities, especially microbial interactions, are poorly understood. Here, a random matrix theory (RMT)-based conceptual framework for identifying functional molecular ecological networks was developed with the high-throughput functional gene array hybridization data of soil microbial communities in a long-term grassland FACE (free air, CO2 enrichment) experiment. Our results indicate that RMT is powerful in identifying functional molecular ecological networks in microbial communities. Both functional molecular ecological networks under eCO2 and ambient CO2 (aCO2) possessed the general characteristics of complex systems such as scale free, small world, modular, and hierarchical. However, the topological structures of the functional molecular ecological networks are distinctly different between eCO2 and aCO2, at the levels of the entire communities, individual functional gene categories/groups, and functional genes/sequences, suggesting that eCO2 dramatically altered the network interactions among different microbial functional genes/populations. Such a shift in network structure is also significantly correlated with soil geochemical variables. In short, elucidating network interactions in microbial communities and their responses to environmental changes is fundamentally important for research in microbial ecology, systems microbiology, and global change. IMPORTANCE Microorganisms are the foundation of the Earth’s biosphere and play integral and unique roles in various ecosystem processes and functions. In an ecosystem, various microorganisms interact with each other to form complicated networks. Elucidating network interactions and their responses to environmental changes is difficult due to the lack of appropriate experimental data and an appropriate theoretical framework. This study provides a conceptual framework to construct interaction networks in microbial communities based on high-throughput functional gene array hybridization data. It also first documents that elevated carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dramatically alters the network interactions in soil microbial communities, which could have important implications in assessing the responses of ecosystems to climate change. The conceptual framework developed allows microbiologists to address research questions unapproachable previously by focusing on network interactions beyond the listing of, e.g., the number and abundance of species. Thus, this study could represent transformative research and a paradigm shift in microbial ecology.},

  abstract = {Organic and inorganic geochemical indicators were examined in a 3-m core collected from the mesohaline region of Chesapeake Bay ŽCB. to determine how sources of organic matter ŽOM. have changed during the preceding three centuries of increasing anthropogenic influence in this region. This study also establishes the history of eutrophication and anoxiarhypoxia and relates these processes to changes in OM deposition and preservation and to historical events within the Bay’s watershed. The sediment record shows that a marked increase in organic carbon Ž35\%–50\%., biogenic silica Ž18\%. and total sulfur Ž42\%. occurs between 1934 and 1948. This transition is likely due to increasing anoxicrhypoxic bottom water conditions as indicated by an abrupt change in sulfur speciation. Lipid biomarker distributions indicate that a substantial change in the sources of OM deposited since 1934 has also occurred. Biomarker compounds derived from phytoplankton and microbial sources show a 2- to 4-fold increase in their abundance relative to total organic carbon ŽTOC. between 1948 and 1975. Using both diagenetic models and information on lipid reactivity, an effort is made to distinguish compositional changes due to changes in OM delivery Žboth quantity and quality. from changes that may be due to OM degradation. It appears that enhanced OM production in the mesohaline region of CB has contributed to the observed changes in quantity and character of OM preserved in sediments from this site. Increased inorganic fertilizer application and human population growth in the watershed are coincident with the onset of eutrophic and hypoxic conditions in CB, suggesting that anthropogenic activities within estuarine watersheds may exert a substantial influence on carbon cycling processes in estuaries and potentially the coastal ocean. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {In 1995, an extensive investigation was carried out in the Elbe Estuary in Germany. Special attention was paid to organisms, including bacteria, amoebae, ciliates, flagellates, rotifers, larvae ofDreissena polymorpha, and nematodes, dispersed in the water column and associated firmly or loosely with different types of aggregates. The abundance, size, and colonization by microorganisms of the aggregates varied during the seasons. The largest aggregates were found during spring and summer, when diatoms, rotifers, and crustaceans were present. The most aggregates were encountered in spring and from summer to autumn. Most of the species observed during the study were more common in pelagic habitats than in benthic ones. However, the presence of ciliates in the groups Hypotrichida and Sessilida as well as as flagellates in the groups Biosoecida, Cercomonadida, Choanoflagellida, Chrysomonadida, Kinetoplastida, and amoebae and some nematodes in the open water depends, upon the availability of surfaces, because they are sessile or poor swimnters, and some flagellates and amoebae need to attach themselves to an object to feed. Most organisms were much more abundant in or on aggregates than in the surrounding water during spring and summer, which indicates that aggregates enhance the habitat and promote the development of the organisms. From spring through autumn, the structure of the community associated with the aggregates is influenced by the pelagic environment. The presence of the species in the benthic community was detected only during summer.},

In the current context of global change, characterizing microbial diversity has become crucial, and new tools have been developed to overcome the methodological challenges posed by working with microbes in nature. The advent of Sanger sequencing and now next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled the resolution of microbial communities to an unprecedented degree of precision. However, to correctly interpret microbial diversity and its patterns this revolution must also consider conceptual and methodological matters. This review presents advances, gaps and caveats of these recent approaches when considering microorganisms in aquatic ecosystems. We also discuss potentials and limitations of the available methodologies, from water sampling to sequence analysis, and suggest alternative ways to incorporate results in a conceptual and methodological framework. Together, these methods will allow us to gain an unprecedented understanding of microbial diversity in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {We review the spatial distribution of toxic marine microalgal species and the impacts of all types of harmful algal events (Harmful Algal Blooms, HABs) in the Mediterranean Sea (MS), including the Black Sea, the Sea of Marmara, coastal lagoons and transitional waters, based on two databases compiled in the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). Eighty-four potentially toxic species have been detected in the MS (2,350 records), of which 16 described from these waters between 1860 and 2014 and a few suspected to have been introduced. More than half of these species (46) produce toxins that may affect human health, the remainders ichthyotoxic substances (29) or other types of toxins (9). Nevertheless, toxicity-related events are not frequent in the MS (308 records in 31 years), and mainly consist of impacts on aquaculture, caused by the dinoflagellates Dinophysis and Alexandrium, along with a few actual shellfish poisoning cases. Pseudo-nitzschia blooms are widespread, but domoic acid in shellfish rarely exceeds regulatory levels. Fish kills are probably less sporadic than reported, representing a problem at a few places along the southern MS coasts and in the Ebro River Delta. Since the last decade of the 20th century, blooms of the benthic dinoflagellates Ostreopsis cf. ovata have regularly occurred all along rocky shores of the MS, at times with human health problems caused by toxic aerosol. New records of Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa, until now reported for the westernmost and easternmost MS coasts, raise concerns about the risk of ciguatera, a syndrome so far known only for subtropical and tropical areas. Recent discoveries are the dinoflagellates Vulcanodinium rugosum, responsible for the presence of pinnatoxins in French lagoons’ shellfish, and the azaspiracid-producers Azadinium spp. Mucilages and discolorations have a major impact on tourism in summer. Reports of toxic species and HABs have apparently increased in the MS over the last half century, which is likely related to the increased awareness and monitoring operations rather than to an actual increase of these phenomena. Indeed, while the case of Ostreopsis appears as a sudden upsurge rather than a trend, no actual increase of toxic or noxious events has so far emerged in intensively studied areas, such as the French and Spanish coasts or the Adriatic Sea. Moreover, some cases of decrease are reported, e.g., for Alexandrium minutum blooms disappearing from the Harbour of Alexandria. Overall, main HAB risks derive from cases of massive development of microalgal biomass and consequent impacts of reduced coastal water quality on tourism, which represents the largest part of the marine economy along the MS coasts.},

  abstract = {A novel anaerobic consortium, named DehaloR\^2, that performs rapid and complete reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene (TCE) to ethene is described. DehaloR\^2 was developed from estuarine sediment from the Back River of the Chesapeake Bay and has been stably maintained in the laboratory for over 2 years. Initial sediment microcosms showed incomplete reduction of TCE to DCE with a ratio of trans- to cis- isomers of 1.67. However, complete reduction to ethene was achieved within 10 days after transfer of the consortium to sediment-free media and was accompanied by a shift to cis-DCE as the prevailing intermediate metabolite. The microbial community shifted from dominance of the Proteobacterial phylum in the sediment to Firmicutes and Chloroflexi in DehaloR\^2, containing the genera Acetobacterium, Clostridium, and the dechlorinators Dehalococcoides. Also present were Spirochaetes, possible acetogens, and Geobacter which encompass previously described dechlorinators. Rates of TCE to ethene reductive dechlorination reached 2.83 mM Cl− d−1 in batch bottles with a Dehalococcoides sp. density of 1.54E+11 gene copies per liter, comparing favorably to other enrichment cultures described in the literature and identifying DehaloR\^2 as a promising consortium for use in bioremediation of chlorinated ethene-impacted environments.},

  abstract = {An on-board microcosm experiment was set up to test the hypothesis that the observed lack of phytoplankton biomass increase response to a mesoscale in situ P-enrichment experiment in the P-limited Eastern Mediterranean (Krom et al., 2005a) was a consequence of co-limitation by P and N availability in this ultraoligotrophic environment. Six microcosms were filled with subsurface seawater (ambient DIN: 90–100 nM) taken from inside a P-enriched patch (IN), which in the absence of biological activity would have had ca. 22 nM of PO4−3. Another six microcosms were filled with unfertilized (\&lt;2 nM PO4−3) subsurface seawater from outside the patch (OUT). The bottles were either supplemented with 1600 nM NH4+ or not, incubated on-deck and subsampled daily, or at the first and last (fourth) day of the experiment, for a suite of biological parameters. The addition of N to OUT water did not induce cell abundance increases in either the phototrophic or heterotrophic sides of the food chain, in line with previous assessments that the Eastern Mediterranean is not purely N-limited. The IN and OUT treatments, to which no NH4+ was added, mimicked the behavior of the in situ experiment, with an order of magnitude higher bacterial production of IN vs. OUT water, but no noticeable phytoplankton response. The addition of N to IN water, previously exposed to P, led to substantial responses of the entire microbial community, including 4 to 80-fold increases in chlorophyll, other pigments, bacterial activity, and the abundance of ciliates—relative to IN water to which N was not added. The ca. 10-fold increase in chlorophyll within 4 days was mostly due to a major increase in both abundance (×4) and fluorescence per cell (×17) of Synechococcus, whereas Prochlorococcus disappeared. These changes were accompanied by removal from the water of 570 nM of the added NH4+, equivalent to 570/22 or N : P ratio of 26 : 1, similar to the ratio measured for POM in the area. Possibly, non-Redfield ratios were maintained, still leaving by day 4 some 1100 nM of N that could not be used due to the lack of P. These results support our hypothesis that the lack of response of phytoplankton to the mesoscale P-enrichment was due to their concurrent N-starvation, i.e. N and P co-limitation. In contrast, bacteria could grow when only P was added, implying pure P-limitation. Thus, the heterotrophic and autotrophic components of the same aquatic community experienced different limitations.},

  abstract = {To examine the grazing effects of copepod-dominated mesozooplankton on heterotrophic microbial communities, four mesocosm experiments using gradients of zooplankton abundance were carried out at a coastal marine site. The responses of different protist groups (nanoflagellates, ciliates) and bacterioplankton in terms of abundance and additionally, for bacteria, diversity, production, and exoenzymatic activity, were monitored during 1 week of incubation. Independent of the initial experimental abiotic conditions and the dominating copepod species, zooplankton caused order-of-magnitude changes in microbial functional groups in a clear community-wide four-link trophic cascade. The strongest predatory effects were observed for protist concentrations, thus generating inverse relationships between mesozooplankton and ciliates and between ciliates and nanoplankton. Copepod grazing effects propagated even further, not only reducing the abundance, production, and hydrolytic activity of bacterioplankton but also increasing bacterial diversity. The overall strength of this trophic cascade was dampened with respect to bacterial numbers, but more pronounced with respect to bacterial diversity and activity. High predation pressure by heterotrophic nanoflagellates, realized at the highest copepod abundance, was probably the underlying mechanism for these structural changes in the bacterial assemblages. Our results thus suggest a mechanism by which changes in higher trophic levels of marine plankton indirectly affect prokaryotic assemblages and microbially mediated ecosystem functions.},
