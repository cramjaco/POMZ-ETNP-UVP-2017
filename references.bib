  abstract = {The ``transfer efficiency'' of organic particles from the surface to depth is a critical determinant of ocean carbon sequestration. Recently, direct observations and geochemical analyses have revealed a systematic geographical pattern of transfer efficiency, which is highest in high latitude regions and lowest in the subtropical gyres. We evaluate the possible causes of this pattern using a mechanistic model of sinking particle dynamics. The model represents the size distribution of particles, the effects of mineral ballast, seawater temperature (which influences both particle settling velocity and microbial metabolic rates), and O2. Parameters are optimized within reasonable ranges to best match the observational constraints. Our model shows that no single factor can explain the observed pattern of transfer efficiency, but the biological effect of temperature on remineralization rate and particle size effects together can reproduce most of the regional variability with both factors contributing to low transfer efficiency in the subtropical gyres and high transfer efficiency in high latitudes. Particle density from mineral ballast has a similar directional effect to temperature and size but plays a substantially smaller role in our optimum solution, due to the opposing patterns of silicate and calcium carbonate ballasting. Oxygen effects modestly improved model fit by depressing remineralization rates and thus increasing transfer efficiency in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Our model implies that climate-driven changes to upper ocean temperature and associated changes in surface plankton size distribution would reduce the carbon sequestration efficiency in a warmer ocean.},

  abstract = {Long-term declines in oxygen concentrations are evident throughout much of the ocean interior and are particularly acute in midwater oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). These regions are defined by extremely low oxygen concentrations ({$<$}20\textendash 45 {$\mu$}mol kg-1), cover wide expanses of the ocean, and are associated with productive oceanic and coastal regions. OMZs have expanded over the past 50 years, and this expansion is predicted to continue as the climate warms worldwide. Shoaling of the upper boundaries of the OMZs accompanies OMZ expansion, and decreased oxygen at shallower depths can affect all marine organisms through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. Effects include altered microbial processes that produce and consume key nutrients and gases, changes in predator-prey dynamics, and shifts in the abundance and accessibility of commercially fished species. Although many species will be negatively affected by these effects, others may expand their range or exploit new niches. OMZ shoaling is thus likely to have major and far-reaching consequences.},

  abstract = {The downward flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) decreases significantly in the ocean's mesopelagic or 'twilight' zone due both to abiotic processes and metabolism by resident biota. Bacteria and zooplankton solubilize and consume POC to support their metabolism, but the relative importance of bacteria vs. zooplankton in the consumption of sinking particles in the twilight zone is unknown. We compared losses of sinking POC, using differences in export flux measured by neutrally buoyant sediment traps at a range of depths, with bacteria and zooplankton metabolic requirements at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series station ALOHA in the subtropical Pacific and the Japanese times-series site K2 in the subarctic Pacific. Integrated (150-1,000 m) mesopelagic bacterial C demand exceeded that of zooplankton by up to 3-fold at ALOHA, while bacteria and zooplankton required relatively equal amounts of POC at K2. However, sinking POC flux was inadequate to meet metabolic demands at either site. Mesopelagic bacterial C demand was 3- to 4-fold (ALOHA), and 10-fold (K2) greater than the loss of sinking POC flux, while zooplankton C demand was 1- to 2-fold (ALOHA), and 3- to 9-fold (K2) greater (using our {"}middle{"} estimate conversion factors to calculate C demand). Assuming the particle flux estimates are accurate, we posit that this additional C demand must be met by diel vertical migration of zooplankton feeding at the surface and by carnivory at depth--with both processes ultimately supplying organic C to mesopelagic bacteria. These pathways need to be incorporated into biogeochemical models that predict global C sequestration in the deep sea.},

  abstract = {Marine zooplankton comprise a phylogenetically and functionally diverse assemblage of protistan and metazoan consumers that occupy multiple trophic levels in pelagic food webs. Within this complex network, carbon flows via alternative zooplankton pathways drive temporal and spatial variability in production-grazing coupling, nutrient cycling, export, and transfer efficiency to higher trophic levels. We explore current knowledge of the processing of zooplankton food ingestion by absorption, egestion, respiration, excretion, and growth (production) processes. On a global scale, carbon fluxes are reasonably constrained by the grazing impact of microzooplankton and the respiratory requirements of mesozooplankton but are sensitive to uncertainties in trophic structure. The relative importance, combined magnitude, and efficiency of export mechanisms (mucous feeding webs, fecal pellets, molts, carcasses, and vertical migrations) likewise reflect regional variability in community structure. Climate change is expected to broadly alter carbon cycling by zooplankton and to have direct impacts on key species.},

  abstract = {Zooplankton organisms are a central part of pelagic ecosystems. They feed on all kinds of particulate matter and their egested fecal pellets contribute substantially to the passive sinking flux to depth. Some zooplankton species also conduct diel vertical migrations (DVMs) between the surface layer (where they feed at nighttime) and midwater depth (where they hide at daytime from predation). These DVMs cause the active export of organic and inorganic matter from the surface layer as zooplankton organisms excrete, defecate, respire, die, and are preyed upon at depth. In the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA), the daytime distribution depth of many migrators (300\textendash 600 m) coincides with an expanding and intensifying oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We here assess the day and night-time biomass distribution of mesozooplankton with an equivalent spherical diameter of 0.39\textendash 20 mm in three regions of the ETNA, calculate the DVM-mediated fluxes and compare these to particulate matter fluxes and other biogeochemical processes. Integrated mesozooplankton biomass in the ETNA region is about twice as high at a central OMZ location (cOMZ; 11{$\smwhtcircle$} N, 21{$\smwhtcircle$} W) compared to the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory (CVOO; 17.6{$\smwhtcircle$} N, 24.3{$\smwhtcircle$} W) and an oligotrophic location at 5{$\smwhtcircle$} N, 23{$\smwhtcircle$} W (5N). An Intermediate Particle Maximum (IPM) is particularly strong at cOMZ compared to the other regions. This IPM seems to be related to DVM activity. Zooplankton DVM was found to be responsible for about 31\textendash 41\% of nitrogen loss from the upper 200m of the water column. Gut flux and mortality make up about 31\% of particulate matter supply to the 300\textendash 600 m depth layer at cOMZ, whereas it makes up about 32\% and 41\% at CVOO and 5N, respectively. Resident and migrant zooplankton are responsible for about 7\textendash 27\% of the total oxygen demand at 300\textendash 600 m depth. Changes in zooplankton abundance and migration behavior due to decreasing oxygen levels at midwater depth could therefore alter the elemental cycling of oxygen and carbon in the ETNA OMZ and impact the removal of nitrogen from the surface layer.},
