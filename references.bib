OMZs have expanded over the past 50 years, and this expansion is predicted to continue as the climate warms worldwide. Shoaling of the upper boundaries of the OMZs accompanies OMZ expansion, and decreased oxygen at shallower depths can affect all marine organisms through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. Effects include altered microbial processes that produce and consume key nutrients and gases, changes in predator-prey dynamics, and shifts in the abundance and accessibility of commercially fished species. Although many species will be negatively affected by these effects, others may expand their range or exploit new niches. OMZ shoaling is thus likely to have major and far-reaching consequences.},

  abstract = {The downward flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) decreases significantly in the ocean's mesopelagic or 'twilight' zone due both to abiotic processes and metabolism by resident biota. Bacteria and zooplankton solubilize and consume POC to support their metabolism, but the relative importance of bacteria vs. zooplankton in the consumption of sinking particles in the twilight zone is unknown. We compared losses of sinking POC, using differences in export flux measured by neutrally buoyant sediment traps at a range of depths, with bacteria and zooplankton metabolic requirements at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series station ALOHA in the subtropical Pacific and the Japanese times-series site K2 in the subarctic Pacific. Integrated (150-1,000 m) mesopelagic bacterial C demand exceeded that of zooplankton by up to 3-fold at ALOHA, while bacteria and zooplankton required relatively equal amounts of POC at K2. However, sinking POC flux was inadequate to meet metabolic demands at either site. Mesopelagic bacterial C demand was 3- to 4-fold (ALOHA), and 10-fold (K2) greater than the loss of sinking POC flux, while zooplankton C demand was 1- to 2-fold (ALOHA), and 3- to 9-fold (K2) greater (using our {"}middle{"} estimate conversion factors to calculate C demand). Assuming the particle flux estimates are accurate, we posit that this additional C demand must be met by diel vertical migration of zooplankton feeding at the surface and by carnivory at depth--with both processes ultimately supplying organic C to mesopelagic bacteria. These pathways need to be incorporated into biogeochemical models that predict global C sequestration in the deep sea.},

Within this complex network, carbon flows via alternative zooplankton pathways drive temporal and spatial variability in production-grazing coupling, nutrient cycling, export, and transfer efficiency to higher trophic levels. We explore current knowledge of the processing of zooplankton food ingestion by absorption, egestion, respiration, excretion, and growth (production) processes. On a global scale, carbon fluxes are reasonably constrained by the grazing impact of microzooplankton and the respiratory requirements of mesozooplankton but are sensitive to uncertainties in trophic structure. The relative importance, combined magnitude, and efficiency of export mechanisms (mucous feeding webs, fecal pellets, molts, carcasses, and vertical migrations) likewise reflect regional variability in community structure. Climate change is expected to broadly alter carbon cycling by zooplankton and to have direct impacts on key species.},

  abstract = {Zooplankton organisms are a central part of pelagic ecosystems. They feed on all kinds of particulate matter and their egested fecal pellets contribute substantially to the passive sinking flux to depth. Some zooplankton species also conduct diel vertical migrations (DVMs) between the surface layer (where they feed at nighttime) and midwater depth (where they hide at daytime from predation). These DVMs cause the active export of organic and inorganic matter from the surface layer as zooplankton organisms excrete, defecate, respire, die, and are preyed upon at depth. In the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA), the daytime distribution depth of many migrators (300\textendash 600 m) coincides with an expanding and intensifying oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We here assess the day and night-time biomass distribution of mesozooplankton with an equivalent spherical diameter of 0.39\textendash 20 mm in three regions of the ETNA, calculate the DVM-mediated fluxes and compare these to particulate matter fluxes and other biogeochemical processes. Integrated mesozooplankton biomass in the ETNA region is about twice as high at a central OMZ location (cOMZ; 11{$\smwhtcircle$} N, 21{$\smwhtcircle$} W) compared to the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory (CVOO; 17.6{$\smwhtcircle$} N, 24.3{$\smwhtcircle$} W) and an oligotrophic location at 5{$\smwhtcircle$} N, 23{$\smwhtcircle$} W (5N). An Intermediate Particle Maximum (IPM) is particularly strong at cOMZ compared to the other regions. This IPM seems to be related to DVM activity. Zooplankton DVM was found to be responsible for about 31\textendash 41\% of nitrogen loss from the upper 200m of the water column. Gut flux and mortality make up about 31\% of particulate matter supply to the 300\textendash 600 m depth layer at cOMZ, whereas it makes up about 32\% and 41\% at CVOO and 5N, respectively. Resident and migrant zooplankton are responsible for about 7\textendash 27\% of the total oxygen demand at 300\textendash 600 m depth. Changes in zooplankton abundance and migration behavior due to decreasing oxygen levels at midwater depth could therefore alter the elemental cycling of oxygen and carbon in the ETNA OMZ and impact the removal of nitrogen from the surface layer.},

  abstract = {The Biological Carbon Pump includes all those processes in the ocean that cause organic carbon formed photosynthetically by phytoplankton (primary production) in the sunlit surface layer (the euphotic zone) to be removed from contact with the atmosphere. It is a mechanism that sequesters carbon dioxide (CO2) for weeks to hundreds or even millions of years (geological time-scales). Together with the physical carbon pump, the biological carbon pump constitutes the ocean's CO2 sink, and these two major processes in the global carbon cycle have removed about 2- 2.5 Pg Carbon per year (last decade average)(I Pg=1015g). Today, about half of the CO2 emitted from fossil fuel burning and land use changes remains in the atmosphere, and the other half is captured by land sinks and the ocean. The modern carbon cycle is often completely separated from the short- and long-term carbon cycles of the geological past, and students from biology or biogeochemistry rarely learn about these processes and the respective timescales in a joint lecture. The purpose of this interdisciplinary lecture thus is to cover processes related to the biological carbon pump and how it functions, while paying close attention to the relevant timescales in the global carbon cycle. Note that we focus mainly on the production and sinking of particulates, we do not delve into detailed mechanisms of carbon sequestration due to the removal of dissolved organic matter. Topics will include an introduction to the different carbon pumps (biological, carbonate and physical), followed by a detailed process-oriented introduction to the biological carbon pumps. This will also include the organismal aspects, such as an introduction to phytoplankton, primary production, distribution of primary producers in the global ocean, and the role of zooplankton in the biological carbon pump. More mechanistic aspects follow, such as the concepts of new and export production, the flux attenuation and the role of mineral ballasting. We cover specific aspects of the lecture as modules (Excursions) that give the reader/lecturer the chance to explore some topics in greater detail. These 'Excursions' are entitled 'Instrumentation: Quantifying Particle Flux', 'Particle Sinking and Degradation' and 'The Biological Carbon Pump on Geological Timescales'. The lecture is intended for senior undergraduates/graduates students and can be used in courses such as Oceanography, Biogeochemistry, Geology, and Environmental Life Sciences.},

  abstract = {Particle fluxes measured with time series sediment traps deployed below 2000 m at 68 sites in the world ocean are combined with satellite-derived estimates of export production from the overlying water to assess the factors affecting the transfer of particulate organic matter from surface to deep water. Multiple linear regression is used to derive an algorithm suggesting that the transfer efficiency of organic carbon, defined as the settling flux of organic carbon normalized to export production, increases with the flux of carbonate and decreases with water depth and seasonality. The algorithm predicts {$>$}80\% of the organic carbon transfer efficiency variability in diverse oceanic regions. The influence of the carbonate flux suggests that the ballasting effect of this biogenic mineral may be an important factor promoting export of organic carbon to the deep sea by increasing the density of settling particles. However, the lack of a similar effect for biogenic opal suggests that factors other than particle density also play a role. The adverse effect of increasing seasonality on the transfer efficiency of carbon to the deep sea is tentatively attributed to greater biodegradability of organic matter exported during bloom events.

  abstract = {Particle fluxes measured with time series sediment traps deployed below 2000 m at 68 sites in the world ocean are combined with satellite-derived estimates of export production from the overlying water to assess the factors affecting the transfer of particulate organic matter from surface to deep water. Multiple linear regression is used to derive an algorithm suggesting that the transfer efficiency of organic carbon, defined as the settling flux of organic carbon normalized to export production, increases with the flux of carbonate and decreases with water depth and seasonality. The algorithm predicts {$>$}80\% of the organic carbon transfer efficiency variability in diverse oceanic regions. The influence of the carbonate flux suggests that the ballasting effect of this biogenic mineral may be an important factor promoting export of organic carbon to the deep sea by increasing the density of settling particles. However, the lack of a similar effect for biogenic opal suggests that factors other than particle density also play a role. The adverse effect of increasing seasonality on the transfer efficiency of carbon to the deep sea is tentatively attributed to greater biodegradability of organic matter exported during bloom events. In high latitude opal-dominated regions with high f-ratios and seasonality, while a higher fraction of net production is exported, a higher fraction of the exported organic matter is remineralized before reaching bathypelagic depths. On the other hand, in warm, low latitude, carbonate-dominated regions with low f-ratios and seasonality, a higher fraction of the exported organic matter sinks to the deep sea.},

Despite its importance in the global carbon cycle, the biological processes that control BCPeff are poorly known. We investigate the potential role that zooplankton play in the biological carbon pump using both in situ observations and model output. Observed and modelled estimates of fast, slow and total sinking fluxes are presented from three oceanic sites: the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, the temperate North Atlantic and the equatorial Pacific oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We find that observed particle export efficiency is inversely related to primary production likely due to zooplankton grazing, in direct contrast to the model estimates. The model and observations show strongest agreement in remineralization coefficients and BCPeff at the OMZ site where zooplankton processing of particles in the mesopelagic zone is thought to be low. As the model has limited representation of zooplankton-mediated remineralization processes, we suggest that these results point to the importance of zooplankton in setting BCPeff, including particle grazing and fragmentation, and the effect of diel vertical migration. We suggest that improving parameterizations of zooplankton processes may increase the fidelity of biogeochemical model estimates of the biological carbon pump. Future changes in climate such as the expansion of OMZs may decrease the role of zooplankton in the biological carbon pump globally, hence increasing its efficiency.},

  abstract = {Sinking of marine snow is a major mechanism of particulate carbon transport from surface waters to the seafloor. Any process altering the abundance or size of marine snow influences carbon flux and food availability to pelagic and benthic organisms. We explored whether zooplankton can alter carbon transport by a new mechanism\textemdash physical fragmentation of marine snow. The fluid stress created around the appendages of swimming Euphausia pacifica is capable of fragmenting a single aggregate into multiple, smaller aggregates. The reduced size and slower sinking rate of the daughter aggregates may increase their residence time in the water column, promoting decomposition and decreasing particle flux to depth. To determine the importance of fragmentation, tethered and free-swimming euphausiids were videotaped in the presence of marine snow representing a range of aggregate strengths, sizes, and ages. Image analysis was used to characterize the particles prior to and following fragmentation and to determine the area of influence around a single euphausiid. Tethered euphausiids pulled in particles from an average of 6.7 mm away, and most aggregates were fragmented in either the region of the rapidly beating pleopods or in the high-velocity jet that forms off the tail. Euphausiids were capable of fragmenting all aggregate types and produced an average of 7.3 daughter particles, with 60\% of these daughter particles remaining within the marine snow size class ({$>$}0.5 mm). Thus, physical fragmentation by swimming euphausiids increases the abundance of marine snow while decreasing overall marine snow mass. This novel process, which alters particle size structure without loss of total particulate organic carbon (POC), will be important in upwelling regions where euphausiids are the dominant macrozooplankton migrators.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The vast majority of carbon lost from ocean surface waters sinks as large, relatively rare, marine snow and fecal pellets. Fragmentation of these particles into more slowly sinking daughter particles has been proposed previously to partly explain the rapid loss of sinking carbon below the mixed layer. In this study we investigated 2 other less obvious potential consequences of aggregate disruption, namely the release of dissolved interstitial compounds upon fragmentation and accelerated degradation due to increased particle surface area. We found that upon fragmentation natural marine aggregates, ranging in size from 3 to 6 mm diameter, released dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (mean 0.12 {$\mu$}mol aggregate\textendash 1) and nitrate (mean of 0.013 {$\mu$}mol aggregate\textendash 1) into surrounding seawater, making these nutrients available to free-living biota. Filtration of whole aggregates failed to result in an equivalent release, suggesting that marine snow may not be as leaky as expected based on high aggregate porosity. Decomposition of aggregate particulate organic carbon (POC) to DOC was similar for whole and fragmented aggregates ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 {$\mu$}mol POC aggregate\textendash 1 d\textendash 1, resulting in calculated aggregate POC turnover times of 2 to 11 d. Remineralization of DOC was also similar for both aggregate treatments and suggested a tight coupling between solubilization and uptake by attached bacteria. Our results indicate that the longer residence times predicted for smaller aggregates in the mixed layer, rather than changes in decomposition rate, may be the most influential impact of aggregate fragmentation on reduction of particle flux to depth.},

Recent work suggests that the resident zooplankton fragment, rather than ingest, the majority of encountered organic particles, thereby stimulating bacterial proliferation and the deep-ocean microbial food web. Here we speculate that this apparently counterintuitive behaviour is an example of 'microbial gardening', a strategy that exploits the enzymatic and biosynthetic capabilities of microorganisms to facilitate the 'gardener's' access to a suite of otherwise unavailable compounds that are essential for metazoan life.

  abstract = {Fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) through the oxygen deficient waters in the eastern tropical North Pacific were found to be relatively less attenuated with depth than elsewhere in the eastern North Pacific. The attenuation coefficient (b) for the flux was found to be 0.40 versus the composite value of 0.86 determined by Martin et al. (1987). To examine this further, sinking POC was collected using sediment traps and allowed to degrade in oxic and suboxic experiments. Using a kinetic model, it was found that degradation proceeded at similar rates (roughly 0.8 day-1) under oxic and suboxic conditions, but a greater fraction of bulk POC was resistant to degradation in the suboxic experiments (61\% vs. 23\%). Amino acids accounted for 37\% of POC collected at 75m, but following degradation the value dropped to 17\% and 16\% in the oxic and suboxic experiments respectively. POC collected from 500m was 10\% amino acids. The non-AA component of POC collected at 75m was not degraded under suboxic conditions, while under oxic conditions it was. These results suggest that microbes degrading OC under suboxic conditions via denitrification preferentially utilize nitrogen-rich amino acids. This preferential degradation of amino acids suggests that 9\% more nitrogen may be lost via water column denitrification than is accounted for when a more ``Redfieldian'' stoichiometry for POC is assumed.},

Two locations (19.5 and 15.5\textdegree -N) were within the permanently oxygen-deficient zone (ODZ), and a third (11\textdegree -N) had a shallow and thin oxygen minimum. The secondary nitrite maximum, which serves as a tracer of the ODZ, thinned from 250-m thick at stations 19.5 and 15.5\textdegree -N to 50-m thick at station 11\textdegree -N. Overall, organic carbon fluxes ranged from 13.2-g-m\textsuperscript{2}-yr\textsuperscript{-1} at 80-m to a minimum of 1.1-g-m\textsuperscript{2}-yr\textsuperscript{-1} at 500-m. Fluxes at the more oxygenated 11\textdegree -N station attenuate faster than within the permanent ODZ. Martin curve attenuation coefficients for 19.5 and 15.5\textdegree -N are respectively 0.59 and 0.63 and for 11\textdegree -N it is 0.98. At least six potential mechanisms might explain why particles sinking through the ODZ are more effectively transferred to depth: (M1) oxygen effects, (M2) microbial loop efficiencies and chemoautotrophy, (M3) changes in zooplankton dynamics, (M4) additions of ballast that might sorb and protect organic matter from decay (M4a) or change sinking speeds (M4b), (M5) inputs of refractory organic matter and (M6) temperature effects. These mechanisms are intertwined, and they were explored using a combination of mineral (XPS) and organic matter characterizations of the sinking material, shipboard incubation experiments, and evaluations of existing literature. Direct evidence was found supporting an oxygen effect and/or changes in the efficiency of the microbial loop including the addition of chemoautotrophic carbon to the sinking flux in the upper 500-m. Less direct evidence was found for the other potential mechanisms. A simple conceptual model consistent with our and other recent data suggests that the upper ODZ microbial community determines the initial flux attenuation, and that zooplankton and sinking speed become more important deeper in the water column. The exact interplay between the various mechanisms remains to be further evaluated.},

  abstract = {The remineralization depth of sinking organic particles controls the efficiency of the biological carbon pump by setting the sequestration timescale of remineralized carbon in the ocean interior. Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) have been identified as regions of elevated particle transfer and efficient carbon sequestration at depth, but direct measurements remain sparse in these regions and only provide snapshots of the particle flux. Here, we use remineralization tracers to reconstruct time-mean particle flux profiles in the OMZs of the Eastern Tropical Pacific and the Arabian Sea. Compared to the surrounding tropical waters, both OMZs exhibit slow flux attenuation between 100-1000m where suboxic waters reside, and sequester carbon beneath 1000m more than twice as efficiently. Using a mechanistic model of particle sinking, remineralization, and disaggregation, we show that three different mechanisms might explain the shape of the OMZ flux profiles: (i) a significant slow-down of remineralization when carbon oxidation transitions from aerobic to anaerobic respiration (e.g. denitrification); (ii) the exclusion of zooplankton that mediate disaggregation of large particles from suboxic waters (iii) the limitation of remineralization by the diffusive supply of oxidants (oxygen and nitrate) into large particles. We show that each mechanism leaves a unique signature in the size distribution of particles, suggesting that observations with optical instruments such as Underwater Vision Profilers hold great promise for understanding the drivers of efficient carbon transfer though suboxic water columns. In turn, this will allow more accurate prediction of future changes in carbon sequestration as the ocean loses oxygen in a warming climate.},
