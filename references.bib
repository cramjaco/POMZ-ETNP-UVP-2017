OMZs have expanded over the past 50 years, and this expansion is predicted to continue as the climate warms worldwide. Shoaling of the upper boundaries of the OMZs accompanies OMZ expansion, and decreased oxygen at shallower depths can affect all marine organisms through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. Effects include altered microbial processes that produce and consume key nutrients and gases, changes in predator-prey dynamics, and shifts in the abundance and accessibility of commercially fished species. Although many species will be negatively affected by these effects, others may expand their range or exploit new niches. OMZ shoaling is thus likely to have major and far-reaching consequences.},

  abstract = {The downward flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) decreases significantly in the ocean's mesopelagic or 'twilight' zone due both to abiotic processes and metabolism by resident biota. Bacteria and zooplankton solubilize and consume POC to support their metabolism, but the relative importance of bacteria vs. zooplankton in the consumption of sinking particles in the twilight zone is unknown. We compared losses of sinking POC, using differences in export flux measured by neutrally buoyant sediment traps at a range of depths, with bacteria and zooplankton metabolic requirements at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series station ALOHA in the subtropical Pacific and the Japanese times-series site K2 in the subarctic Pacific. Integrated (150-1,000 m) mesopelagic bacterial C demand exceeded that of zooplankton by up to 3-fold at ALOHA, while bacteria and zooplankton required relatively equal amounts of POC at K2. However, sinking POC flux was inadequate to meet metabolic demands at either site. Mesopelagic bacterial C demand was 3- to 4-fold (ALOHA), and 10-fold (K2) greater than the loss of sinking POC flux, while zooplankton C demand was 1- to 2-fold (ALOHA), and 3- to 9-fold (K2) greater (using our {"}middle{"} estimate conversion factors to calculate C demand). Assuming the particle flux estimates are accurate, we posit that this additional C demand must be met by diel vertical migration of zooplankton feeding at the surface and by carnivory at depth--with both processes ultimately supplying organic C to mesopelagic bacteria. These pathways need to be incorporated into biogeochemical models that predict global C sequestration in the deep sea.},

Within this complex network, carbon flows via alternative zooplankton pathways drive temporal and spatial variability in production-grazing coupling, nutrient cycling, export, and transfer efficiency to higher trophic levels. We explore current knowledge of the processing of zooplankton food ingestion by absorption, egestion, respiration, excretion, and growth (production) processes. On a global scale, carbon fluxes are reasonably constrained by the grazing impact of microzooplankton and the respiratory requirements of mesozooplankton but are sensitive to uncertainties in trophic structure. The relative importance, combined magnitude, and efficiency of export mechanisms (mucous feeding webs, fecal pellets, molts, carcasses, and vertical migrations) likewise reflect regional variability in community structure. Climate change is expected to broadly alter carbon cycling by zooplankton and to have direct impacts on key species.},

  abstract = {Zooplankton organisms are a central part of pelagic ecosystems. They feed on all kinds of particulate matter and their egested fecal pellets contribute substantially to the passive sinking flux to depth. Some zooplankton species also conduct diel vertical migrations (DVMs) between the surface layer (where they feed at nighttime) and midwater depth (where they hide at daytime from predation). These DVMs cause the active export of organic and inorganic matter from the surface layer as zooplankton organisms excrete, defecate, respire, die, and are preyed upon at depth. In the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA), the daytime distribution depth of many migrators (300\textendash 600 m) coincides with an expanding and intensifying oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We here assess the day and night-time biomass distribution of mesozooplankton with an equivalent spherical diameter of 0.39\textendash 20 mm in three regions of the ETNA, calculate the DVM-mediated fluxes and compare these to particulate matter fluxes and other biogeochemical processes. Integrated mesozooplankton biomass in the ETNA region is about twice as high at a central OMZ location (cOMZ; 11{$\smwhtcircle$} N, 21{$\smwhtcircle$} W) compared to the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory (CVOO; 17.6{$\smwhtcircle$} N, 24.3{$\smwhtcircle$} W) and an oligotrophic location at 5{$\smwhtcircle$} N, 23{$\smwhtcircle$} W (5N). An Intermediate Particle Maximum (IPM) is particularly strong at cOMZ compared to the other regions. This IPM seems to be related to DVM activity. Zooplankton DVM was found to be responsible for about 31\textendash 41\% of nitrogen loss from the upper 200m of the water column. Gut flux and mortality make up about 31\% of particulate matter supply to the 300\textendash 600 m depth layer at cOMZ, whereas it makes up about 32\% and 41\% at CVOO and 5N, respectively. Resident and migrant zooplankton are responsible for about 7\textendash 27\% of the total oxygen demand at 300\textendash 600 m depth. Changes in zooplankton abundance and migration behavior due to decreasing oxygen levels at midwater depth could therefore alter the elemental cycling of oxygen and carbon in the ETNA OMZ and impact the removal of nitrogen from the surface layer.},

  abstract = {The Biological Carbon Pump includes all those processes in the ocean that cause organic carbon formed photosynthetically by phytoplankton (primary production) in the sunlit surface layer (the euphotic zone) to be removed from contact with the atmosphere. It is a mechanism that sequesters carbon dioxide (CO2) for weeks to hundreds or even millions of years (geological time-scales). Together with the physical carbon pump, the biological carbon pump constitutes the ocean's CO2 sink, and these two major processes in the global carbon cycle have removed about 2- 2.5 Pg Carbon per year (last decade average)(I Pg=1015g). Today, about half of the CO2 emitted from fossil fuel burning and land use changes remains in the atmosphere, and the other half is captured by land sinks and the ocean. The modern carbon cycle is often completely separated from the short- and long-term carbon cycles of the geological past, and students from biology or biogeochemistry rarely learn about these processes and the respective timescales in a joint lecture. The purpose of this interdisciplinary lecture thus is to cover processes related to the biological carbon pump and how it functions, while paying close attention to the relevant timescales in the global carbon cycle. Note that we focus mainly on the production and sinking of particulates, we do not delve into detailed mechanisms of carbon sequestration due to the removal of dissolved organic matter. Topics will include an introduction to the different carbon pumps (biological, carbonate and physical), followed by a detailed process-oriented introduction to the biological carbon pumps. This will also include the organismal aspects, such as an introduction to phytoplankton, primary production, distribution of primary producers in the global ocean, and the role of zooplankton in the biological carbon pump. More mechanistic aspects follow, such as the concepts of new and export production, the flux attenuation and the role of mineral ballasting. We cover specific aspects of the lecture as modules (Excursions) that give the reader/lecturer the chance to explore some topics in greater detail. These 'Excursions' are entitled 'Instrumentation: Quantifying Particle Flux', 'Particle Sinking and Degradation' and 'The Biological Carbon Pump on Geological Timescales'. The lecture is intended for senior undergraduates/graduates students and can be used in courses such as Oceanography, Biogeochemistry, Geology, and Environmental Life Sciences.},

  abstract = {Particle fluxes measured with time series sediment traps deployed below 2000 m at 68 sites in the world ocean are combined with satellite-derived estimates of export production from the overlying water to assess the factors affecting the transfer of particulate organic matter from surface to deep water. Multiple linear regression is used to derive an algorithm suggesting that the transfer efficiency of organic carbon, defined as the settling flux of organic carbon normalized to export production, increases with the flux of carbonate and decreases with water depth and seasonality. The algorithm predicts {$>$}80\% of the organic carbon transfer efficiency variability in diverse oceanic regions. The influence of the carbonate flux suggests that the ballasting effect of this biogenic mineral may be an important factor promoting export of organic carbon to the deep sea by increasing the density of settling particles. However, the lack of a similar effect for biogenic opal suggests that factors other than particle density also play a role. The adverse effect of increasing seasonality on the transfer efficiency of carbon to the deep sea is tentatively attributed to greater biodegradability of organic matter exported during bloom events.

  abstract = {Particle fluxes measured with time series sediment traps deployed below 2000 m at 68 sites in the world ocean are combined with satellite-derived estimates of export production from the overlying water to assess the factors affecting the transfer of particulate organic matter from surface to deep water. Multiple linear regression is used to derive an algorithm suggesting that the transfer efficiency of organic carbon, defined as the settling flux of organic carbon normalized to export production, increases with the flux of carbonate and decreases with water depth and seasonality. The algorithm predicts {$>$}80\% of the organic carbon transfer efficiency variability in diverse oceanic regions. The influence of the carbonate flux suggests that the ballasting effect of this biogenic mineral may be an important factor promoting export of organic carbon to the deep sea by increasing the density of settling particles. However, the lack of a similar effect for biogenic opal suggests that factors other than particle density also play a role. The adverse effect of increasing seasonality on the transfer efficiency of carbon to the deep sea is tentatively attributed to greater biodegradability of organic matter exported during bloom events. In high latitude opal-dominated regions with high f-ratios and seasonality, while a higher fraction of net production is exported, a higher fraction of the exported organic matter is remineralized before reaching bathypelagic depths. On the other hand, in warm, low latitude, carbonate-dominated regions with low f-ratios and seasonality, a higher fraction of the exported organic matter sinks to the deep sea.},

Despite its importance in the global carbon cycle, the biological processes that control BCPeff are poorly known. We investigate the potential role that zooplankton play in the biological carbon pump using both in situ observations and model output. Observed and modelled estimates of fast, slow and total sinking fluxes are presented from three oceanic sites: the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, the temperate North Atlantic and the equatorial Pacific oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We find that observed particle export efficiency is inversely related to primary production likely due to zooplankton grazing, in direct contrast to the model estimates. The model and observations show strongest agreement in remineralization coefficients and BCPeff at the OMZ site where zooplankton processing of particles in the mesopelagic zone is thought to be low. As the model has limited representation of zooplankton-mediated remineralization processes, we suggest that these results point to the importance of zooplankton in setting BCPeff, including particle grazing and fragmentation, and the effect of diel vertical migration. We suggest that improving parameterizations of zooplankton processes may increase the fidelity of biogeochemical model estimates of the biological carbon pump. Future changes in climate such as the expansion of OMZs may decrease the role of zooplankton in the biological carbon pump globally, hence increasing its efficiency.},

  abstract = {Sinking of marine snow is a major mechanism of particulate carbon transport from surface waters to the seafloor. Any process altering the abundance or size of marine snow influences carbon flux and food availability to pelagic and benthic organisms. We explored whether zooplankton can alter carbon transport by a new mechanism\textemdash physical fragmentation of marine snow. The fluid stress created around the appendages of swimming Euphausia pacifica is capable of fragmenting a single aggregate into multiple, smaller aggregates. The reduced size and slower sinking rate of the daughter aggregates may increase their residence time in the water column, promoting decomposition and decreasing particle flux to depth. To determine the importance of fragmentation, tethered and free-swimming euphausiids were videotaped in the presence of marine snow representing a range of aggregate strengths, sizes, and ages. Image analysis was used to characterize the particles prior to and following fragmentation and to determine the area of influence around a single euphausiid. Tethered euphausiids pulled in particles from an average of 6.7 mm away, and most aggregates were fragmented in either the region of the rapidly beating pleopods or in the high-velocity jet that forms off the tail. Euphausiids were capable of fragmenting all aggregate types and produced an average of 7.3 daughter particles, with 60\% of these daughter particles remaining within the marine snow size class ({$>$}0.5 mm). Thus, physical fragmentation by swimming euphausiids increases the abundance of marine snow while decreasing overall marine snow mass. This novel process, which alters particle size structure without loss of total particulate organic carbon (POC), will be important in upwelling regions where euphausiids are the dominant macrozooplankton migrators.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The vast majority of carbon lost from ocean surface waters sinks as large, relatively rare, marine snow and fecal pellets. Fragmentation of these particles into more slowly sinking daughter particles has been proposed previously to partly explain the rapid loss of sinking carbon below the mixed layer. In this study we investigated 2 other less obvious potential consequences of aggregate disruption, namely the release of dissolved interstitial compounds upon fragmentation and accelerated degradation due to increased particle surface area. We found that upon fragmentation natural marine aggregates, ranging in size from 3 to 6 mm diameter, released dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (mean 0.12 {$\mu$}mol aggregate\textendash 1) and nitrate (mean of 0.013 {$\mu$}mol aggregate\textendash 1) into surrounding seawater, making these nutrients available to free-living biota. Filtration of whole aggregates failed to result in an equivalent release, suggesting that marine snow may not be as leaky as expected based on high aggregate porosity. Decomposition of aggregate particulate organic carbon (POC) to DOC was similar for whole and fragmented aggregates ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 {$\mu$}mol POC aggregate\textendash 1 d\textendash 1, resulting in calculated aggregate POC turnover times of 2 to 11 d. Remineralization of DOC was also similar for both aggregate treatments and suggested a tight coupling between solubilization and uptake by attached bacteria. Our results indicate that the longer residence times predicted for smaller aggregates in the mixed layer, rather than changes in decomposition rate, may be the most influential impact of aggregate fragmentation on reduction of particle flux to depth.},

Recent work suggests that the resident zooplankton fragment, rather than ingest, the majority of encountered organic particles, thereby stimulating bacterial proliferation and the deep-ocean microbial food web. Here we speculate that this apparently counterintuitive behaviour is an example of 'microbial gardening', a strategy that exploits the enzymatic and biosynthetic capabilities of microorganisms to facilitate the 'gardener's' access to a suite of otherwise unavailable compounds that are essential for metazoan life.

  abstract = {Fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) through the oxygen deficient waters in the eastern tropical North Pacific were found to be relatively less attenuated with depth than elsewhere in the eastern North Pacific. The attenuation coefficient (b) for the flux was found to be 0.40 versus the composite value of 0.86 determined by Martin et al. (1987). To examine this further, sinking POC was collected using sediment traps and allowed to degrade in oxic and suboxic experiments. Using a kinetic model, it was found that degradation proceeded at similar rates (roughly 0.8 day-1) under oxic and suboxic conditions, but a greater fraction of bulk POC was resistant to degradation in the suboxic experiments (61\% vs. 23\%). Amino acids accounted for 37\% of POC collected at 75m, but following degradation the value dropped to 17\% and 16\% in the oxic and suboxic experiments respectively. POC collected from 500m was 10\% amino acids. The non-AA component of POC collected at 75m was not degraded under suboxic conditions, while under oxic conditions it was. These results suggest that microbes degrading OC under suboxic conditions via denitrification preferentially utilize nitrogen-rich amino acids. This preferential degradation of amino acids suggests that 9\% more nitrogen may be lost via water column denitrification than is accounted for when a more ``Redfieldian'' stoichiometry for POC is assumed.},

  abstract = {The remineralization depth of sinking organic particles controls the efficiency of the biological carbon pump by setting the sequestration timescale of remineralized carbon in the ocean interior. Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) have been identified as regions of elevated particle transfer and efficient carbon sequestration at depth, but direct measurements remain sparse in these regions and only provide snapshots of the particle flux. Here, we use remineralization tracers to reconstruct time-mean particle flux profiles in the OMZs of the Eastern Tropical Pacific and the Arabian Sea. Compared to the surrounding tropical waters, both OMZs exhibit slow flux attenuation between 100-1000m where suboxic waters reside, and sequester carbon beneath 1000m more than twice as efficiently. Using a mechanistic model of particle sinking, remineralization, and disaggregation, we show that three different mechanisms might explain the shape of the OMZ flux profiles: (i) a significant slow-down of remineralization when carbon oxidation transitions from aerobic to anaerobic respiration (e.g. denitrification); (ii) the exclusion of zooplankton that mediate disaggregation of large particles from suboxic waters (iii) the limitation of remineralization by the diffusive supply of oxidants (oxygen and nitrate) into large particles. We show that each mechanism leaves a unique signature in the size distribution of particles, suggesting that observations with optical instruments such as Underwater Vision Profilers hold great promise for understanding the drivers of efficient carbon transfer though suboxic water columns. In turn, this will allow more accurate prediction of future changes in carbon sequestration as the ocean loses oxygen in a warming climate.},

  abstract = {Comparisons of the abundances and size distributions of marine snow (aggregated particles {$>$}0.5mm in diameter) in the upper 100m of the water column at ten stations off Southern California in the late afternoon with those in the same parcel of water the following morning, after nocturnal vertical migration by zooplankton had occurred, revealed the existence of a previously undescribed process affecting marine particle dynamics. Aggregate abundances increased overnight and changes were positively and significantly correlated only with the abundance of the common euphausiid, Euphausia pacifica, and with no other biological or physical factor. Moreover, mean aggregate size decreased and aggregate size distributions shifted toward smaller size classes when euphausiids were abundant. The only conclusion consistent with these findings was that euphausiids were physically disaggregating marine snow into smaller, more numerous aggregates through shear stresses generated while swimming. Video-recording of both tethered and free-swimming E. pacifica in the laboratory dramatically confirmed that aggregates passing within 8\textendash 10mm of the animal's abdomen were fragmented either by entrainment and direct impact with the beating pleopods or by eddies generated during swimming. At the abundances observed in this study, swimming E. pacifica would have sufficiently disturbed 3\textendash 33\% of the water column each night to disrupt the aggregates contained therein. This is the first evidence for the fragmentation of large particles by the swimming activities of zooplankton and suggests that macrozooplankton and micronekton play a significant role in the particle dynamics of the water column regardless of whether they consume particles or not. Disaggregation of marine snow by swimming and migrating animals may alter the sizes of particles available to grazers and microbial colonizers and reduce the flux of particulate carbon by generating smaller particles, which potentially sink more slowly and reside longer in the water column. This newly discovered process reduces carbon flux while simultaneously conserving carbon and provides a previously unconsidered link between animal behavior and the biogeochemistry of the sea. It may help explain the exponential reduction in particle flux with depth observed in parts of the ocean and help balance oceanic carbon models.},

Particle transfer efficiency (Teff) through the mesopelagic zone is controlled by temperature and oxygen, with highest Teff for high-latitude regions and oxygen minimum zones.

The estimated MVBS exhibited distinct patterns of DVM at all three mooring sites. Between February and October, the timing of the DVM and the residence time of zooplankton at depth were clearly governed by the day\textendash night rhythm. Mean daily cycles of the ADCP-derived vertical velocity were calculated for successive months and showed maximum ascent and descent velocities of 16 and \textendash 15 mm s\`A1. However, a change of the MVBS pattern occurred in late spring/early austral summer (October/ November), when the zooplankton communities ceased their synchronous vertical migration at all three mooring sites. Elevated MVBS values were then concentrated in the uppermost layers ( o 50 m) at 66.51S. This period coincided with the decay of sea ice coverage at 641S and 66.51S between early November and mid-December. Elevated chlorophyll concentrations, which were measured at the end of the deployment, extended from 671S to 651S and indicated a phytoplankton bloom in the upper 50 m. Thus, we propose that the increased food supply associated with an ice edge bloom caused the zooplankton communities to cease their DVM in favour of feeding.},

There are usually at least two layers displaying nocturnal migration, one spending the day at depths of 300-400 m and the other at depths of 50-100 m. Reverse migrations are also found to be a common occurrence in the region studied. Usually, a surface layer begins to descend at dusk as soon as the upward migrating layer arrives in surface waters.

  abstract = {Temporal variability of acoustically estimated zooplankton biomass at the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM) site in the Sargasso Sea (at 311430N, 641100W) is described for time scales from less than an hour to the seasonal cycle primarily using data obtained between August 1996 and November 2000, and from May 10 to November 13, 2003. Concurrent high frequency BTM observations of meteorological, physical, and bio-optical variables are used to interpret processes contributing to the zooplankton variability. Zooplankton biomass estimates are derived from regressions of backscatter intensity data measured with an upward looking 153-kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and zooplankton net tow data collected near the BTM site as part of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS). Our data show clear event-scale variations. Peaks are associated with annual spring blooms involving mixed layer shoaling and in some cases passages of mesoscale eddy features. Biomass peaks are often coincident with maxima seen in BTM chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (inferred phytoplankton biomass). Some storm events do not appear to manifest in significant perturbations of zooplankton distributions; however, Hurricane Fabian (2003) greatly impacted these distributions. Estimates of zooplankton biomass and relative vertical velocity show the vertical structure of daily migration patterns. Seasonal variations in migration patterns are also evident, with diel changes in zooplankton biomass most pronounced in spring and least pronounced in winter. In summary, our high temporal resolution time series of estimated zooplankton biomass in the open ocean provide information on scales inaccessible through conventional monthly ship-based sampling. These data have implications for upper ocean ecology and the vertical transport of carbon and nitrogen through the diel migration of zooplankton.},

  abstract = {The diel vertical migration (DVM) of Calanus (Calanus finmarchicus, Calanus glacialis and Calanus hyperboreus) and Metridia longa was investigated in August 2008 at six locations to the north and northwest of Svalbard (Rijpfjorden, Ice, Marginal Ice Zone, Shelf break, Shelf and Kongsfjorden). Despite midnight sun conditions, a diel light cycle was clearly observed at all stations. We collected data on zooplankton vertical distribution using a Multi Plankton Sampler (200-{$\mu$}m mesh size) and an EK60 echosounder system (38, 120 and 200 kHz). These were supplemented by environmental data collected using a standard conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) profiler. The sea ice had recently opened in Rijpfjorden, Ice and Shelf stations, and these stations exhibited phytoplankton bloom conditions with pronounced fluorescence maxima at approximately 30~m. In contrast, Kongsfjorden was more representative of autumn conditions, with the Arctic bloom having culminated 2\textendash 3~months prior to sampling. All three Calanus species were found shallower than 50~m on average at Rijpfjorden and the Ice station, while C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus were found deeper than 200~m on average at Kongsfjorden. Shallow water DVM behaviour ({$<$}50~m) was observed at Rijpfjorden and the Shelf station, especially among the C. finmarchicus CI-CIII population, which was particularly abundant at the Shelf ({$>$}5,000 individuals/m3). A bimodal depth distribution was observed among C. finmarchicus at the Shelf break station, with CI-CIII copepodites dominating at depths shallower than 100~m and CIV-adult stages dominating at depths exceeding 600~m. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences between the day and night 200-kHz data, particularly at specified depth strata (25\textendash 50~m) where backscatter intensity was higher during the day, especially in Rijpfjorden and at the Ice station. We conclude that DVM signals exist in the Arctic during late summer/autumn, when a need to feed and an abundant food source exists, and these signals are primarily due to mesozooplankton.},

  abstract = {Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) echoes can be transformed into mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS), which is positively proportional to the biomass of zooplankton and micronekton. A mooring with an upward-looking 75-kHz ADCP was deployed on the northern slope of the South China Sea to monitor diel vertical migration (DVM) and vertical distributions of zooplankton and micronekton under general conditions and extreme conditions such as typhoons. DVM occurs throughout the year, with the maximum migrating speed reaching 9.0 cm s-1. It had some cyclic variation, which was in response to marine environment and astronomical influence. Light initiates the ascents and descents of the migrators, and migration intensity may be proportional to the solar altitude. Neap-spring tidal cycle and full moon phase influences are prominent, and the peak at 112 d may be driven by variation of currents. In addition, 270 m is the demarcation between upward and downward migrations; some organisms living below this layer, especially zooplankton and micronekton, migrate to the surface to obtain nutrients and energy; other marine mesopelagic organisms also survive in this manner. Super and severe typhoons reduced vertical migration, having less influence on the deep scattering layer. As Super Typhoon Rammasun passed by the mooring station, current speed increases and temperature decreases were synchronous with changes in the deep scattering layer; the migrators swam downward to evade the influence of a higher-speed current rather than swam upward to compensate for the decrease of temperature.},

The normal pattern involves movement from shallow depths at night to greater depths during the day. For many herbivorous and omnivorous mesozooplankton that feed predominantly near the surface on phytoplankton and microzooplankton, minimising the risk of predation from fish seems to be the ultimate factor behind DVM. These migrants appear to use deep water as a dark daytime refuge where their probability of being detected and eaten is lower than if they remained near the surface. Associated with these vertical movements of mesozooplankton, predators at higher trophic levels, including invertebrates, fish, marine mammals, birds and reptiles, may modify their behaviour to optimise the exploitation of their vertically migrating prey. Recent advances in biotelemetry promise to allow the interaction between migrating zooplankton and diving air-breathing vertebrates to be explored in far more detail than hitherto.},

  abstract = {Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a common behavior adopted by zooplankton species. DVM is a prominent adaptation for avoiding visual predation during daylight hours and still being able to feed on surface phytoplankton blooms during night. Here, we report on a DVM study using a Video Plankton Recorder (VPR), a tool that allows mapping of vertical zooplankton distributions with a far greater spatial resolution than conventional zooplankton nets. The study took place over a full day\textendash night cycle in Disko Bay, Greenland, during the peak of the phytoplankton spring bloom. The sampling revealed a large abundance of copepods performing DVM (up during night and down during day). Migration behavior was expressed differently among the abundant groups with either a strong DVM (euphausiids), an absence of DVM (i.e.,~permanently deep; ostracods) or a marked DVM, driven by strong surface avoidance during the day and more variable depth preferences at night (Calanus spp.). The precise individual depth position provided by the VPR allowed us to conclude that the escape from surface waters during daytime reduces feeding opportunities but also lowers the risk of predation (by reducing the light exposure) and thereby is likely to influence both state (hunger, weight and stage) and survival. The results suggest that the copepods select day and night time habitats with similar light levels (\textasciitilde 10-9~{$\mu$}mol photon~s-1~m-2). Furthermore, Calanus spp.~displayed state-dependent behavior, with DVM most apparent for smaller individuals, and a deeper residence depth for the larger individuals.},

The OMZ was the most dramatic feature of the water column and seemed to determine the extent of migration: Stylocheiron affine migrated only to the shallow oxycline; whereas Euphausia mucronata, Euphausia eximia, Euphausia distinguenda and Euphausia tenera migrated to the core of the OMZ; and Nematoscelis gracilis to beneath the core of the OMZ. Some differences were also found in the timing and duration of the ascent and descent, and residence times in shallow and deep layers. E. mucronata, N. gracilis and E. distinguenda displayed a normal descent during sunrise, and ascent during sunset. E. eximia and E. tenera also descended during sunrise but seemed to begin their ascent earlier in the afternoon and consequently shortened their deep residence times. S. affine showed the most extended residence times at the shallow layer and the shortest vertical displacement. Day and night vertical stratification and differences in the timing of migration into and out of the OMZ of the HCE suggest a community structure based on habitat partitioning whereby species avoided co-occurrence in time and space. Species-specific patterns of vertical stratification and migratory chronology are examined with regard to body and gill sizes, feeding adaptations of euphausiids, and potential food resources at the OMZ.},

A close relationship between the abundance of the whole copepod population and low oxygen waters was found, with most developmental stages remaining near the base of the oxycline (30\textendash 80 m) and within the upper zone of the OMZ (30\textendash 200 m).

This strategy of movement would result in a better utilization of food resources since the strong physical and chemical gradients at the base of the oxycline and upper OMZ boundary might serve as a site of particle accumulation. A secondary fluorescence peak was, in fact, found at all the stations, coinciding with minimal dissolved oxygen (DO, \&lt;1 mL O2 L-1) at the base of the oxycline or in the upper OMZ boundary. The relevance of the biogeochemical flux involved in this diel migration pattern was assessed by calculating the potential active input of carbon and nitrogen from the upper layers into deeper the OMZ.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of metabolic rates of euphausiid diel vertical migrants in the ocean is of paramount importance to understand the role of these organisms in the downward transport of carbon due to their feeding in the epipelagic zone and subsequent respiration, egestion, excretion and mortality in the mesopelagic zone. Enzymatic activities are used as proxies for the estimation of metabolism in deep waters because of the logistical problems related to measure these rates at depth. However, metabolic activities of euphausiids in the so-called oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are still not well understood. The OMZs are expanding as the effect of the global warming. Knowledge about the metabolic response of organisms transiting these zones will help to understand the fate of zooplanktonic communities and vertical active flux. The electron transport system (ETS) and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS) activities were used as proxies for potential respiration and growth in planktonic organisms. Here, we measured these enzymatic activities in Euphausia distinguenda in the well-oxygenated epipelagic layer and in the OMZ of the northern boundary of the Eastern Tropical Pacific off Mexico. E. distinguenda was found in the mixed layer at night (\textasciitilde 3.5 mL O2 L-1) and near the core of the OMZ (0.2 mL O2 L-1) during daytime between 200 and 350 m depth. We found higher ETS and AARS specific activities in the warm mixed layer at night and significantly lower in the colder OMZ during daytime because of temperature differences. However, when the effect of temperature was subtracted in both enzyme activities, higher values in the mesopelagic layer were observed. This result is tentatively explained by the increase in substrates as the effect of feeding at night in the upper layers and their oxygen consumption at depth during day in order to compensate for the colder temperature and low dissolved oxygen concentration. This physiological mechanism allows E. distinguenda diel vertical migrants to partly face the physical constraints of vertical migration imposed to avoid predators.},

The area has a pronounced oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) that impacts the distribution of both migrating and mesopelagic species. Sampling was conducted at a relatively fine scale (mesopelagic depth intervals as small as 25 m) within ecologically relevant strata to assess how this hydrographic environment influenced the structure of these groups. Zooplankton were collected in vertically stratified Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System tows during the day and the night, and abundances were analyzed in association with variations in oxygen concentration, temperature and depth. Each vertical stratum of the water column was a unique ecological zone with a specific community makeup. The upper and midwater column (0\textendash 550 m) was strongly influenced by diel vertical migration patterns, particularly the daytime descent of euphausiids and myctophid fish into the core of the OMZ. Distinctly different communities occurred below the OMZ core. The lower oxycline (LO) ({$\sim$}500\textendash 700 m depth range) was dominated by Cyclothone spp. fish as well as a diverse population of other taxa, often aggregated into a discrete layer (25 m thick), particularly in 2008. In the suboxycline (\&gt;700 m depth range), the community shifted to typical bathypelagic taxa. These finer scale vertical patterns provided new insight into the ecological structure of OMZs, revealing the unique layering at the LO and differential impacts on diel vertical migrators.},

A pulse of P. periphylla left upper layers already a few hours after sunset, and there was interchange of individuals between shallow and deep water throughout the night, including ascent of individuals from the apparent nonmigrating deepest SL.

This coordinated, process-oriented approach has the potential to foster new insights on ocean carbon cycling that maximizes its societal relevance through the achievement of research goals of many international research agencies and will be a key step towards our understanding of the Earth as an integrated system.},

  abstract = {A basic problem in marine biogeochemistry is understanding material and elemental distributions and fluxes in the oceans, and a key part of this problem is understanding the processes that affect particulate material in the ocean. Aggregation of particulate material is a primary process because it alters the transport properties of particulate material and provides a mechanism for transferring material from the dissolved into the particulate pools. Aggregation theory not only provides a framework for understanding these processes, but it also provides a means for making predictions and has been successfully used to predict maximum particle concentrations in the oceans and the fate of diatom blooms (including those from iron fertilization), the size spectra of particles in the oceans, and the size distributions of trace metals. Here we review the basic theory involved, summarize recent developments, and explore unresolved issues.},

  abstract = {One pathway of the biological pump that remains largely unquantified in many export models is the active transport of carbon from the surface ocean to the mesopelagic by zooplankton diel vertical migration (DVM). Here, we develop a simple representation of zooplankton DVM and implement it in a global export model as a thought experiment to illustrate the effects of DVM on carbon export and mesopelagic biogeochemistry. The model is driven by diagnostic satellite measurements of net primary production, algal biomass, and phytoplankton size structure. Due to constraints on available satellite data, the results are restricted to the latitude range from 60\textdegree N to 60\textdegree S. The modeled global export flux from the base of the euphotic zone was 6.5 PgC/year, which represents a 14\% increase over the export flux in model runs without DVM. The mean ({$\pm$} standard deviation, SD) proportional contribution of the DVM-mediated export flux to total carbon export, averaged over the global domain and the climatological seasonal cycle, was 0.16 {$\pm$} 0.04 and the proportional contribution of DVM activity to total respiration within the twilight zone was 0.16 {$\pm$} 0.06. Adding DVM activity to the model also resulted in a deep local maximum in the oxygen utilization profile. The model results were most sensitive to the assumptions for the fraction of individuals participating in DVM, the fraction of fecal pellets produced in the euphotic zone, and the fraction of grazed carbon that is metabolized.},

  abstract = {Throughout the ocean, countless small animals swim to depth in the daytime, presumably to seek refuge from large predators. These animals return to the surface at night to feed. This substantial diel vertical migration can result in the transfer of significant amounts of carbon and nutrients from the surface to depth. However, its consequences on ocean chemistry at the global scale have remained uncertain. Here, we determine the depths of these diel migrations in the global ocean using a global array of backscatter data from acoustic Doppler current profilers, collected between 1990 and 2011. We show that the depth of diel migration follows coherent large-scale patterns. We find that migration depth is greater where subsurface oxygen concentrations are high, such that seawater oxygen concentration is the best single predictor of migration depth at the global scale. In oxygen minimum zone areas, migratory animals generally descend as far as the upper margins of the low-oxygen waters. Using an ocean biogeochemical model coupled to a general circulation model, we show that by focusing oxygen consumption in poorly ventilated regions of the upper ocean, diel vertical migration intensifies oxygen depletion in the upper margin of oxygen minimum zones. We suggest that future changes in the extent of oxygen minimum zones could alter the migratory depths of marine organisms, with consequences for marine biogeochemistry, food webs and fisheries.},

  abstract = {The least known component of the ``biological pump'' is the active transport of carbon and nutrients by diel vertical migration of zooplankton. We measured CO2 respiration and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) excretion by individual species of common vertically migrating zooplankton at the US JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) station. The inclusion of DOC excretion in this study builds on published research on active transport by respiration of inorganic carbon and allows a direct assessment of the role of zooplankton in the production of dissolved organic matter used in midwater microbial processes. On average, excretion of DOC makes up 24\% (range=5\textendash 42\%) of the total C metabolized (excreted+respired) and could represent a significant augmentation to the vertical flux that has already been documented for respiratory CO2 flux by migrant zooplankton. Migratory fluxes were compared to other transport processes at BATS. Estimates of combined active transport of CO2 and DOC by migrators at BATS averaged 7.8\% and reached 38.6\% of mean sinking POC flux at 150 m, and reached 71.4\% of mean sinking POC flux at 300 m. DOC export by migrator excretion averaged 1.9\% and reached 13.3\% of annual DOC export by physical mixing at this site. During most of the year when deep mixing does not occur, diel migration by zooplankton could provide a supply of DOC to the deeper layers that is available for use by the microbial community. A carbon budget comparing migrant zooplankton transport to the balance of fluxes in the 300\textendash 600 m depth strata at BATS shows on average that the total migrant flux supplies 37\% of the organic carbon remineralized in this layer, and that migrant DOC flux is more than 3 times the DOC flux gradient by diapycnal mixing. New estimates of active transport of both organic and inorganic carbon by migrants may help resolve observed imbalances in the C budget at BATS, but the magnitude is highly dependent on the biomass of the migrating community.},

  abstract = {Zooplankton are important consumers of sinking particles in the ocean's twilight zone. However, the impact of different taxa depends on their feeding mode. In contrast to typical suspension-feeding zooplankton, flux-feeding taxa preferentially consume rapidly-sinking particles that would otherwise penetrate into the deep ocean. To quantify the potential impact of two flux-feeding zooplankton taxa (Aulosphaeridae [Rhizaria], and Limacina helicina [euthecosome pteropod]) and the total suspension-feeding zooplankton community, we measured depth-stratified abundances of these organisms during six cruises in the California Current Ecosystem. Using allometric-scaling relationships, we computed the percentage of carbon flux intercepted by flux feeders and suspension feeders. These estimates were compared to direct measurements of carbon flux attenuation made using drifting sediment traps and 238U-234Th disequilibrium. We found that carbon flux attenuation in the shallow twilight zone typically ranged from 500 \textendash{} 1000 \textmu mol organic C flux remineralized per 10-m vertical depth bin. This equated to approximately 6 \textendash{} 10\% of carbon flux remineralized / 10 m. The two flux-feeding taxa considered in this study could account for a substantial proportion of this flux near the base of the euphotic zone. The mean flux attenuation attributable to Aulosphaeridae was 0.69\% / 10 m (median = 0.21\%/10 m, interquartile range = 0.04 \textendash{} 0.81\%) at their depth of maximum abundance (\textasciitilde 100 m), which would equate to \textasciitilde{} 10\% of total flux attenuation in this depth range. The maximum flux attenuation attributable to Aulosphaeridae reached 4.2\% / 10 m when these protists were most abundant. L. helicina, meanwhile, could intercept 0.45 \textendash{} 1.6\% of carbon flux / 10 m, which was slightly greater (on average) than the Aulosphaeridae. In contrast, suspension-feeding zooplankton in the mesopelagic (including copepods, euphausiids, appendicularians, and ostracods) had combined clearance rates of 2\textendash 81 L m-3 d-1 (mean of 19.6 L m-3 d-1). This implies a substantial impact on slowly sinking particles, but a negligible impact on the presumably rapidly-sinking fecal pellets that comprised the majority of the material collected in sediment traps. Our results highlight the need for a greater research focus on the many taxa that potentially act as flux feeders in the oceanic twilight zone.},

Here we investigate the offshore Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) where a secondary chlorophyll a maximum resides within the ODZ. Rates of primary production and carbon export from the mixed layer and productivity in the primary chlorophyll a maximum were consistent with oligotrophic waters. However, sediment trap carbon and nitrogen fluxes increased between 105 and 150\,m, indicating organic matter production within the ODZ. Metagenomic and metaproteomic characterization indicated that the secondary chlorophyll a maximum was attributable to the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, and numerous photosynthesis and carbon fixation proteins were detected. The presence of chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaea and the nitrite oxidizer Nitrospina and detection of nitrate oxidoreductase was consistent with cyanobacterial oxygen production within the ODZ. Cyanobacteria and cyanophage were also present on large ({$>$}30\,{$\mu$}m) particles and in sediment trap material. Particle cyanophage-to-host ratio exceeded 50, suggesting that viruses help convert cyanobacteria into sinking organic matter. Nitrate reduction and anammox proteins were detected, congruent with previously reported N2 production. We suggest that autochthonous organic matter production within the ODZ contributes to N2 production in the offshore ETNP.},

Spatial patterns of primary production are in general determined by supply of macronutrients (nitrate, phosphate) from below the thermocline. Where the thermocline is shallow and intersects the lighted euphotic zone, biological production is enhanced. In the eastern tropical Pacific thermocline depth is controlled by three interrelated processes: a basin-scale east/west thermocline tilt, a basin-scale thermocline shoaling at the gyre margins, and local wind-driven upwelling. These processes regulate supply of nutrient-rich subsurface waters to the euphotic zone, and on their basis we have divided the eastern tropical Pacific into seven main regions. Primary production and its physical and chemical controls are described for each.},

Factors influencing these rates were investigated in two locations: the Washington state and NW Mexican continental margins. The Mexican continental margin is in contact with the oxygen deficient zone of the eastern tropical North Pacific. Carbon budgets for the Washington and Mexican margins indicated a larger percentage of the surface export flux reached the sediments and a greater fraction of the material arrived at the seafloor escaped degradation to be buried permanently. The attenuation in the carbon oxidation rate with water column depth for the Mexican margin was less than is typical of other margin regions. Empirical attenuation coefficients derived from a power function relation were 0.931 and 0.439 for the Washington and Mexican margins, respectively. Multi-G type models suggested that organic matter degraded in Mexican sediments was less reactive than that in Washington sediments. Sediment slurry and whole-core incubations were conducted to assess the effects of mixing and oxygen exposure on the rate and extent of carbon degradation. Sediments from the Mexican oxygen-deficient zone were less susceptible to degradation than sediments from the oxic Mexican shelf and the Washington margin under all incubation conditions, suggesting that the organic matter in the oxygen-deficient zone may be intrinsically less reactive. The isotopic fractionation of oxygen and nitrogen during respiration was measured on both margins. The apparent respiration fractionation factor, A, for oxygen under conditions of carbon-limited degradation was 0.992. It was hypothesized that long oxygen exposure times, respiration under isotopically fractionating conditions and organic carbon:mineral surface-area ratios less than 1.0 are each related to the extent of degradation and imply low carbon burial efficiencies. High carbon burial efficiencies (and low carbon oxidation efficiencies) were found in oxygen-deficient zone sediments which had short oxygen exposure times, little or no fractionation of oxygen and nitrogen and carbon: surface-area ratios {$>$}3.0.},

  abstract = {A select group of marine organisms can enter the Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) and even anoxic waters, while performing diel vertical migration (DVM). DVM of the euphausiid Euphausia eximia off northern Chile in the spring of 2015 was documented based on acoustic measurements using an echo sounder along with net samplings. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were obtained using a vertical profiler, and water samples were collected to obtain in situ nitrite (NO2-) concentrations as well as pHT, total alkalinity (AT), and therefore carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) was estimated. Krill were found to migrate up to the surface (0\textendash 50~m) during the night and returned to ca. 200\textendash 300~m depth during the day, spending between 11 and 14~h at these layers. At the surface, DO and NO2- concentrations were 208 and 0.14~{$\mu$}M respectively, while pHT was 8.04 and 405 {$\mu$}atm pCO2. In contrast, at the deeper layers (200\textendash 300~m), DO and NO2- were\,{$<$}\,3 and 6.3~{$\mu$}M respectively, with pHT 7.53 and 1490 {$\mu$}atm pCO2. The pHT and high pCO2 values at depths represent the conditions predicted for open ocean waters in a worst-case global warming scenario by 2150. The acoustic scatter suggested that\,{$>$}\,60\% of the krill swarms enter the OMZ and anoxic waters during the daytime. These frequent migrations suggest that krill can tolerate such extreme conditions associated with anoxic and high-pCO2 waters. The inferences drawn from the observation of these migrations might have strong implications for the current oceanic carbon pump models, highlighting the need for understanding the molecular and physiological adaptations allowing these migrations.},

Here, we highlight structural and functional features of pelagic OMZ zooplankton communities, especially the little known mesopelagic lower oxycline zooplankton assemblage in the eastern tropical north Pacific (ETNP). Day and night vertically-stratified zooplankton samples were collected with a MOCNESS plankton net system to depths of 1000 m during two cruises in 2007 and 2008 as part of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Project. Size-fractionated biomass and selected species distributions were analyzed. A spatial comparison between two stations, Tehuantepec Bowl (TB) and Costa Rica Dome (CRD), with different OMZ thicknesses especially in 2008, was used as a proxy for future potential climate change to show how variability in oxycline depth at the upper and lower OMZ boundaries may have broad consequences for biological distributions and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {This thesis aims to identify and estimate the significance of lateral transport of particulate organic matter in the deep water-column of the Benguela upwelling system (BUS) offshore southwestern Africa. Although the BUS is regarded as the most productive of the four major eastern boundary systems of the ocean, and therefore of high importance for the global marine carbon cycle, little information is available on processes and fluxes involved in particulate matter transport in this area. Above the continental slope, water layers strongly enriched in particle content are identified in intermediate water depths and in the lowermost water column. These layers are termed intermediate and bottom nepheloid layers (INLs and BNLs, respectively). In such layers, the major part of the advective particle transport is supposed to take place. A pronounced BNL covers the entire study area with maximum intensity above the outer shelf and at the shelf break. The detachment of this BNL at the shelf break feeds a major INL in 250 to 400 m water depth at 25.5\~A \textdegree S, positioned at the lower boundary of the oxygen minimum zone. Together, these strong subsurface nepheloid layers are indicators of intensive lateral particle transport from the outer shelf towards a depocenter of organic matter (OM) on the upper continental slope. The results on distribution, transport and quality of organic matter presented in this thesis confirm the major significance of lateral transport of pre-aged, but well-preserved organic particles in the highly-productive Benguela upwelling area. Many indications suggest that the results from this study are also applicable to other continental margin settings. For example, high 14C-ages of SPM and the deposition of OC-rich sediments with high hydrocarbon potential on the upper continental slope is also known from other high-productive areas of the modern ocean. Thus, the results may improve our understanding of the genesis of black shales and petroleum source rocks in the geological record, to which these depocenters may represent a modern analogue. Additionally, it is shown that advective processes have the potential to displace areas of enhanced OC burial effectively from maximum production cells along the coast towards the slope and possibly the deep-sea. These results limit the validity of often used, merely vertically oriented particle flux models. The findings from the BUS identify lateral transport as an important, yet hardly recognized, secondary mechanism, effectively transferring carbon from the atmosphere to long-term sequestration in the sediments. Therewith, the results contribute to the improvement of global models to predict the impact of environmental changes on the oceanic system.},
