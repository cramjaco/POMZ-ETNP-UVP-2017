# Note To self

This data was aggregated with the following code

```
Simple Binned ESS
ESS %>% filter(depth <= 500, profile == "stn_043") %>% select(depth, lb, ub, vol, TotalParticles) %>% dput
```
# Background on data and problem
I have a data-set where particles of different sizes, at different depths in the ocean.

They are measured by an underwater vision profiler. This is a camera, that counts and sizes particles in a given volume of water.

There are frequently zero particles sampled and I'd like to use what I do know about relationships between particles across size and depth to estemate the abundances of particles of different sizes at different depth.

Here are a few things that I think are *mostly* true. 
1) Particles follow power law size distribution spectrum. That is, when you normalize particle numbers to the width of the particle size bin (see below). They have a more or less linear relatinship such that log(number) ~ log(size).

2) Particles of any given size follow a power law size distribution with respect to depth, such that log(number) ~ log(depth).

I don't expect these relationships to be perfect, so I've been using gams to allow for some deviation from these patterns.

Since my particles are of known number, I'm assuming that they are sampled from a binomial distribution. I also tried a poisson distribution but got some strange results.

I'd like to try using baysean approaches to see if I get similar results to these frequentist approaches.

```{r}
#data <- ESS %>% filter(depth <= 500, profile == "stn_043") %>% select(depth, lb, ub, vol, TotalParticles)
```

# Set up
## Configuration
I am using tidyverse for data handling and mgcv for gams
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(mgcv)
```

```{r}
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

## Data
Here's some data. This is one profile, truncated to the top 500m.

Particles are binned by size. And the number of particles in each size bin, at each depth are recorded.

In `data`, depth is measured as meters depth in the water column. `lb` is the lower bound of the size bin `ub` is the upper bound of the size bin, measured in mm, `vol` is the volume sampled (L) and `TotalParticles` are the number of particles seen in that bin.

The following heading gives an idea of how these data look:
```{r}
head(data)
```

I next make a few extra parameters: `binsize` is the difference between `lb` and `ub`. `nparticles` are the particles normalized to volume, measured in (Particles/L) and `n_nparticles` is the number of particles normalized both to volume and bin-size (Particles/L/mm)
```{r}
data01 <- data %>% mutate(binsize = ub-lb, nparticles = TotalParticles/vol, n_nparticles = nparticles/binsize)
data01 %>% head
```

Here I show how total particle count (not normalized to volume or binsize), relates to depth and particle size.
```{r}
data01Plot <- data01 %>% group_by(lb) %>% ggplot(aes(x = TotalParticles, y = depth, col = log(lb), group = lb)) + scale_y_reverse() + geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + scale_color_viridis_c() + geom_path() + geom_vline(xintercept = 1) + geom_vline(xintercept = 5)
data01Plot
```

In the figure above, you can see that at all depths, tere are many small particles, and fewer large particles. The largist particles are not detected below the shallowist depth. The intermediatly large particles (lb ≈ 1 mm) are sometimes detected a few times, sometimes once, and sometimes not at all, below the surface. You can see that all particle sizes are most abundant at the surface.

Below, I show a similar plot, but here we are looking at particle abundance, normalized to binsize and volume sampled:

```{r}
nnPlot <- data01 %>% group_by(lb) %>% ggplot(aes(x = n_nparticles, y = depth, col = log(lb), group = lb)) + scale_y_reverse() + geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + scale_color_viridis_c() + geom_path() + geom_vline(xintercept = 1) + geom_vline(xintercept = 5) + labs(x = "Normalized Particles (#/L/mm)")
nnPlot
```
You can see that this looks similar to the plot above.

### Examining particle size distributions within depths

I would like to estemate the true abundance of all of these size fractions, but especially the particles of intermediate abundance, that show up sometimes once, sometimes a few times, and sometimes not at all. 

I would like to estemate these from both the abundance of particles above and below that particle, but also from the abundance of smaller particles.

The data at each depth, more-or-less follow a power law, where the log of the size is more-or-less linearly related to the log of the volume and bin-width normalized abundance.

```{r}
data_125m <- data01 %>% filter(depth == 125)
data_125m %>% ggplot(aes(x = lb, y = n_nparticles)) + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() + geom_point() + labs(y = "Normalized Particles (#/L/mm)")
``` 

In the plot above I plot size (`lb`) against particle abundance normalized to bin width and volume.

Of course, the large particles > 1.5mm are so rare that we don't detect them.

### General linear model fit -- one depth
I can fit this curve with a negative binomial family general linear model. The negative binomial is nice because it allows for count data, including zeros, which inform the model, but aren't treated as true zeros. I have to use the `TotalParticle` data so that these are actually counts, and then specify an "offset" of the parameters which I use to normalize those data.
```{r}
myGlm <- function(df){
  MASS::glm.nb(TotalParticles ~ log(lb) + offset(log(vol * binsize)), data = df)
}

mod_125m <- myGlm(data_125m)
summary(mod_125m)
```
Then I estemate glm predicted abundances
```{r}
pred_glm_125m <- predict(mod_125m, type = "link", se.fit = TRUE) %>% as_tibble %>% mutate(lower = fit - 2 * se.fit, upper = fit + 2 * se.fit) %>%
  mutate(glmFit = exp(fit), glmLower = exp(lower), glmUpper = exp(upper)) %>% select(-c(fit, lower, upper))
```

And then I combine the predictions with the original data, and plot everything.
```{r}
df_125m <- bind_cols(data_125m, pred_glm_125m) %>% mutate(glmFit = glmFit/vol/binsize, glmLower = glmLower/vol/binsize, glmUpper = glmUpper/vol/binsize) 

ggplot(df_125m, aes(x = lb)) + geom_point(aes(y = glmFit), shape = 1) + geom_point(aes(y = n_nparticles)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = glmLower, ymax = glmUpper)) +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() + labs(y = "Normalized Particle Abundance \n (Observed + Predicted) (#/L/mm)")
```

In the plot above, the open circles are the predicted values. The closed circles are the observed values.  For my subsequent analyses, I could for instance use these to estemate the larger particles, when we don't see them, or all large particles.

### General additive model -- one depth
Another option, is to use a general additive model (gam). In this case, everything is pretty linear, but gams allow for some deviation from the power law relationship.

```{r}
myGam <- function(df){
  gam(TotalParticles ~ s(log(lb)), offset = log(vol * binsize), family = nb(), data = df)
}

mod1_125m <- myGam(data_125m)
summary(mod1_125m)
AIC(mod1_125m)
```

```{r}
pred1_tp_125m <- predict(mod1_125m, type = "link", se.fit = TRUE) %>% as.data.frame %>% mutate(lower = fit - 2 * se.fit, upper = fit + 2 * se.fit) %>%
  #translate back into response units
  mutate(gamFit = exp(fit), gamLower = exp(lower), gamUpper = exp(upper)) #%>% select(-c(fit, lower, upper))


df1_125m <- bind_cols(df_125m,  pred1_tp_125m)


ggplot(df1_125m, aes(x = lb)) + geom_point(aes(y = gamFit), shape = 1) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = gamLower, ymax = gamUpper)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = n_nparticles)) + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()
```

The figure above mirros the one for the GLM, but here, we use a gam fit instead.

The bend to the line is very subtle, with wider (and I think more believable) confedence intervals. Every observed, non-zero, value is inside of the confedence intervals. Also, for the points with no values, the confedence intervals get larger.

#### Functions I will use later.
Here are some bookkeeping functions, that allow us to redo the above calculations with one function.

```{r}
expand_with_gam <- function(df, mod){
  loc_pred <- predict(mod, type = "link", se.fit = TRUE) %>% as.data.frame %>% mutate(lower = fit - 2 * se.fit, upper = fit + 2 * se.fit) %>% mutate(resp_fit = exp(fit), resp_lower = exp(lower), resp_upper = exp(upper))
  loc_df <- bind_cols(df, loc_pred)
  loc_df
}

gam_size_ggplot <- function(df){
  ggplot(df, aes(x = lb)) + geom_point(aes(y = resp_fit), shape = 1) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = resp_lower, ymax = resp_upper)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = n_nparticles)) + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10()
}
```

Testing the bookeeping functions
```{r}
expand_with_gam(df_125m, mod1_125m) %>% gam_size_ggplot
```


## Whole water column, by size only

I can loop the above gam over each depth, to estemate the size distribution throughout the water column.

```{r}
dataGamHorizontal <- data01 %>% group_by(depth) %>% nest %>% mutate(mod = map(data, myGam)) %>%
  mutate(data2 = map2(data, mod, expand_with_gam)) %>% select(-data, -mod)%>% unnest(data2)
dataGamHorizontal %>% head
```

```{r fig.height = 6, fig.width=6}
library(cowplot)

horizontalGamPlot <- dataGamHorizontal %>% ggplot(aes(x = resp_fit, y = depth, col = log(lb), group = lb)) + scale_y_reverse() + geom_point() + scale_x_log10(limits = c(10^-8, NA)) + scale_color_viridis_c() + geom_path() + geom_vline(xintercept = 1) + geom_vline(xintercept = 5)  + geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = resp_lower, xmax = resp_upper), width = 10, alpha = 0.5)+ theme_bw()

plot_grid(nnPlot, horizontalGamPlot, nrow = 2)
```

Above you see the observed (top), and predicted values (bottom). The predicted values seem ok. However there is discontenuity between adjacent depths that may or may not be real.


## Whole water column, by depth

Another option is to do just about the same thing, but this time look at the relationship between depths, while ignoring the particle size distribution. Here we take advantage of the power law relationship with respect to depth.

```{r}
verticalGam <- function(df){
  gam(TotalParticles ~ s(log(depth)), offset = log(vol * binsize), family = nb(), data = df)
}

dataGamVertical <- data01 %>% group_by(lb) %>% nest %>% mutate(mod = map(data, verticalGam)) %>%
  mutate(data2 = map2(data, mod, expand_with_gam)) %>% select(-data, -mod)%>% unnest(data2)
dataGamVertical %>% head
```

```{r}
verticalGamPlot <- dataGamVertical %>% ggplot(aes(x = resp_fit, y = depth, col = log(lb), group = lb)) + scale_y_reverse() + geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + scale_color_viridis_c() + geom_path() + geom_vline(xintercept = 1) + geom_vline(xintercept = 5) + geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = resp_lower, xmax = resp_upper), width = 10, alpha = 0.5) + theme_bw()
verticalGamPlot
```

In the figure above, we see the predicted values (with confedence intervals) using gams that smooth vertically but do not considere the power law of the particle size distribution. Particles larger than 1mm have unusually low predicted values, that don't change monotonically wiht particle size.There are also huge confedence intervals for the small particles. I'm suspicious that they seem to overlap the observed particles.

That said, for the smaller size particles, these patterns seem reasonable.

# Depth and Size Together
I can also use a gam to try to incorperate size and depth together:

Confession, I didn't have this working when I originally asked Dong Liang for a Baysean approach to do essentially this. The folowing approach, I think, mostly solves my immediate problem. That said, I'd be interested to see how this would be done with a baysean hierarchical framework and what differences it might show with this framework.


```{r}
my_double_gam <- function(df){
  gam(TotalParticles ~s(log(lb), log(depth)), offset = log(vol * binsize), family = nb(), data = data01)
}
doubleSmooth <- my_double_gam(data01)

#doubleSmooth <- gam(TotalParticles ~s(log(lb), log(depth)), offset = log(vol * binsize), family = nb(), data = data01)

#doubleSmooth <- gam(TotalParticles ~ s(log(lb)) + log(depth), offset = log(vol * binsize), family = quasipoisson(), data = data01)
```

```{r}
summary(doubleSmooth)
AIC(doubleSmooth)
```

Below, I confirm that the smooth term with both components does a beter job than a linear relationship including both variables.
```{r}
linearSum <- gam(TotalParticles ~ log(lb) + log(depth), offset = log(vol * binsize), family = nb(), data = data01)
summary(linearSum)
multSum <- gam(TotalParticles ~ log(lb) * log(depth), offset = log(vol * binsize), family = nb(), data = data01)
summary(multSum)
AIC(linearSum,
  multSum,
  doubleSmooth
)
```

The gam with smoothes has the lowest AIC, so I'm going with that.

Here I predict the variables:

```{r}
predDS <- predict(doubleSmooth, type = "link", se.fit = TRUE)

dataPredDS <- data01 %>% bind_cols(link_pred = predDS$fit, link_se = predDS$se) %>% 
  mutate(link_lower = link_pred - 2 * link_se, link_upper = link_pred + 2 * link_se) %>%
  mutate(resp_pred = exp(link_pred), resp_lower = exp(link_lower), resp_upper = exp(link_upper))
```


Original data, again, for reference.
```{r}
nnPlot
```

Gam data.

```{r}
predDSPlot <- dataPredDS %>% group_by(lb) %>% ggplot(aes(x = resp_pred, y = depth, col = log(lb), group = lb)) + scale_y_reverse() + geom_point() + geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = resp_lower, xmax = resp_upper), width = 10) +  scale_color_viridis_c() + geom_path() + geom_vline(xintercept = 1) + geom_vline(xintercept = 5)  + scale_x_log10()
predDSPlot
```

As above, but focusing on the at least sort-of abundant particles.
```{r}
#predDSPlot + scale_x_log10(limits = c(1e-22, NA))
predDSPlot + scale_x_log10(limits = c(1e-3, NA))
```

So in general, I like this two component gam model. That said, I'd be interested to see if we can pull additonal insight from higherarchical baysean approaches.
